Reports From Elected Officials
Manhattan Borough ● The online portals are now open for any organization to apply for City
President Mark Levine’s capital funding for projects in FY25. For more detailed information about
Office, presented by Tricia the application process for capital funding in FY25, go to FY 2025 MBP
Shimamura Capital Funding
● Our City is failing New Yorkers with serious mental illness. To better
serve such New Yorkers, our office has launched a campaign called
“Breaking the Cycle”, which calls for:
○ Expansion in the number of long-term psychiatric beds
○ Initiatives to address the severe shortage of clinical staff in
behavioral health
○ Concrete steps to develop more supportive housing
○ Expansion of community-based and peer led programs
○ Doubling of Intensive Mobile Treatment teams for street outreach
○ Giving EMS workers the ability to provide opioid withdrawal
treatment medication
● Community Board applications are now open! Click here for more
information: Community Board applications The deadline is Feb. 24.
Current community board members seeking to continue their service are
required to fill out a re-application form prior to the expiration of their term.
● The MBP’s Office honors the extraordinary service of Jeffrey LeFrancois
as MCB4 Chair for the last two years!
NYC Councilmember Erik ● Working with MCB4, we accomplished a lot last year, including:
Bottcher’s Office, ○ the 10th Ave. bike lane, which will be extended down to the
presented by Jordan Feiner southern tip of MCD4 later this year;
○ the complete redesign of the Penn South playground as an ADA
accessible playground
○ the appointment of a 7A Administrator at 410 West 46th street
○ landmarking the Former Color School #4 on West 17th street and
securing money to preserve it!
○ We look forward to many more wins this year!
NYS Assemblymember ● Our office introduced two bills last month (A8362 and A8446) to address
Tony Simone’s Office, the problem of constructive eviction by greedy property owners.
● Assemblymember Simone was a keynote speaker at the West Side Tenants
Conference last month, where residents from all over NYC came togetherpresented by Ben to learn about tenant organizing and how to protect themselves from bad
Lowenstein landlords.
● NYC is in the middle of an affordability crisis and housing is the most
salient part of that crisis. That's why the State must pass critical tenant
protections like Good Cause Eviction rules and expand the right to council
statewide.
NYC Mayor Eric Adam’s ● Last month the Mayor, along with Commissioner Tish, announced a new
Office, presented by Robin generation of technology to enhance snow removal operations. It’s called
Forst Blade Runner 2.0. It will centralize the deployment of the equipment and
will do real-time tracking of the equipment.
● The City Council recently passed legislation (Intro 586) which requires
police officers to document every encounter they have with any person.
This could lead to an over-abundance of documentation by police officers if
they have to document every single person they talk to on the streets if a
child is missing. We think the City will be safer and more police officers
will be on the streets without this legislation.
● The number of migrants arriving in our city has not abated. The Mayor
initiated an Executive Order that requires the migrants who arrive by bus to
arrive only at certain hours and with advance notice. It’s a work in progress
but we have to stem the tide. We are appreciative of how MCB4 has
stepped up to help the incoming migrants.
US Congressman Jerry ● Congressman Nadler helped to secure billions of dollars in federal
Nadler’s Office, presented investments for New York infrastructure projects thanks to the Bipartisan
by Hannah Weinerman Infrastructure Law which included:
○ $6.88 billion in federal funds for Gateway, the largest federal
transportation grant in history
○ $2.4 billion for the 2nd Avenue subway extension to 125th Street
○ $3.8 billion in additional funding, securing the much needed
Northeast Corridor rail project
○ $2.9 billion to extend Metro North service to Penn Station and
renew the East River Tunnels
● All three major insulin manufacturers (Sanofi, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly)
are now offering $35-a-month caps or savings programs to only pay $35 for
out-of-pocket costs for insulin. They’re also cutting list prices for many of
their insulin products by 70% or more. This wouldn’t have been possible
without Congressional Democrats acting to cap the price of insulin in the
Inflation Reduction Act.
● After months of backlogs, the Passport Services have announced more
normal wait times for application processing. Routine service will now take
about 6-8 weeks and expedited service will take about 2-3 weeks.
●

Public Hearing
City Of Yes Economic Opportunity Proposal, hearing chaired by Paul Devlin.
● Catie Savage: A one-size fits-all approach to zoning is not appropriate for the diverse neighborhoods
that make up New York City. We are particularly concerned about the proposal to convert second floor
residential into commercial, as well as having 50% of apartment space to be used potentially for
business. While we're in the midst of a housing crisis, we can not risk an encroachment on our
dwindling housing stock by corporate enterprises.
● Tom Meany: there will be inadequate law enforcement to effectively enforce the rules of City
of Yes.
Mayor’s Preliminary Budget for Fiscal Year 2025, hearing chaired by Leslie Boghosian Murphy.
There were no speakers on this topic.

President Mark Levine’s has been extended to early March; please go to our web site to find out all
Office, presented by Yiyi of the information and to find the application.
Wang ● Some sidewalk sheds and scaffolding have remained in place for more than
5 years, which shouldn’t be allowed. We’ve recently given out “awards”
for the longest running sidewalk sheds, and two of them can be found in
MCD4. We have introduced legislation to address this problem.● The MBP will be celebrating Black History Month on February 20th at
Aaron Davis Hall with a celebration of 50 Years of Hip Hop. We hope to
see you there!
● Our office is providing free tax preparation help on Fridays from 9 to 5
through April 12. Appointments are strongly suggested. Please call 212-531

The deadline in Feb. 22 and there will be no extensions.
NY State Senator Brad ● Introduced new liaison to MCB4, Jonah Rose.
Hoylman-Siegel ● Very involved in hearings in Albany regarding the State budget. Believes
that NYC is not getting what it needs from the State in the budget.
Explained that NYC sends more tax dollars to Albany than it gets back.
● Introduced or partnered on several legislative initiatives, including:
○ preventing banks from charging fees when customers use EBT
cards
○ deterring the fencing of stolen goods online (e.g. Craigslist,
Facebook Marketplace)
○ expanding the number of hate crimes
○ allowing medical aid in dying
○ guaranteeing a right to representation in deportation proceedings
○ regulating e-bikes
● Pleased to report that Midtown Community Justice Center will resume
operations 5 days a week
NYC Council Member ● We are doing another cannabis study to provide updated data about the
Gale Brewer numbers of unlicensed shops selling cannabis. The proliferation is beyond
frustrating, and we have reached out to the Sheriff’s Office, the Health
Department and City Council to see what more can be done to shut them
down.
● I am very frustrated by the new rule that requires migrants to leave their
temporary homes after 60-days and re-apply for housing. This is terrible
for families with kids in schools especially. We are trying hard to ensure
that kids don’t lose their places in their current schools.
● The proposed budget cuts to the City’s budget are terrible.
NY State Senator Krueger, ● As Chair of the State Senate Finance Committee, Senator Krueger is
presented by Dana running all of the budget hearings that the Senate and Assembly are holding
Schmerzler in order to hear from State agencies and community organizations about
what they're going to use the money for, and also to advocate for the needs
and things that they want to see funded in this year's budget.
● Together with Senator Hoylman-Siegel, Senator Krueger has passed
legislation that would work to make sure that mopeds are being licensed
and sold correctly.
US Congress Member Dan ● In January, launched ‘NY-10 Alliance Against Gun Violence,’ a series of
Goldman, presented by events to highlight National Gun Violence Survivors week.
Tevin Williams ● Worked with fellow Democratic colleagues to oppose cuts to Social
Security proposed by Republicans.
NYC Public Advocate ● The How Many Stops Act and the bill about solitary confinement both
Jumaane Williams, passed in December, both of which should help protect and promote public
presented by Curtis Young safety and transparency.
● We are hosting a Black History Month celebration on Feb. 26, and you can
find more details on our web site.● We are continuing our monthly “Ask the Advocate” series on News2 – the
next segment for New Yorkers to call in and post direct questions to the
Public Advocate will be held on February 19th, as well as the same for the
Caribbean Power Hour radio call-in station, which will be on Feb 16th at 10
a.m.
NY State ● AM Rosenthal sent a letter to the Department of Education regarding the
Assemblymember Linda 60-day notices from H&H, which we know have been disruptive and
Rosenthal, presented by harmful for our Asylum Seekers. We asked specifically for an inter agency
Andres Rubiano communication system between the DOE and H&H, uniform notification
systems, alerting school districts about the 60-day notice and more
information from the DOE outlining all of the students legal right to return
to their local school upon moving.
● We were also very concerned about the report that recently came out about
the health code violations in some of our schools in our district, including
Ps11 and PS 245, among other smaller violations that were also reported.
We sent a letter to the Department of Education, outlining our concerns and
making sure that the trouble spots get rectified.

Reports From Elected Officials
NYC Council Member ● We had a big win with the indictment of Daniel Ohebshalom, named the
Erik Bottcher worst landlord in NYC. We worked hard to make sure that this slumlord
would be held accountable, and he is in Riker’s Island now.
● I am going to make sure that the approval process for any casino gaming
licenses in our District has utmost public input and that the Community
Board has to issue recommendations before the State review process even
starts. I look forward to partnering closely with Community Board 4 on
this issue
NYC Comptroller Brad ● The Comptroller’s Office is proud to have partnered with dozens of
Lander, presented by organizations to launch Homes Now, Homes for Generations—a city-
Evelin Collado focused affordable housing campaign for the Fiscal Year 2025 budget
cycle. The Homes Now, Homes for Generation campaign aims to quadruple
the City’s investment in affordable homeownership (through investing in
NYC Department of Housing & Preservation Development’s (HPD) Open
Door program) and make good on the City’s promise from 2018 to prevent
the displacement of tenants by preserving 7,000 rent-stabilized units
(through revitalizing HPD’s Neighborhood Pillars Program).
● Our office launched a new dashboard, Charting Homelessness in NYC,
which tracks New York City’s shelter population — broken down by
family type, age, and race, factors leading to homelessness like eviction
filings, and shelter exits with housing vouchers. The dashboard will
automatically update at regular intervals.
NY State ● We finally have a deal on the state budget and here are some highlights on
Assemblymember Tony housing. This deal, while by no means perfect, lays the groundwork to
Simone, presented by Ben begin addressing the housing emergency. We must increase supply, and this
Lowenstein deal will do that through a new Mitchell Lama program, incentives for
affordable housing development and office conversions and transforming
currently vacant state-owned sites into housing.
● The Assemblymember thanks MCB4 for its years of forward-thinking
leadership on housing issues.
● Our office is very pleased by the new enforcement mechanisms for illegal
cannabis shops.
● We are very pleased, after much advocacy, that Sammy’s Law was
included in the state budget. This law will allow New York City to lower
its speed limit to 20 miles per hour on nearly every road, which will reduce
the risk of death or life-threatening injury in a crash. The legislation was
named for Sammy Cohen Eckstein, a 12-year-old child who died in 2013
after he was hit by a driver in Brooklyn.US Congress member ● The Congressman introduced the Protecting Communities from Helicopter
Jerrold Nadler, presented Noise Act. This bill directs the FAA to study helicopter noise within a 15
by Hannah Wienerman mile radius of the Statue of Liberty and examine potential solutions for
diverting helicopters away from residential and recreational areas.
● The Congressman applauds the EEOC for finalizing the rule implementing
the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, a bill that he fought for years to get
passed, which includes abortion in its definition of employer
accommodations required for “pregnancy, child birth or related medical
conditions.”
● We joined the chorus of local elected officials in condemning the appalling
resolution 248 passed by the Community Education Council District 2 that
targets transgender girls in sports. Our trans students have the same right to
participate in sports like all other students.
NYC Mayor Eric Adam’s ● New York City public schools will implement a curriculum designed to
Office, presented by Robin teach students in grades 6-12 about hate crimes and bias incidents and their
Forst impact on individuals and communities. The curriculum titled 'Teaching
About Hate Crimes and their Impacts' includes five lessons on diversity,
critical thinking, and civic engagement. Students will learn to identify
motives and behaviors that cause hate crimes, examine the impacts of
current hate crime trends on communities and design initiatives that
promote inclusion and collective action.
● The Mayor recently launched the public review period for the City of Yes
Housing Opportunity. We are looking to create a little more housing in
every neighborhood in the city with carefully created zoning changes, and
hopefully this will alleviate the housing crunch and build a more hospitable,
habitable City.
Board Reports & Business
Adoption of Agenda and The Agenda was adopted unanimously. The April Full Board Minutes were
Minutes adopted unanimously.
District Manager Report ● MCB4 Hybrid Meeting Policy remains in effect with no changes.
● Arts, Culture, Education, and Schools Committee will be meeting on
Monday, May 6th rather than the 2nd Monday of the month.
● The Executive Committee will meet on Tuesday, May 28th.
● All other Committees are meeting on their regular scheduled dates and
times
Chair’s Report ● Thanks to Jesse, our District Manager, for all of his hardworking
contributions, especially for arranging tonight’s translation services for the
public session.
● The State has concluded its budget process, and we will be unpacking what
that means for our District in the next several weeks, so let’s put a pin in
that.
● The Port Authority Bus Terminal Working Group has been meeting
regularly for a long time, and now the plan is on an expedited timeline to
ensure the availability of federal financing. We are hopeful that the PortAuthority will be coming to the June meeting of the Chelsea/Hell’s Kitchen
Land Use Committee for the ULURP.
● The Department of City Planning is presenting tomorrow (May 2) to the
HHHS Committee about the City of Yes Housing Opportunity, so please
attend if possible to provide your feedback.
● Hudson River Trust is beginning the process for the redesign of the
esplanade. We expect them to present to WPE soon.
● We’ve adopted a monthly meeting schedule to advance the discussions of
the NYCHA Proposal, and we continue to meet monthly.
● As we heard from City Councilmember Bottcher, the Citywide Casino Text
Amendment passed, and we look forward to hearing from him how MCB4
will stay actively involved in any approval processes.
● The Vessel will be re-opening with increased safety measures. We’ve
heard that they plan to charge for admission, which is contradictory to the
original proposed use of the space, so we hope to have further input on this
change before it is finalized. There is no date yet for the re-opening.
● We expect to receive the names of the new MCB4 members before the end
of the month.

Reports From Elected Officials
Manhattan Borough ● happy to report that we had a vote at our Borough Board meeting earlier
President Mark Levine, this month on the City of Yes Text Amendment and it passed. The BP also
presented by Yiyi Wang issued his own recommendations on ways to strengthen supportive housing
in the COY.
● Several upcoming special events: after-hour tour of the Whitney Museum
on July 25; NYCHA Connect Series, starting on July 29; and a Dominican
Heritage Event on Aug. 1
US Congressman Jerrold ● Earlier this week, Congress passed the Water Resources Development Act
Nadler, presented by of 2024, which includes Congressman Nadler’s request to authorize $60
Hannah Wienerman million to the Army Corps of Engineers to work with the city of New York
in upgrading Manhattan's environmental infrastructure.
● Earlier this month, Congressman Nadler joined his New York and New
Jersey colleagues in announcing $6.88 billion dollar in federal DOT
funding to jump start the construction of the Gateway Tunnel.
● And because it wasn’t our turn to address you last month, I just want to
reiterate Congressman Nadler’s strong disappointment in GovernorHochul’s announcement to delay the implementation of congestion pricing
which we need now more than ever to reduce paralyzing vehicle traffic,
improve air quality, and raise desperately needed capital funds to enhance
the public transit system that millions depend on. He also delivered a
statement in support of congestion pricing at June’s MTA Board Meeting.
New York State ● Representative Simone appreciates all of the well wishes after his ruptured
Representative Tony appendix was removed yesterday.
Simone, presented by Matt ● The Representative recently introduced A1660, which will increase the
Tighe penalties for reckless driving that results in the injury or death of a pet. It
also increases the fines for leaving the scene of an injury to an animal
without reporting it.
● School supply donations can be dropped off at our office until Aug. 20.
NYC Mayor Eric ● Operation Padlock has successfully launched, which allows the sheriff’s
Adams, presented by office to padlock illegal cannabis shops. To date, there have been 639 shops
Robin Forst that are padlocked with 32,000 plus counts violations, and the amount of
drugs seized, is $51 million. There's a lot more to do, but it's a great start.
● Our office is very focused on the safe storage and use of e-bikes. For
example, the DOT is going to launch the nation's first municipal trade-in
pilot program for unsafe e-bikes and other powered mobility devices
allowing eligible food delivery workers to replace their unsafe devices with
safe and legal bikes.
NYC Councilmember Erik ● We need more assistance from the City to address mental health crises of
Bottcher, presented by homeless residents in our District. We also have legislation that would
Jordan Feiner place more social workers in our police precincts.
● We are more than halfway to our goal of planting 1,000 trees in Council
District 3 – we have already planted 504 trees. Huge thanks to the Parks
Department!

Reports From Elected Officials
NYS Senator Brad ● Sorry to hear that Jeffrey LeFrancois is stepping down from MCB4
Hoylman-Sigal but certain he will continue to be very involved with the community.
● Participated today in a press conference to object to the Mayor’s
policy of limiting the stay of migrants to 60 days in any specific
shelter before leaving and starting the process again. Very disruptive
to families with children in school. Also introduced legislation at the
state level that would preclude the Mayor from implementing this
policy.
● Gov. Hochul recently signed our bill that requires all gasoline-
powered mopeds to get licensed with the State Dept. of
Transportation before leaving the store where the bike is purchased.
This should help law enforcement be able to find bikes that are
accused of breaking the law.
● Gov. Hochul also just signed our bill to appoint more Family Court
judges, which are critically needed.
● I am hosting a Town Hall on Sept. 15 at the Natural Museum of
History. Please come!
Manhattan Borough ● Ghost cars (those with defaced, obstructed, and fraudulent license
President Mark Levine, plates) pose a huge problem for law enforcement and the city. Our
presented by Yiyi Wang office is working to ensure that every vehicle has a valid and readable
license plate.
● During the week of Oct. 28-Nov. 2, we will be hosting again our
Leadership Training Series for new members of the Community
Board and any other Board members who haven’t received the
training.NYS Senator Liz ● On Sept. 12, from 10 - 11:30 am, we will be hosting one of our
Krueger, presented by Roundtables. This one will be focused on new technology designed
Dana Schmerzler with older adults in mind.
● On Oct. 1, we will be hosting a clinic on “Benefits for Older Adults”.
You can learn about rent freeze, heat, healthcare benefits available
for older adults.
District Attorney Alvin ● There has been a rise in anti-semitic incidents in the last year, so our
Bragg, presented by Eric office is doing quite a bit of outreach to Jewish community leaders.
Strazza
● We have hosted several Art of Healing Festivals, and our next one
will be on the Lower East side after the violent incident at Tompkins
Square Park.
● Our office web site is a great resource to learn details about all of the
indictments and sentences that have been issued recently.
●

Park-Rogers trillion over ten years to raise funds to address the effects of the
climate change crisis.

● He also recently introduced the Continued Costs of the Sept. 11th
Terrorist Attacks Act to safeguard the FDNY and NYPD pension
plans.
NYS Assemblymember ● We encourage everyone to get flu and COVID vaccinations this
Tony Simone, presented winter. Check our website for dates that vaccines will be offered in
by Ben Lowenstein our office.● Our office is also hosting a winter clothing drive and a paper-
shredding event. Check our website for details.
● The Assemblymember will be re-introducing a bill of his to reform
the process on how City Charter propositions get on the ballot under
current law. Currently, if a mayor forms a City Charter Commission
then the Commission's proposals automatically bump any other local
referendum proposals off the ballot, including any proposed by the
City Council. This allows a mayor to propose even minor changes to
the City Charter as a method of blocking significant City Council
proposals.The most recent Charter commission was criticized for a
rushed process and lack of transparency.
NYC Mayor Eric ● There will be a third issuance of bonds devoted to affordable
Adams, presented by housing. This issuance is intended to help develop 4,300 more units
Robin Forst of affordable housing.
● The Mayor has launched a Ghost Car Task Force, which combines
the efforts of NYPD and Sanitation and is designed to get rid of
“ghost cars” (cars that have forged or altered license plates). In the
first 5 days of the program, they were able to remove more than 300
ghost cars from the streets of NYC!
● The City is entering the last phase of the 20+ year infrastructure
program to protect the City’s drinking water. This phase is aimed at
preventing the problem of millions of gallons of drinking water
leaking into the ground.
NYC Councilmember ● I wrote a letter to Mayor Adams, urging him to bring the Behavioral
Erik Bottcher Health Emergency Assistance Response Division (B-HEARD) into
all the precincts covering my council district, including this one. The
pilot program, which launched in 2021, sends FDNY paramedics and
emergency technicians and mental health clinicians instead of police
officers to 911 calls involving mental health crises. In our District, it
is the police who respond to 911 calls involving mental health crises.
The B-HEARD program in is 31 out of 77 precincts, and none are in
Council District 3. I would like MCB4’s help in highlighting the need
for B-HEARD in our precincts and advocating for it.
● We had a big victory this week regarding the General Theological
Seminary. They faced huge financial difficulties and were about to
sign a 100-year lease with a conservative Catholic group whose
values don’t align with those of our community. My office and lots
of others got involved and now GTS is doing a partnership with
Vanderbilt University instead.
NYC Comptroller Brad ● The Comptroller has released two new dashboards to provide
Lander, presented by important data to NYC residents. Both can be accessed on the
Evelin Collado Comptroller’s web site:
○ The Employer Violations Dashboard is the first-ever
transparency and accountability tool to track and analyze
workplace violations in the five boroughs across federal,
state, and city government enforcement agencies.○ the Measuring NYC Government Performance dashboard
indicates whether various agencies’ performance improved,
declined, or stayed steady, using easy-to-read, color-coded
graphics, and data-backed indicators. Provides data about
DHS, NYPD, FDNY, Dept. of Corrections, Sanitation, etc.

Presentation

Delorse Rubin are invited to attend.
Brian Webber ● Topics may include security, drug enforcement, homeless encampments,
and various community concerns.
● Sector meetings are divided by geographic locations.
Public Hearing
Annual District Needs and Budget Requests
● No members from the public signed up to speak.
Roberta BarnettPublic Session
● For reference, to remind the public that the NYCHA Board of Director and
HUD approved the demolition of both NYCHA housing campuses
Mike Noble
recently. That meeting is available on their YouTube channel, at the 56
minute mark and includes timeline and details of the project.
● Representative from the Korean Community Services.
● Addressed that fast food and sugar is attributing to death and diabetes in
Emily Li children that are targeted by fast food restaurants in low income areas.
● Asks the community to support Intro 06421 by calling their city council
representatives.

Jason Ginburg FreshDirect trucks blocking the street access and sidewalk.

Alexia Cruz
● Upset that elected officials are not responding to end demolition.

● Addresses the election outcome and reminds the community to stay

Jesse Greenwald

Reports From Elected Officials
NYS Senator Brad ● I am grateful and honored to have been re-elected last night with the
Hoylman-Sigal most votes of any Democratic senator who ran for re-election last
night.
● Congestion pricing must be implemented. We can not let this crucial
funding disappear.
● Route 9A needs to be improved, and my colleagues and I have urged
the state to make the critical improvements. Unlike the East side
which has a storm resiliency plan in place, there isn’t such a plan for
the west side corridor that runs along the Hudson.
● I am very proud of my Glock Switch Bill, which the Governor
signed. It is the first of its kind in the nation. It requires gun
manufacturers to make certain that their devices aren't compatible
with machine gun conversion devices.
● The Board of NYCHA voted to approve the agreement to proceed
with the redevelopment of the campuses. There is not nearly enoughmoney available in the City or State budgets to do the repairs so we
need innovative solutions like this to address the awful conditions.
We will continue to focus on ensuring that the tenants are protected
in every way possible.
NYS Assemblymember ● I am grateful to be re-elected last night and grateful to be the
Linda Rosenthal Assemblymember in Manhattan who received the most votes.
● One area of deep concern is Trump’s plan to create a national
abortion database. I have a bill, the NY Privacy Act, that will protect
the privacy of sensitive health data. Most people don’t know that if
they use an app to track any health issues (e.g. a period tracker) their
data isn’t protected right now. We need to change that.
● Project 2025 talked about eliminating HUD. My proposed bill to
create housing access vouchers is more important than ever, and has
lots of support across housing interests.
● I am working to get better reimbursement rates for health clinics
across the city. Ryan Chelsea Health Clinic, like many other
indispensable clinics, is under considerable strain right now.
Manhattan Borough ● The MBP’s office is proud to release a new Senior Resource Guide to
President Mark Levine, help ensure that New Yorkers can age in place and live independent
presented by Yiyi Wang lives in the community where they belong. This 50+ page
comprehensive guide is designed to help seniors and their families
navigate the services and programs available across all 12 of
Manhattan's Community districts such as senior centers, health and
nutrition, transportation, housing and legal assistance.
● For the second year in a row, we are excited to open applications for
our Manhattan Future Leaders Fellowship, designed specifically for
high school juniors and seniors. The deadline to apply is Dec. 1.
NYS Senator Liz ● Senator Krueger is very happy that Proposition 1 regarding the ERA
Krueger, presented by was passed yesterday in the election.
Dana Schmerzler ● A big priority is getting congestion pricing passed.
● We are hosting several events in the coming weeks, including talks
about Medicare, how to protect yourself against scammers, and a 4-
part series about housing. Please see our web site for details.
NYC Mayor Eric ● No formal presentation this month but happy to answer any
Adams, presented by questions.

Agency Update: Department of Parks and Recreation Trial Dog Run at Penn South Playground at West 25
Street (8/9 Aves)
Terese Flores from the NYC Parks Department presented.
The Parks Department created a dog run, on a trial basis, at Penn South in April, 2022. This trial was in
response to a temporary closure of the nearby Chelsea Waterfront Dog Run and a closure at Dewitt Clinton for
resurfacing. Since the Penn South dog run opened, we've received numerous complaints regarding the location
due to disruptive noise levels that are impacting nearby residents.
We understand that there's a resolution being voted on today with regard to the Penn South dog run, and we
look forward to hearing the results of that vote and reviewing the resolution with you.
Should this board vote to support the closure of the Penn South dog run, we will welcome input as to other
options. For example, someone suggested that Chelsea Park handball courts be turned into a dog run. This site
has been identified as an underutilized space and we think it's a location that would mitigate some of the
concerns regarding noise levels in residential areas and we'd like to explore the possibility of converting a
portion of the handball court into a dog run. We value the thoughts and the input in this process, and we hope
to explore this idea and other ideas about the sites such as pickleball courts, for a potential win-win solution that
can be discussed at the next CB4 Parks Committee Meeting, which is on January 12th.
Ultimately, the Parks Department wants to be responsive to the needs and concerns of the community, and we
want to both actively listen to these concerns and be proactive about identifying potential solutions.
Presentation and Public Hearing: NYS Upcoming Request for Proposal for the Bayview Building at 550
West 20th Street
CLU/HHHS Committee Co-Chairs Joe Restuccia (HHHS) and Jessica Chait (CLU) opened a public hearing
regarding the Bayview Building at 550 W20th St. Joe presented a detailed powerpoint presentation. See
attached.
The 3 key components of the proposal for the Bayview Building are as follows:
1. Affordable Housing
a. 115 units of permanently affordable housing
b. 30 beds for psychiatric residential housingc. No market-rate units at the site
2. Community Center
a. Swimming pool, basketball courts, etc., for people to use who live in the neighborhood
3. Historic preservation of the key components of the building
In January, both Chelsea Land Use and HHHS committees will have more public discussions about this
proposal, and then the Board will work in February with its local elected officials to discuss the terms for the
RFP for this site.
Public Hearing Speakers
Ms. Rivera spoke in favor of the proposal. It will be really great for the youth to have a
Marilyn Rivera
community center.
Mr. Acevedo spoke in favor of the proposal. He pointed out that there is no gym or
community space at Fulton House, so the community center at Bayview Chelsea would be
Miguel Acevedo
a great thing for Fulton House residents. He also suggested that work-force development
could happen in the industrial kitchen.
Mr. Holowka spoke as a representative of Save Chelsea. He asked that the terra cotta be
David Holowka
preserved as part of the historic preservation.
Ms. Wolff is very supportive of the Bayview Chelsea project. She suggested that MCB4
Pamela Wolff
do more to publicize the opportunities for public input on this project.
Public Session Speakers
Ms Rosen said that the Board should not approve the letter written by WPE, which she
believes was written in bad faith and does not represent the views of the community. She
said that elderly and disabled residents need the dog park to remain at Penn South as they
Shelli Rosen
are unable to walk to the dog runs at Waterside Park and Madison Square Park. Ms Rosen
also criticized the WPE for not acknowledging the sheer number of supporters of the dog
park at Penn South.
Ms. Regal is a resident of Penn South and she overlooks the dog run. She said that the
noise from the dog park is horrendous and that it was a ludicrous idea to create a dog run
Rosalie Regal in the middle of Penn South. She said that she is not able to read or write given how
horrible the noise is from the dog park, and that she wants it gone as soon as possible. She
is glad that WPE recommends closing the dog park.
Ms. Walitt is a resident of Penn South who faces the dog park, and she thanks the WPE
Committee for voting to recommend closing the dog park and for supporting efforts to
Susan Walitt find an alternative location for the dog run. Please approve the committee's draft letter
recommending the dog park be closed now and find a more appropriate nearby location
that is not in the middle of a residential complex.
Ms. Ramer lives in Penn South facing the dog park. She said that she represents over 100
Penn South residents and all the nuns of Saint Columbus. Ms. Ramer said that she and the
people she represents are directly impacted by the noise of the dog run and want the Penn
South dog park closed as promised now that the Chelsea Waterpark site has reopened.
She has gathered over one hundred signatures on a petition to close the dog park, and her
Deborah Ramer petition is verifiable according to WPE guidelines and includes names addresses and
signatures of Penn South residents. The people who signed the petition told her about the
loud barking which awakened them every morning, of not being able to work or
concentrate at home because of the noise, and of being deprived of the peaceful enjoyment
of their homes. So many of our residents are elderly and have no idea who to complain to
or how to complain. She also said that many of the elderly residents who have dogs don’tuse the dog park as they're afraid of being knocked over or having their dogs trampled by
the other dogs that are wildly running around.
Ms. Mullaney fully supported this dog run when it was presented as a temporary solution
until the other dog run was completed. As a resident of Penn South who faces this park,
her quality of life has been negatively impacted daily. This location is not situated where
barking from dogs can dissipate. It is nestled between two buildings and the noise has
Rita Mullaney
nowhere to go but up. Please consider who is complaining and where we live. We are not
anti-dog people; I support dog runs, but not in the backyards of our homes. We live here;
we're not asking for anything more than what we all want and deserve in our homes, and
that is a peaceful place to live, which we do not have anymore.
Ms. Kelly started by saying that the presentation on Bayview at the beginning of the
meeting was great. Ms. Kelly also lives in Penn South, and she supports the WPE letter
recommending the closure of the dog run. She said that the barking often goes on
Margaret Kelly
incessantly, which really affects our quality of life. We also have a power station here and
no one has mentioned that we listen to the power station all summer long. Between the
barking and the power station, the noise is horrific
Ms. Ivchenko asked that the Board advocate for the removal of the barricades on 22nd
Street between 7th and 8th avenues until a study has been done by DOT. Not for the first
time, fire engines had a problem getting through last weekend. The firefighters had to
jump out of the truck, throw the barricades through the air onto the sidewalk, and then
Inge Ivchenko
jump back on the truck. The truck still had a hard time coming around the planters that
have been placed on the corners. The fire truck barely fit through. Also, there are people
that have been trying to join the Block Association since 2019 and their applications
haven’t been entertained.
Mr. Lunke thanked CB4, especially the Transportation Planning Committee, for its
support of the West 22nd Open Street Community Visioning Workshop and final report.
Mr. Lunke said that the findings and suggestions have expanded the discussion on how to
remake our public streets into relaxing and experiential open space. The more streets we
Tom Lunke have dedicated to neighborhood strolling and socializing, the stronger our local health and
economy will be. Thank you to Councilman Eric Botcher, Jordan Feiner, and the fire,
police, sanitation and delivery workers for continuing to support our efforts. Finally, a
special thank you to all the participants and volunteers of the workshop, whose input
helped shape our 114 page Visionary Report.
Mr. Vangelatos is Center Manager at the Chelsea Recreation Center. He announced three
events this month that will be free and open to the public. The first one is this Sunday,
January 8th from 3 to 5 p.m. We're hosting a clinic led by the New York Knicks staff,
with an appearance from a special guest. This Knicks event is open for youth ages 7 to 17,
and they will have the chance to work on drills and learn different fundamentals of
Bobby Vangelatos basketball. The other two events are for adults. On Friday, January 13th from 5:30 to 7:30
p.m, we will be hosting a glow-in-the-dark pickleball event. Pickleball is fun all the time,
but it's even better when it's under the lights and in neon colors! On the same theme, on
Friday January 27th from 6 to 7:30 pm, we're going to have a glow-in-the-dark fitness
circuit event. We're going to do circuit training at various fitness stations and then a spin
bike session as well.
Mr. Baum works for the Parks Department and lives at Penn South. He said that the noise
from the dog run is unescapable, and that it is similar to “death by a thousand paper cuts .”
He also said that the dog run is very different from the dog runs located in parks and
Steven Baum
overseen by the Parks Department as it has no water and no irrigation. He also pointed out
that only a handful of dog runs managed by the Parks Department are concrete like the
one at Penn South.
Ms. Harris wants the “Open Streets” barricades removed on West 22nd Street. She
Molly Harris
thanked MCB4 for addressing the Urgent concerns of 250 of her neighbors, who signed apetition asking for the barriers to be taken away and equal access to the street be returned.
Ms Harris supports a compromise of limited hours when the barricades would go up to
create a more limited “Open Street.”
Mr. Schwartz is an architect and urban designer who has lived on 22nd Street for over 30
years. He opposes the current barricade system on 22nd Street. Instead, he supports
research that could identify a shared-street program that benefits the entire neighborhood,
Aaron Schwartz
not just a single block. He thinks that a holistic, community-analysis should be designed
by professionals who know about the best interests of sharing streets between pedestrians
and vehicles. He also believes that the barriers should be removed immediately.
Ms. Wolff said that the Chelsea West 200 Block Association has been in existence since
1976. It had its ups and downs, but it has survived through all of that with a very healthy
list of members. Ms. Wolff reaches out frequently to the members to share information
Pamela Wolff
and tell them about events in the community. Ms. Wolff also said that she agrees with the
suggestion that there should be a comprehensive study done of the vehicular, pedestrian
and safety needs connected with the Open Street on West 22nd St.
It's been a really exciting time for public space in Chelsea and it's been great to coalesce
with the community on a project that speaks to the future of the city as a whole. We look
forward to working with the D.O.T on funding for programming and implementation of
options A and B that came out of the report from our October Community Visioning
Workshop. These alternatives offer both traffic calming, more greenery and obviate the
Melodie Bryant
need for barricades on our Open Street, and so these are redesigns that our Workshop
showed will be welcomed by the community at large. We're energized to take this
promising vision forward. I'd like to thank our dedicated volunteers on the ground and
thanks also to Checkpeds, our sponsors and retailers, and especially for the support of
MCB4.
Mr. Friedman is a huge supporter of the 22nd Street Open Street. He supports the
redesign, and more greenery, and the slow speeds. He has heard people say that the Open
Barak Friedman
Street design is dangerous, but he doesn’t think there is data to support that claim. He
would like to see the data if it exists.
Ms. Fisher asked about following up on traffic safety issues raised in a letter by CB4 to
DOT in March about traffic lights on 8th and 9th Avenues. The heads of the
Miriam Fisher
Transportation Committee indicated that they would follow up by email and at the next
committee meeting.
Mr. Hyatt supports exploring new alternatives for the Open Street on West 22nd Street. He
hopes that rethinking the design can happen quickly, without excessive analysis. He said
Andrew Hyatt
that the sidewalks of Chelsea are some of the worst to walk on in general, and that Chelsea
needs to do a better job of rethinking the streets.
Mr. Kennedy works near West 22nd Street and he likes having the Open Street. He
Dylan Kennedy
supports options A and B from the Community Visioning Workshop.
Ms. Rivera lives at Penn South and she opposes the dog run. She said that the noise at
the dog run is horrific, and that she is grateful to MCB4 for listening to everyone’s
Marilyn Rivera
concerns.
Mr. Taylor is a 43-year resident of West 20th Street. He opposes the Open Street on West
22nd Street as currently configured. He noted that with West 22nd Street barricaded, there
are only two eastbound streets between 14th Street and 26th Street that are not restricted,
Albert Taylor so the traffic that would have gone across 22nd Street gets pushed to 20th Street, which
isn’t fair to 20th street residents. Mr. Taylor supports MCB4’s draft letter (item 14) about
the Open Street, but requests that MCB4 consider amending the paragraph at lines 36 and
37, to request that a solution that is not only “equitable” for all street users, but alsoequitable for the residents of the neighboring streets who are threatened with increased
traffic.
Ms. Andre lives on West 20th Street and she opposes the Open Street on West 22nd Street.
She says that her block on West 20th Street now has far more traffic than before West 20th
Lydia Andre Street was barricaded for its Open Street. She believes West 22nd Street shouldn’t be
barricaded to traffic until there is much more research and data about the impact of such
closure on surrounding streets.
Mr. Marans is part of the Block Association of 47th/48th Streets, and is alarmed by the
number of people who ride bikes on sidewalks. His Block Association is working with
Richard Marans
other Block Associations to try to mobilize about this safety issue,and will work closely
with the Transportation Committee to seek a resolution to this dangerous practice.
Mr. Burke said that he loves the Open Street on West 22nd Street, and he thinks that there
Jim Burke should probably be more Open Streets. He is also grateful for the volunteers who have
made this a reality.
Mr. Neuhaus thanked the Transportation Planning Committee for its thoughtful attempt to
address an interim solution concerning the Open Street on West 22nd Street. As for the
letter to the DOT, the letter endorses choosing West 22nd Street as a street to run this
Joe Neuhaus experiment, and that seems to me to be premature. I urge the community board to take a
more neutral stance with respect to the choice of a block to choose. He agrees with the
previous remarks by the two residents of 20th Street about the unfair traffic increase on
nearby streets.
Ms. Wager is Director of Government and Community Relations at the Fashion Institute
Lisa Wager of Technology (FIT). She was home sick, but didn’t want to miss a meeting. She
promises to be back next month to provide updates on FIT.
Ms. Sossa lives at Penn South facing the dog run on 25th Street and opposes the dog run.
She thanked the WPE Committee and NYC Parks Department for hearing the concerns of
Lyudmyla Sossa the residents and recommending the closure of the dog run. She said that the incessant
barking and fighting among the dogs greatly impacts the quality of life for nearby
residents.
Ms. Van Dyke is the Producing Artistic Director of New Federal Theater (NFT). We
reside at 543 West 42nd Street, where we produce plays and have been doing so for
over 53 years. Our space is up for sale and in negotiation. So we are in need of a
Elizabeth VanDyke
performing arts space and theater offices. Tonight, you will be voting on a letter drafted
by the ACES committee, and I am just humbly asking you to support us in our effort.
Art is vital. Art is healing. Thank you for your help.

Public Hearing: Mayor’s Preliminary Budget for Fiscal Year 2024
MCB4 Budget Task Force Chair Leslie Boghosian-Murphy opened a public hearing regarding the Mayor’s
preliminary budget for FY 2024. She explained the process for preparing the Community Board’s Statement of
District Needs, and explained the letter that will be voted on later this evening, which is the Community
Board’s response to the Mayor’s budget as it relates to the Statement of District Needs. There were no speakers
from the public about this issue, so the hearing was closed.
Public Hearing: MCB4 Comments on New York State Office of Cannabis Management
Regulations for Adult Use of Cannabis
Jesse Greenwald, Chair of the MCB4 Cannabis Working Group, opened the public hearing to get the public’s
input on the MCB4 letter to the NYS Office of Cannabis Management (OCM) (Item 25) regarding the proposed
regulations for cannabis adult use, retail dispensaries and on-site consumption lounges. No one from the public
signed up to speak on this topic so the public hearing was closed.

Remarks from Elected Officials and RepresentativesTony Simone, ● Affordable Housing:
State ○ we need to become builders and creators of housing – not just for low
Assemblymember income but for the middle class working folks, so they can live and work in
our district.
○ we also need to make sure that the tenants that already live here are
protected, which is why I am fighting for good cause eviction and other
protective measures.
● Penn Station:
○ The current plan is unacceptable. It is a development plan but I'm fighting
for it to be an infrastructure transportation plan.
○ The current plan is too reliant on private development.
○ We don’t need 10 new office towers by Penn Station.
● Casinos
○ I am philosophically opposed to a casino in Manhattan, so I will view any
and all plans with skepticism.
Olivia Glen- ● Congressman Nadler’s office is continuing to learn and connect with constituents ●
Rayner, Office of and organizations in our new district (NY-12). At the same time, we are helping
Congressmember new elected officials transition into parts of our old district.
Jerrold Nadler ● Congressman Nadler has been active in his new role as Ranking Member of the
House Judiciary Committee. In DC this week, he has been working hard to
constitute the Committee which includes naming Representatives to the Committee
and assigning appropriate Sub-Committees.
● Now that Democrats are in the minority in the House, Congressman Nadler is using
his voice to stand up against Republican overreach. He is fervently advocating
against Republican attempts to cut social security and Medicare and their crusade
to pass a national abortion ban.
● The Congressmember joined City and State Elected Officials from the East Side in
expressing concern to the NYC Landmarks Preservation Committee on the
placement of 5G towers throughout NY-12.
● Constituents can reach out to Olivia Glen-Rayner (Olivia.Glen-
Rayner@mail.house.gov) with any concerns.
Robin Frost, ● I joined the Mayor’s Office last month.
Mayor’s Office of ● I understand that there are a lot of questions about the single adult asylum seekers
Community who have been moved from the Watson Hotel to the Cruise Ship Terminal in
Affairs Brooklyn; and about the families of asylum seekers that will be moving into the
Watson Hotel.
● As of today, there are about 600 people who have been moved from the Watson
Hotel to the Cruise Ship Terminal. There are still a couple of hundred people to be
moved out of the Watson Hotel. For asylum seekers who have relatives or other
connection with whom they can live, the City is being very diligent to provide
transportation, including plane tickets, to help people relocate while they are
waiting for the asylum applications.
● As for the conditions at the Cruise Terminal, there are bathrooms for every 15
people (a City standard), and lots of showers. There are busses running for free
every hour to Barclays Center for people to access the subways, and the ferry is
next to the Cruise Terminal and also convenient.
● Going forward, the Watson Hotel has been earmarked to provide housing to
families of asylum seekers – not single adults. We have a great need for housing
for families.
Eric Bottcher, City ● I visited today the Brooklyn Cruise Ship Terminal where hundreds of single adult
Councilmember asylum seekers were moved from the Watson Hotel. The Terminal is only a
temporary site (only for 12 weeks) because it will be a cruise terminal again whenthe cruising season starts. I continue to be impressed by the way that NY Health
and Hospitals run their sites.
● Every elementary school in our District has enrolled students whose families are
seeking asylum, but there are still shortages of Spanish-speaking staff. The schools
have the money to hire, but Spanish-speaking educators are in short supply.
● We had a hearing recently on my resolution calling on the Department of
Education to implement and fulfill its obligation to offer bike education classes in
all schools, as they are required to by state law.
● The Mayor signed our legislation regarding single-use plastics. As a result, when
anyone orders takeout, they will have to proactively check the box in order to have
plastic cutlery included in their order.
Mark Levine, ● It was great to see so many of you last night in the crowd of more than 500 people
Manhattan who attended the annual State of the Borough presentation.
Borough President ● Little known fact: Manhattan's population is up almost four percent compared to
pre-pandemic.
● We must build more affordable housing, and we have identified 171 properties in
Manhattan where such housing can be built. Many are owned by the City or by
City agencies.
● We have a really successful, multi-agency, coordinated effort on 125th Street that
we believe could serve as a model to address some of the safety concerns in Hell's
Kitchen. This effort on the eastern part of 125th street has brought together the
local police precinct, the Department of Homeless Services, the Department of
Health and Mental Hygiene, the DOT, the Parks Department, and the District
Attorney's office. It has been incredibly effective at making that part of 125th
Street, safer, healthier, greener than it's been in years. I am calling for this multi-
agency model to be replicated in Hell's Kitchen, because you face some of the same
problems that we've been seeing on 125th and actually I've been speaking this week
to DA Alvin Bragg, who was also extremely supportive of implementing this.
● We are working to create a Waterfront Protection Agency to address waterfront
resiliency issues.
● Another climate resiliency measure we are supporting as a way to fight climate
change is the planting of a million more trees in NYC. We are asking Community
Boards to pass resolutions to support this tree planting goal. I hope that MCB4 will
provide such a resolution!
● My office is also focused on composting. We want every single residential
building in Manhattan to have composting pick-up. While that will take time to
become a reality, I hope to see more of the orange composting bins that are on
sidewalks in other neighborhoods come to CB4. They are locked and can be
accessed with an app on your phone so that you can put your composting in them.

Remarks from Elected Officials and Representatives
Yiyi Wang, from ● Invited the community to march with the MBP’s office in the Puerto Rican
Manhattan Borough Day Parade on June 11th and the Pride Parade on June 25th.
President Mark Levine’s ● Thanked outgoing MCB4 members who are stepping down from the
Office Community Board, and welcomed the new members who have been
appointed.
● Our office strongly opposes any rent hikes on rent stabilized apartments and
will continue to fight for New Yorkers who are still feeling the impact of
last year’s rent hikes on rent stabilized apartments.
● We want to hear from New Yorkers about their views on artificial
intelligence. AI may have profound implications for New York City, our
economy, workers, schools, local elections, the city government operations
and more so our city needs to be mobilize to meet this moment. What do
you see as the potential benefits and threats from AI? Share your views
online at:www.manhattanbp.nyc.gov/initiatives/ainyc/
● The deadline for applying to serve on a Community Education Council has
been extended to June 9.● Re: MSG special permits, the MBP’s office recommends 5 year term limits
on any such permits, and also is pushing for plans to have the theater
repurposed.
Olivia Glen-Rayner, from ● Our office continues to work to increase funding for NYCHA and to fast
Congress Member Jerrold track work permits for asylum seekers.
Nadler’s Office ● Recently re-introduced the Disaster Assistance Equity Act in the hopes that
FEMA will treat all homeowners the same after a natural disaster.
Presently, FEMA’s eligibility rules exclude homeowners who live in co-ops,
homeowners’ associations, etc.
● Also working to end non-essential helicopter flights in NYC.
● We encourage everyone to come march with us in the Pride Parade on June
25th.
Evelin Collado, from ● Our office is proud to plug our newly released 2023 edition of the New
Comptroller Brad Lander’s York City LGBTQ+ Resource Guide—a citywide directory of organizations
office and services for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and Gender
Non-Conforming New Yorkers. The Guide lists over 200 organizations that
provide services by or for members of these communities, from healthcare
to senior services, access to housing, the arts, and youth support. Our office
updates this Guide every year so we have the most comprehensive Citywide
directory of resources for LGBTQ+ communities.
Assembly Member Tony ● Legislation to protect our climate is a key priority of ours as we are decades
Simone behind in fighting the climate crisis.
● I just passed the bill in the State Assembly that adds gender identity and
expression as a protected class to the anti-discrimination protection for
interns under the Human Rights law.
● I will soon be introducing legislation to address the problem of e-bikes not
following the rules (e.g. riding on the sidewalks). The bill will require
e-bikes used for commercial purposes to be registered and brandish a
license plate. It also redirects all fines to the employer, who often pressures
our delivery workers to deliver food in 10-15 minutes. People can wait
longer for deliveries.
● Earlier this month, I introduced a bill to remove the heliport from the
Hudson River Park (A7277) and another bill (6985) to prohibit
municipalities from allowing public lands for helicopters for sightseeing
tours or photography. Both of these bills are carried by State Senator
Hoylman Siegel on the Senate side.
● I have been hounding the Cannabis management office about their lack of
enforcement.
Jordan Feiner, from ● On May 23rd, we met outside of 128 West 17th Street, also known as the
Council Member Erik Former Colored School Number Four, with community members, CB4
Bottcher’s office members and local historian, Eric K Washington, as well as the Mayor of
New York City, as we announced that the Councilmember had secured $6
million in funding for this historic building to help restore it! On that same
day, the Landmarks Preservation Commission voted to designate the former
school as an historic landmark. Thanks to MCB4, including Kerry, Jessica
and the other members of Chelsea Land Use who fought hard for this.
● We recently concluded our participatory budgeting process and announced
the winners. We were very pleased that 3,333 people voted on which
projects should win, which is a 50% increase over the number of voters last
time. Out of the 31 City Council members who did participatory budgeting,
our Council District got the fifth highest participation rate, so we are very
pleased with the team effort.● We are pleased to announce 200+ trees that will be planted soon in the
District, which means that we are well on our way to achieving the Council
member’s goal of planting 1,000 trees during his time in office.
● We are also focused on a number of HPD violations and have been working
closely with tenants and community members to get them addressed.
● We are also trying to address the issues about the super sidewalks on 9th
Avenue so that they are more user-friendly for pedestrians.

4Remarks from Elected Officials and Representatives
State Assemblymember ● Continues to be very concerned about the illegal sale of cannabis, especially
Linda Rosenthal near schools; committed to rooting out illegal smoke shops in our
community
● Introduced a bill to ban the distribution of blueprints to create 3-D guns
● Also introduced a bill that would ban a person from buying more than one
gun in any 30-day period
● Insurance companies routinely refuse to insure buildings where tenants use
housing vouchers (Sec. 8) to pay their rent; this is so wrong. I have
introduced a bill to put an end to this.
● Vornado and EDC must be held accountable for the promises made years
ago about improvements to Piers 92 and 94.
City Council Member Gale ● Creating an E-Bike Stakeholders Task Force to address all of the concerns
Brewer and injuries that have resulted from the proliferation of e-bikes.
● Continuing to work on getting rid of the downtown heliport; keeping an eye
on the 60-day right-to-shelter change; the special use permit for MSG; and
the planting of more trees for a tree canopy.
Eric Strazza, Manhattan ● In June, we held one of our gun buybacks, during which we were able to
District Attorney Alvin recover over 50 firearms (including some ghost guns and semi-automatic
Bragg weapons).
● Co-sponsored another Art of Healing Festival: East Harlem in June, which
is designed to heal gun violence trauma through creative arts (e.g. art,
dance, poetry); it was super fun and we look forward to doing more.
● Convened our next series of Small Business Alliance meetings
● Awarded $6 million to Harlem-based non-profit The Bridge to provide
mental health support and peer services to needy people in 4 focus
neighborhoods, including Hell’s Kitchen/Midtown West. Designed to
“meet people where they are and to build trust.”
Dana Schmerzler, State ● If your family receives health insurance through Medicaid, Child Health
Senator Liz Krueger’s Plus or Essential Plan, then you may have to recertify your eligibility before
Office July 31. If you’re not sure if it’s your time to recertify, you can call our
office and we can put you in touch with community health advocates.
● We have been offering a series of Healthy Homes Workshops since the
winter, and shortly we will launch a series of workshops about financial
planning. Be sure to look on our web site for the details.
Manhattan Borough ● The FDNY deserves tremendous credit for the way they handled the crane
President Mark Levine’s fire this morning on a high-rise at the corner of 10th Ave. and 44th street.
Office The FDNY and EMS deserve a big round of applause for their
extraordinary handling of this emergency, which could have been so much
worse.
● It is time for us to introduce standards for indoor air quality in NYC.
We’ve introduced a package of bills that will require air quality monitoring
in public schools and other City-owned and managed buildings, and even in
certain cases, in private, residential and office buildings. Data needs to be
tracked and made publicly available. I hope MCB4 will support this
multi-year effort.

Remarks from Elected Officials and Representatives
US Congressman Jerry ● Co-sponsored Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which took 12 years to pass,
Nadler but finally went into effect this summer. This legislation allows pregnant
and postpartum workers to get the accommodations they need to have a safe
and healthy pregnancy.
● Also introduced the Respect for Marriage Act,which took 13 years to pass,
that has gone into effect this year.
● New Yorkers deserve a Penn Station that is worthy of the greatest city in
the world. The construction project will allow us to protect the long-term
economic viability of the city and the entire Tri-State Region.
● One of my top priorities is to unlock federal dollars to expand access to
mental health care for those who need it the most.
Carl Wilson from City ● Despite pressure for a 10-year renewal for the Madison Square Garden
Councilmember Erik special permit, the Council Member supported a 5 year renewal to keep
Bottcher’s office pressure on all parties to work out a plan to deliver a Penn Station that is
worthy of New York City.
● Major workforce development initiative: West Side Work Coalition:
committed to creating and sustaining strong pipelines to employment
opportunities and growing industries with an initial focus on NYCHA
Elliott-Chelsea and NYCHA Fulton Houses.
● Co-sponsored a new law passed by the City Council to regulate unlicensed
cannabis shops. The law holds commercial landlords accountable for their
tenants’ illegal sale of marijuana, cigarettes and vaping products, and the
law also requires quarterly enforcement reports to be made to the Mayor
and City Council.
NY State ● Two of my bills were recently signed into law by Governor Hochul:
Assemblymember Tony ○ to protect unpaid interns on the basis of gender identity and
Simone expression○ to protect our offshore ocean habitats by addressing why sharks
have been getting too close to our beaches
● Recently introduced the Commercial E-Bike Licensing Act to try to make
streets safer for all of us.
● It’s critical that we get Penn Station right, and that it serves our resident
commuters.
● We need more teeth in our cannabis laws.
Bracha Rosenberg from ● Our office has distributed thousands of reusable bags, masks and Covid-19
Manhattan Borough tests at events throughout the District this summer, and we are participating
President Mark Levine’s in lots of back-to-school events now too.
Office ● We have an excellent Back to School Guide that has resources about how to
find free after school programs, access childcare and healthcare, mentorship
programs, and food assistance. You can find the Guide on our website

St and 8th Avenue), and remote participation via Zoom by other members of the Board and

Presentation and Public Hearing
Second Vice Chair Leslie Boghosian-Murphy provided an overview of the draft FY2025 Statement of
District Needs for Manhattan CB4, and then invited input from the public on the draft. There was only
one speaker for the session (Miriam Fisher), who asked if subway accessibility (especially in
connection with more elevators to the subways) could be prioritized in the Statement of District Needs.
Leslie explained that the issue would be taken up by the CB4 Transportation Committee.
Presentation
Midtown North Precinct Commanding Officer John O’Connell offered a report regarding precinct
activities. He was pleased to report that crime is down 13%, and he spoke positively about foot
patrols, accessibility and improved communications. He reported that the precinct is the fifth best
command in all of New York City with regards to crime reduction compared to 2022. He also said that
they assign their officers on foot as much as possible, and that the goal is 2 hours on foot per tour, but
in reality it is probably closer to one hour per tour. The officer can be reached at
john.oconnell2@nypd.org or 212-767-8413.

Reports From Elected Officials
Assemblymember Tony ● We had a Town Hall last week that was well attended, where I got to hear
Simone about a wide range of constituent issues. We will be having more of these,
as well as “Talks with Tony” which we will start soon.
● We will be hosting several flu vaccine events in the next month – more
details on our web site.
● I did a walk-through recently to address safety issues on West 42nd Street,
which was very productive. I will also be doing a walk-through to address
similar safety issues on West 45th Street.
● Shout-out to Yadira Jimenez, former MCB4 member who is our new
manager of Constituent Services. She was honored last week for her
tremendous work on housing issues with our constituents.
● Along with many others, I have asked the federal government to help with
the migrant influx in the city. I am also working to expedite work
authorizations for our newest arrivals.
● I am also asking for stronger state action to address the housing crisis in
NYC.Councilmember Erik ● Tomorrow I am introducing legislation that will allow the City to padlock
Bottcher shops that sell illegal cannbis and that sell cannabis to people under 21. At
the moment, we have over 8,000 unlicensed cannabis shops in NYC.
● We passed a bill a few weeks ago prohibiting “ghost cars” where people
obscure their license plates to avoid tolls or evade other regulations.
● The City recently passed my legislation that requires the City to develop an
Urban Forest Master Plan with a goal of achieving 30% tree coverage
across NYC. This will help with flood mitigation, clean air, habitats for
birds and insects, and quality of life in our neighborhoods.
● We are getting ready to cut the ribbon on two recently renovated parks –
Chelsea Park on 28th Street and 10th Ave., and Hell’s Kitchen Park. My
goal as a City Council member is to renovate every park in Council District
3.
● We hosted a Zoom Forum last week with NYC Special Narcotics
Prosecutor Bridget Brennan. It is well worth a watch.
Bracha Rosenberg, Office ● The MBP’s office is very concerned about the rise in anti-semitism and
of Manhattan Borough islamophobia. We are working with all relevant agencies.
President Mark Levine ● Earlier today, the MBP hosted and celebrated veterans at the Met, in
collaboration with Councilmember Powers and Representative Nadler.
● The MBP continues to be very focused on increasing accessibility to public
bathrooms in NYC. The office is live-streaming about the issue today.
There are two City Council bills that the MBP is promoting to help address
this issue: Intro 1154 and Intro 1096.
● This coming weekend is our office’s Day of Action during which we will
be hosting Community Clean-Ups at 5 locations in the District.
● Lastly, a quick reminder to Community Board members to please attend our
Leadership Training Series the week of Nov. 13th.

Hearings
effective and given in two doses, 28 days apart. She went on to provide answers to
some of the common questions about the vaccine and entertained questions from
the members.
Public Hearing: Starrett-Lehigh Building and Terminal Warehouse Buildings (West 26-
28 St. and 11/12 Ave) Scoping Hearing for Draft Environmental Impact Statement
Betty Mackintosh, Co-Chair of the Chelsea Land Use Committee, opened the
hearing on the Draft Scope of a targeted EIS for the zoning related to both buildings.
The matter is the subject of Agenda Item 10. No public speakers came forward, so
the hearing was closed.
Presentation: Midtown North Precinct Commanding Officer, Deputy Inspector
Megan O'Malley
Ms. O’Malley provided updates on precinct activity and noted that Midtown North
finished 2020 with a 30% reduction in crime. That statistic is an obvious reflection of
fewer tourists and residents being on the street during the pandemic. She went on to
answer questions from Board members, including one about street closures during
protests near police precincts, and another about working with the community to
increase security around the Skyline Hotel.
Public Session
Lowell Kern Chair Lowell Kern prefaced the public session with news of the final decision by the City
and the NYPD to move the Tow Pound from Pier 76. He also announced that DHS has
finally promised to move one of the three temporary shelters on West 36th Street by this
coming Friday.Alan Chun Mr. Chun is a senior vice president of Brookfield and has been working for eight years on
the Manhattan West development project. He stated that the success of the project is due
largely to community involvement facilitated by CB4. He thanked the BLP Committee for
its help with the Pendry Hotel application to the SLA.
Brian Weber Mr. Weber is a resident of West 36th Street and the co-chair of the West 36th Street
Block Association. He is also a public member of CB4. He thanked the Board for providing
a forum for dealing with the shelters on his block and stated his belief that the decision to
move one of them will go a long way to alleviating problems.
Anne Santore Ms. Santore is also part of the West 36th Street community that has been subjected to
violence and disruption by the residents of the shelters on her block. She expressed her
gratitude and joy for the news of the relocation of one of the shelters.
Susan Peters Ms. Peters spoke about her perception of the dangers posed by cell phone antennas. She
stated that there are currently 8,000 antennas in the City and 4,000 more are planned.
She criticized the City DoITT for ignoring studies that revealed adverse health effects of
cell towers, unlike several countries in Europe that have done otherwise with respect to
5G technology.
Randolph Barksdale Mr. Barksdale thanked the Board for the good news regarding the West 36th Street
shelters but maintained that there is still much more work that needs to be done. He
recounted his experience of being assaulted and threatened during the past week.
John Challice Mr. Challice praised the work of several Board members and elected officials for their
work on the West 36th Street issues. He looks forward to the day when the temporary
shelters will be cleared, and the City returns to normal.
Lisa Wager Ms. Wager is the Director of the Office of Government Relations at the Fashion Institute
of Technology. She made the following announcements:
• The plans for reopening FIT have been approved by SUNY.
• The Winter session is up and running and the Spring Semester begins on January
25.
• All classes will continue to be held remotely. Courses include business, marketing,
fashion design, and computer technology.
Bernard Freedman Mr. Freedman resides on West 36th Street. He thanked the Board for its continuing
involvement with the shelter issues in his neighborhood.
Thuy Pham First Vice Chair Jeffrey LeFrancois read the testimony of Ms. Pham that she submitted via
email because she did not have access to a microphone. She is a member of the Board but
made her comments as a member of the public in her capacity as president of the
23rd/24th Chelsea Tenants Association that represents 250 tenants. They have been
battling building workers who do not wear masks continually. Also, common hallway
windows have been sealed, preventing air circulation. Several tenant groups have taken
up the issue of air circulation in light of the pandemic and she asked that CB4 get involved
as well.
Remarks from Elected Officials and Representatives
Council Speaker Mr. Johnson gave the following updates:
Corey Johnson • He expressed his concerns about whether people can access the COVID-19 vaccine
fast enough now that more people have become eligible to receive it. One positivedevelopment is the opening of two 24/7 inoculation mega-sites, with the promise
of more to come. The Council will hold an oversight hearing next Tuesday to review
the City’s plan for distributing the vaccine in an equitable, safe, and efficient
manner.
• The good news about the tow pound being moved off of Pier 76 came as a result of
the hard work of CB4 and the Speaker’s office. But it was pressure from the
Governor that finally pushed the City to promise action by the end of the month.
• More good news was the opening of the Moynihan Train Hall over the weekend
and CB4 can take some credit for that happening.
• The Speaker thanked the Board for its work on the NYCHA development project,
noting the participation of Joe Restuccia, Betty Mackintosh, Mike Noble, and
Hector Vasquez on the Chelsea NYCHA Working Group.
• Last month Mr. Johnson introduced legislation to address the City’s confusing and
complex land use regulations. It is based on a comprehensive planning process that
is meant to streamline the City’s planning mandates into a single process. The
proposal is outlined on the Council website:
https://council.nyc.gov/press/2020/12/16/2052/
• Mr. Johnson announced his enrollment as a part-time student at the School of
General Studies of Columbia University. He said that he was encouraged to apply
to the program at 38 years of age by the Borough President who graduated from
the school when she was 47.
• The Speaker answered questions from the members that dealt mainly with the
temporary shelters in Hell’s Kitchen and the long-term planning needed to address
the homelessness problem facing the City. He pointed to the Council’s plan that
was laid out in January of 2020 as the best plan that the City has ever had but was
interrupted by the pandemic and the need for emergency measures to ensure
public health and safety.
Borough President Ms. Brewer provided her monthly updates:
Gale Brewer • She reflected on her experience as a moderator for the Community Listening Tours
in Manhattan that included the NYPD and several civil rights groups and believes
that CB4 should take a greater part in the conversation about police reform. Her
office put out the Police Reform Toolkit that lists many resources to aid in that
endeavor. It can be downloaded here http://www.manhattanbp.nyc.gov/wp-
content/uploads/2020/12/FinalPoliceReformToolkitnocrops.pdf
• Helicopter noise is an ongoing issue, with the number of 311 calls increasing
dramatically during the pandemic. She reconvened the Helicopter Task Force in
December, with elected officials, the NYC Economic Development Corporation, the
Federal Aviation Administration, the Eastern Region Helicopter Council, Hudson
River Park Trust, and helicopter companies. They discussed the origin of these
helicopters, the impact of unmitigated noise, and proposed solutions. It was
revealed that the main driver of the problem is tourism originating in New Jersey.
People are showing up in large groups to board helicopters so that they can take
pictures while flying and then post them on Instagram. She has been in touch with
NYC & Co., the city’s tourist agency, to determine if any of their helicopter partners
are violating the City’s ban on nonessential flights over Manhattan. The next step is
to meet with elected officials from New Jersey.
• She thanked Lowell Kern and CB4, along with Steve Banks of DHS, for the progress
being made on the West 36th Street issues.
• She acknowledged the news about the tow pound and indicated that vehicles
would now be towed to Queens and the Bronx. This is too far to travel to retrieve
your vehicle and it increases the time that tow trucks spend on the streets ofManhattan. Ms. Brewer is pushing the NYPD to find a permanent spot in
Manhattan.
• She noted that there is a continuing need to engage in conversations with more
service providers to resolve the safety issues at the Skyline Hotel.
• Ms. Brewer gave praise to the Chelsea NYCHA Working Group and noted the
importance of having many groups within it that are generally accepted by the
public as being trustworthy.
• She is very supportive of the arts and is therefore grateful for the federal Save Our
Stages Act.
• The Borough President website has a page dedicated to COVID-19 which provides a
one-stop portal for testing and vaccine information:
https://www.manhattanbp.nyc.gov/testing-and-vaccines/
• Applications for new and current community board members are due on February
1. Manhattan nonprofits, schools, and other organizations that serve New York City
can apply for capital funding from the Borough President’s office. Information,
including deadlines, can be found here:
https://www.manhattanbp.nyc.gov/everything-ive-heard-about-money/
Senator Brad Mr. Hoylman provided the following updates:
Hoylman • He commented on the violence that took place at the Capitol and in Albany,
assuring everyone that he would do his best to remove the Trump legacy in the
City and state, beginning with removing Donald Trump’s name from a state park.
• He is carrying legislation calling for the return of 24/7 subway service, which the
MTA can do without a vote of its board.
• The COVID-19 Emergency Eviction and Foreclosure Prevention Act now protects
New Yorkers from eviction and foreclosure proceedings once they file a simple
hardship declaration. The Covid Rent Relief Program is also in effect, providing for
a one-time rent subsidy to eligible households.
• The Senator has been pushing the state to get the COVID vaccine out more quickly
and to expand its availability. Testing also needs to be increased. He and other
elected officials will host a pop-up testing site tomorrow at 327 Eighth Avenue
between 9 am and 4:30 pm.
• The Senator sponsored the Police Statistics and Transparency Act which went into
effect last month. It requires the state to record the sex, race, and ethnicity of
anyone charged with a crime or misdemeanor, and that of anyone who dies in
police custody. The data collected through this provision will give lawmakers – for
the first time – the information they need to see how crimes are adjudicated in
New York.
• The Governor signed a bill sponsored by Mr. Hoylman that deals with so-called
“predatory equity.” It describes a practice whereby someone buys a property that
is mortgaged to such a level that it cannot be repaid without forcing tenants out to
make room for higher-paying ones. The bill authorizes a study that will provide the
information needed to address the problem.
• Mr. Hoylman will be focusing on transportation safety in the current legislative
session. He has introduced legislation that will give New York City the ability to
tailor speed limits that are appropriate for a particular area. This is relevant now
with the advent of outdoor dining and the increased use of bike lanes.
• The Senator has also proposed giving the City the authority to implement universal
speed cameras and not be limited to the number dictated by the state.
• Mr. Hoylman acknowledged the great success of the Board and others in getting a
final resolution of the Tow Pound relocation.• The legislature passed a bill in the last session that the Senator voted for and it
goes into effect on January 10. It requires that any decision to place a homeless
shelter in a community be subject to a public review process before a local
community board.
Assemblymember Ms. Rosenthal referred to the chaos occurring in Washington, saying that everyone will
Linda Rosenthal remember being at this meeting on such a historic night. She is looking toward the future
for more civil discourse. She stated that the vaccine rollout was botched. People need to
get the vaccine quickly. The City and state are not cooperating.
A moratorium on residential evictions and foreclosure proceedings was passed in Albany.
She hopes that the new administration in Washington will help New Yorkers with funding
when all the bills come due after the pandemic.
She has a meeting set up with Greg Russ, the chair of NYCHA because the City is trying to
create a trust to raise billions of dollars to fund repairs of NYCHA buildings. The question is
how far this goes towards privatization.
Ms. Rosenthal announced her appointment as Chair of the Committee on Social Services.
Assemblymember Mr. Gottfried provided some thoughts about the riot at the Capitol in Washington and
Dick Gottfried provided the following monthly updates:
• He was the author of the Hudson River Park Act in 1998 that required the City to
use its efforts to vacate the tow pound as soon as possible. Now that it appears to
be happening, he is hoping it’s going to be quick. Another provision of the Act has
to do with getting the 30th Street Heliport out of the park, so that will be the next
order of business.
• The legislative session convened in Albany today and Mr. Gottfried is still Chair of
the Health Committee. As such, he has been trying to push the Governor and the
Mayor to move more quickly on the distribution of the COVID vaccine.
• Yesterday, there was an article in the New York Times on medical debt focusing on
the Northwell Health System which has brought lawsuits against 2,500 patients
since the pandemic began. He is working on a bill covering medical debt.
• So many of the problems with COVID and in obtaining health care are made worse
by the way we pay for health care in this country. That is why he is continuing the
fight for the NY Health Act, the single-payer bill.
• He signed the letter with CB4 on the position of moving one of the shelters off 36th
Street.
• He has been involved in efforts over the years to legalize, tax, and regulate the
adult use of marijuana. In 1977, he co-sponsored the decriminalization law and is
currently working on a bill for adult recreational use.
Phillip Ellison for Mr. Ellison announced the release of the Public Advocates’ 2020 Worst Landlord Watchlist.

Meeting Date /
existence of a quorum. The meeting can be viewed on YouTube:

Public Hearing: Renewal of Physical Culture Establishment Special Permit for Barry’s
Boot Camp Located at 135 West 20th Street.
Presentations / Public
Hearings
Betty Mackintosh, Co-Chair of the Chelsea Land Use Committee, opened the
hearing and with no speakers coming forward, declared it closed.
Public Hearing: Manhattan Community Board 4 Response to the Fiscal Year 2022
Preliminary Budget
Jessica Chait, Chair of the Budget Task Force, explained the CB4 Response and
noted that it was the subject of Agenda Item 19. With no public speakers coming
forward, the hearing was closed.
Public Session
James Wallace Mr. Wallace, who is a Board member, spoke on his own behalf in conveying condolences
to a fellow Board member who recently lost a loved one.
Brian Weber Mr. Weber is a resident of West 36th Street and the co-chair of the West 36th Street
Block Association. He is also a public member of CB4. He referenced the announcement
made at the last Full Board meeting that one of the temporary shelters on West 36th
Street would be moving to West 40th Street. He noted that the move occurred two days
later and that living conditions on his block improved immediately thereafter. He
acknowledged that there is still much that needs to be done in the West 30s to make the
neighborhood livable again.
Julie Rosen Ms. Rosen introduced her colleague Bill Higgins from Higgins Quasebarth & Partners to
discuss the McGraw-Hill Building letter that is the subject of Agenda Item 1.
Bill Higgins Mr. Higgins and his firm are the historic preservation consultants for the McGraw-Hill
Building whose application before the Landmarks Preservation Commission was firstdiscussed at a Clinton/Hell’s Kitchen Land Use Committee meeting in January. The
proposal that Mr. Higgins presented at that meeting included replacing the iconic McGraw
Hill sign at the top of the building with the street address of the building: 330 West 42nd
Street. The thought of removing the name McGraw-Hill from the landmarked building did
not sit well with the committee members and their comments resulted in the owners
subsequently agreeing to withdraw that part of the proposal. Mr. Higgins thanked the
members for the level of discourse and civility that he experienced during the
conversation.
Lisa Wager Ms. Wager is the Director of the Office of Government Relations at the Fashion Institute
of Technology. She made the following announcements:
• A FIT graduate had a role in the Presidential Inauguration this year, just as another
graduate did in 2008 when Michelle Obama wore a shimmery yellow coat and
dress. This year, Lady Gaga’s entire ensemble – a fitted navy jacket, red skirt, and
gilded dove-of-peace broach – was designed by Daniel Rosenberry. Also, Kamala
Harris’ great-nieces wore leopard-patterned coats designed by a FIT alumnus
based in Oakland, California.
• There are several FIT events for Black History Month that are open to the public.
The Black Student Union has created a multimedia online exhibition called Back to
the Present. It includes virtual talks with the artists. A full schedule of events can
be viewed at http://www.fitnyc.edu/diversity-equity-inclusion/black-history.php
Marni Halasa Ms. Halasa spoke on behalf of a group of residents of the Fulton and Elliott-Chelsea
Houses who have stood in opposition to any form of privatization in those developments.
They anticipate that the RFP process will begin soon and requested that all activity related
to RAD and the Blueprint for Change be postponed until the pandemic is over.
Susan Numeroff Ms. Numeroff asked whether the Board or the District Manager was aware of a recent
City Council bill known as the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act (COPA). She was
advised to send information about the legislation to the Board office so that it could be
reviewed and perhaps taken up by one of the land use committees.
Susan Peters Ms. Peters voiced the same concerns that she did at the January Board meeting regarding
the health dangers posed by the profusion of wireless antennas around the City. She
alluded to various scientific studies that she offered to discuss with anyone who wished to
reach out to her.
Kathleen Treat Ms. Treat appeared on-screen beside her husband Martin Treat, a Board member. As an
admirer of the McGraw-Hill Building, she expressed her support for Agenda Item 1. She
also supports outdoor dining and Agenda Item 11.
Remarks from Elected Officials and Representatives
Carl Wilson for Mr. Wilson provided the following updates from the Speaker’s office:
Council Speaker • The Speaker will host a COVID-19 Q+A with other West Side elected officials, the
Corey Johnson Department of Health, and several community-based organizations on Thursday,
February 4 from 6:30 – 8:30 pm.
• On February 23, the office will be hosting a DOB Office Hours event for
constituents to speak with an agency representative. Appointments can be set up
via email to the office.• The office is working with Ace Sanitation to provide additional sanitation services
along a strip on 10th Avenue in Hell’s kitchen for one day each week. The hope is
that it can be arranged for Thursdays when the Department of Sanitation does not
pick up baskets.
• The office has continued its pandemic wellness call program now that COVID
infection levels have risen. Last month, volunteers made over 2000 calls to seniors
to check their health and basic needs.
• Last month, the office worked with tenant associations and other community
centers in the District to deliver its one-hundred thousandth meal to seniors facing
food insecurity.
Borough President Ms. Brewer gave the following updates:
Gale Brewer • The COVID-19 vaccine access and distribution issue has been the predominant
focus of the office. A task force has been meeting every Tuesday at 3 pm and some
calls have included as many as 350 people. The many websites that currently exist
have been difficult to navigate and do not give a sufficient number of people the
ability to book an appointment.
• The office made an effort to alleviate some of the safety concerns that arose when
people were moved from one temporary shelter to a different one on West 43rd
Street. Masks, hand sanitizer, and bags were handed out to residents, and support
was offered to them.
• The bill that was passed three years ago on open storefronts requires the owners
of every building in the City to report to the Department of Finance by the end of
February information regarding their buildings. This data will be available to the
public and may be used by the Board to decrease the number of vacancies in the
District by working with business owners and entrepreneurs.
• The work is continuing on the helicopter noise issue, with progress being made in
getting cooperation from elected officials in New Jersey where most of the tourist
flights originate.
• Ms. Brewer commended the Board members who are on the Chelsea NYCHA
Working Group – some of whom are NYCHA residents – for their work. She also
congratulated the Board for establishing the Social and Racial Justice Task Force
and asked that it reach out to the community for more racially diverse applicants
to CB4. The application deadline has been extended to February 22.
• Ms. Brewer thanked Chair Kern for his work on Hudson River Park and the removal
of the tow pound.
Assemblymember Mr. Gottfried provided these updates:
Dick Gottfried • He criticized state and City officials for their failure to prepare for the vaccination
of 20 million New Yorkers once COVID-19 vaccines became available. In addition to
that, the Assembly has tried for months to obtain information from the state
Department of Health on the number of people who contracted the virus in a
nursing home and died in a hospital. The DOH has claimed that it could not compile
the numbers. As things turned out, last week, Attorney General Tish James was
able to release a report that gave a reliable estimate of those numbers. And, within
hours of the report being made public, the DOH announced that it was almost
done with its report. The data that the DOH finally reported was in line with that in
the Attorney General’s report.
• The A.G.’s report not only covers nursing home deaths but reveals a lot about the
poor quality of care that many nursing home residents have been getting duringthe pandemic and prior years because of short staffing, inadequate enforcement of
code compliance by the DOH and, inadequate funding.
• The A.G.’s report also focused on the fact that for-profit nursing homes – which
used to have a third of all nursing homes beds in New York – now have about two
thirds and the quality of care in such places is far worse than that in non-profit
nursing homes where death rates are much lower. The report also pointed out
recent legislation that gave health care providers immunity from any kind of civil or
criminal liability for their treatment of COVID patients, unless it could be proved
that they were guilty of gross negligence. The report validates Mr. Gottfried’s
belief that this legislation has caused unnecessary harm.
• The Health Committee that Mr. Gottfried chairs in the Assembly has been working
on legislation to address some of the concerns raised by the A.G.’s report. Such
measures would mandate safe staffing levels; require the DOH to develop nursing
home data for immediate release to the press and public; require that every
nursing home devote at least a mandatory minimum percentage of its revenue to
actual patient care.
• The Assembly is also going to try to crack down on the number of for-profit nursing
home beds in the state and provide greater funding for home care which will allow
more people to remain at home and out of nursing homes.
Senator Robert Senator Jackson reviewed his recent activities:
Jackson • The State will soon be in the red and we are going to have to raise revenue.
Everyone in Albany is expecting help from the federal government but it won’t be
enough, so we will be discussing how to raise taxes. And that may mean having to
test our Democratic supermajority in the legislature if the Governor chooses an
income threshold that is too low.
• My priorities in the Senate during the pandemic have been 1) no one is evicted
from their home, 2) people have enough food to survive this pandemic, and 3) our
mental and physical health. Education is the next priority because it has been my
main focus while in public office.
• The Walking While Trans Act – which Senator Hoylman sponsored -- passed
yesterday and the Governor immediately signed it into law.
• The Legislature created the Armistad Commission in 2005 to review how the topic
of slavery is taught in schools and to give the Governor recommendations. Very
little has come out of it, and I believe that is because it is controlled by the
Department of State. I have been pushing to have it moved to the Department of
Education, where it logically belongs.
• We passed a bill that alters the way an employer’s unemployment experience
rating is measured as a result of the pandemic: it freezes ratings for one year any
experience rating that would otherwise be raised because of an employee having
to claim unemployment due to a business closure. Another bill that we passed
during this election year would change the petitioning period to start on March 2
and end on March 25. It would also reduce the number of signatures required on a
political campaign petition by 70%.
• My office is working with NY Presbyterian Hospital in Washington Heights to
enable everyone 65 and older who lives in northern Manhattan, the Bronx, and the
31st Senatorial District to obtain a COVID-19 vaccination.
Luke Wolf for Mr. Wolf offered updates from the Comptroller’s office:
Comptroller Scott • The Comptroller will continue the process of divesting over $4 billion of pension
Stringer fund investments in the fossil fuel industry.• The Comptroller released a blueprint for strengthening public health and safety in
New York City. It can be viewed here:
https://comptroller.nyc.gov/reports/strengthening-public-safety-in-new-york-city/
• Last week the Comptroller sent a letter to the Department of Education regarding
the “midyear adjustment,” which requires schools to return allocated funds to the
City that were based on enrollment numbers in the Fall. But because some
students did not return to their schools because of the pandemic, some schools
have to pay the money back and most schools cannot carry that burden. The
Comptroller is asking that schools be held harmless and have amnesty through the
school year.
• Last month the Comptroller released the Fair Shot NYC plan to ensure the
equitable distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine. It asks businesses and the City to
provide time off for people to get vaccines and calls for doing culturally-competent
outreach for people getting the shot. The plan can be found here:
https://comptroller.nyc.gov/newsroom/comptroller-stringer-releases-fair-shot-
nyc-plan-for-vaccine-equity/
Robert Atterbury Mr. Atterbury gave updates on the Congressman’s activities in Washington and the District:
for Congressman • Mr. Nadler is the dean of the New York delegation and, as such, has been helping
Jerry Nadler new members settle into their new roles. He is also the most senior Jewish
member and leader of that group. So, much of his time lately has been devoted to
organizing the House Judiciary Committee as Chair and welcoming new members.
• The Congressman’s biggest priority right now is COVID relief. But he is still pushing
other priorities through the committee as well. They include democracy reform
legislation regarding redistricting, voting rights and enforcement, immigration
reform, antitrust reform, LGBT equality, and racial justice reform.
• The Judiciary Committee wrote the report that accompanied the recent Articles of
Impeachment of Donald Trump and Mr. Nadler helped write the actual Articles
themselves.
• Since January, the Committee has been pushing the Department of Homeland
Security to follow President Biden’s orders on reducing or stopping deportations,
which it has been resisting, and to protect the Urban Area Security Initiative which
provides large cities like New York with crucial security funds. The Committee has
also been pushing the Justice Department to prosecute every person involved in
the insurrection on the Capitol Building on January 6.
• The Congressman reintroduced the Safe and Quiet Skies Act, which would regulate
commercial air tours and give local jurisdictions authority to determine what is
appropriate for their area beyond the provisions of the Act and the jurisdiction of
the FAA.
• Mr. Nadler introduced the Equity and Inclusion Enforcement Act to restore the
ability of students across the nation to sue schools for systemic discrimination.

Presentation: PANYNJ on the Redevelopment of the Port Authority Bus Terminal
JD Noland, Chair of the Clinton/Hell’s Kitchen Land Use Committee, provided
Presentations /
background information before the presentation, beginning with the moment that the
Public Hearings
Hell’s Kitchen community became aware of the plan. A couple of years ago, the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey came before the Clinton/Hell’s Kitchen Land Use
Committee to announce that it was going to build a new Bus Terminal and have to
demolish a few buildings along the way. That news led to three events in the community:
1) a Town Hall meeting at Metro Baptist Church that hundreds of people from the
community attended; 2) the formation of the Hell’s Kitchen South Coalition comprised of
residents who started designing what they wanted to see; and 3) the formation of a
working group within CB4 led by Burt Lazarin, the former Chair. The Port Authority Bus
Terminal Working Group is made up of the Board’s Land Use, Transportation, and Housing
Committee leadership. It has continued to collaborate with the Port Authority, keeping the
focus on the demands of the community: better air quality, affordable housing, green
space, no eminent domain, and no busses on the streets.
Justin Bernbach, the Director of Government and Community Relations for New York,
introduced his colleagues who would assist in the presentation: Michael Lavery, Steve
Plate, Glenn Guzi, Michael Kraft, and Cate Britell. Ms. Britell’s department operates the Bus
Terminal and Mr. Plate’s department will build the replacement.
Mr. Bernbach reviewed the stages in the redevelopment process using slides with the
following captions:
• Planning & Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) Process
• THEN: Early Bus Terminal
• NOW: The World’s Busiest Terminal
• Planning for Replacement 2013-2017
• Current Planning Process
• Alternatives Evaluated Against Two Critical Screening Criteria
• Three Alternatives Advanced to Planning Level Document
• Stakeholder Input Summer 2019
• January 21st Announcement
• A New Midtown TerminalMr. Plate discussed the new build-in-place Terminal that is envisioned by the final
scoping document that was released on January 21st. It consists of three parts:
• The Main Terminal – the new terminal will be built in the same space as the
existing terminal. This and the other parts of the terminal will be built entirely on
Port Authority-owned space. It will have 5 floors to accommodate 160 gates and
give direct access to 12 subway lines and 5 NYC Transit bus routes. It is also
designed to accommodate electric buses.
• The Staging/Storage & Intercity Terminal – this facility will sit between 9th and
10th Avenues and have 4 floors for garaging 300-350 busses and 2 floors to handle
intercity busses at 40 gates. The facility will reduce street congestion and
pedestrian foot traffic in the neighborhood. It will also serve as a temporary
staging facility during the construction of the Main Terminal.
• The Ramp – this is a completely new ramp system positioned over Galvin Plaza
providing direct access to the Lincoln Tunnel. There will also be an underpass
under 9th Avenue to provide entry to the lower level and reduce on-street
congestion and the need to enter on 40th Street.
A key part of the redevelopment project is the addition of green space in the area south
of the Storage Facility in the form of a 3- to 3.5-acre park that is about the size of Gramercy
Park or the Great Lawn in Bryant Park.
The presenters entertained several questions from the Board and the public regarding
building heights, installation of a green roof, and the use of art in the Main Terminal and
green space.
Public Hearing: Special Permit Application for 314 W. 43rd Street a/k/a 311 West 42nd
Street (8/9)
JD Noland, Chair of the Clinton/Hell’s Kitchen Land Use Committee, opened the hearing
and with no speakers coming forward, declared it closed.
Public Session
Leslie Thrope Ms. Thrope is the executive director of Housing Conservation Coordinators, located on
10th Avenue between 52nd and 53rd Streets. Her organization has been in the
neighborhood for 48 years doing housing, tenant organizing, and eviction prevention for
low-income and poor residents. It provides legal services, and work concerning
government entitlements, consumer debt, domestic violence, and life management
support. She noted that the eviction moratorium officially ended last week but was
extended to May 1 for those who file a hardship declaration with the court or their
landlord.
Carolyn Perch Ms. Perch is a resident of 365 West 20th Street who voiced her opposition to the liquor
license application for Milk and Hops – Agenda Item 5. She stated that the establishment
was originally intended to be a beer and sandwich bar, not a bar with a full liquor license.
She worries that it will become a noisy hotspot once the pandemic ends. She said the
acoustic testing that was done according to the Board’s stipulations was not a true test of
what she experiences in reality.Lori Esposito Ms. Esposito spoke in support of Milk and Hops, stating that her apartment looks out over
their space and that she has never had any noise issues to complain about. She called it “a
nice neighborhood bar.”
Megan Weatherby Ms. Weatherby is the executive director of the Art Deco Society of New York which
advocates for the appreciation and preservation of Art Deco design, architecture, and
heritage. She commended the Board for its work in preserving the crown of the McGraw-
Hill Building and the efforts to get the interior lobby designated. Her concern is that these
efforts may not be enough now that demolition permits are in place. She would like the
Board to go further and ask that the DOB revoke those permits during the time that the
LPC is considering the interior landmark application. She also asked the Board to engage
with the building owners to come up with an alternative to their current plan.
Christine Berthet Ms. Berthet, a Board member speaking for herself and in recognition of Black History
Month, honored the memory of Garrett Morgan, the inventor of the three-position traffic
signal that was patented in 1923 and sold to General Electric.
Lisa Wager Ms. Wager is the Director of the Office of Government Relations at the Fashion Institute
of Technology. She made the following announcements:
• An interdisciplinary group of FIT graduate students partnered to create an
interactive website that allows a user to share their experiences from when they
were new to New York. Just by clicking on a map location, the user can record an
experience and also share it on Instagram. It is available here:
https://www.ournycjourneys.com/
• FIT graduate Michelle Feinberg owns a manufacturing facility in the Garment
District called New York Embroidery Studio. She shifted her business when the
pandemic hit by expanding her operation and opening a new factory in Brooklyn
to produce protective gear. The Brooklyn operation now produces more than
100,000 masks and surgical gowns per week for hospitals across the City.
Remarks from Elected Officials and Representatives
Senate Majority U.S. Senate Majority Leader Schumer commended the Board for its work in service to
Leader Chuck the community. He then went on to recount his feeling of joy when he heard the results of
Schumer the Senatorial election in Georgia that made him the Majority Leader of the Senate. That
emotion, he said, was replaced by a feeling of awe for the great responsibility placed on
the shoulders of the slim 50-vote Democratic majority because of the COVID crisis and the
economic crisis with small businesses going under, people losing their jobs, kids not going
to school, and colleges disrupted. But, even before the pandemic, there were other
problems. One question that Mr. Schumer often asks himself is why so many people voted
for a person like Donald Trump in 2016 and 2020. The answer, he believes, is that they
didn’t think they had a path forward or any opportunity in their lives. They didn’t feel what
people usually felt in the past that, if you worked hard, you would have a good life for
yourself. So, Mr. Schumer feels the Democratic majority has a big responsibility to create a
bold, big change that keeps people from voting for another Donald Trump.
He went on to recount the horrific events of January 6th, with him sitting as the putative
Majority Leader in the House Chamber at 1:00 pm when he was grabbed by a police officer
and told that they had to leave because he was in danger. Upon leaving, he came within 15
feet of the insurrectionists. This, he said, again made him realize that change was needed.On a positive note, Mr. Schumer reviewed the COVID-related legislation that was passed
at the end of the year and that which will be passed within a week:
• $600 payments to low-income individuals, which will be increased to $2,000 in the
new bill.
• Unemployment insurance will be extended through August or September.
• $1 billion in rent relief was provided in the old bill that will be repeated in the new
bill.
• Money for SNAP and an additional $6 billion for the MTA on top of the $8 billion
that has already been provided to allow services to continue.
• $10 billion for child-care and $7 billion for broadband access, particularly for
people who currently cannot afford it.
• Lifted the ban on Pell Grant eligibility so that incarcerated people can take college
or technical courses.
• Provided $7,000 for funerals and burials for families who lost loved ones to COVID.
• There is money in the new bill for small businesses and nonprofits to get a second
round of PPE funding.
• Passed the Save Our Stages Act, which is a six-month grant for arts venues, large
and small, to stay afloat. The same is being done for restaurants. Broadway
theaters, museums, and cultural institutions will also be provided for.
• There is money in the new bill for organizations such as CDIs and MDIs that help
small businesses apply for the grants that they are entitled to but sometimes are
unable to apply for because they cannot figure out the procedure.
• $160 billion to open all schools as quickly as possible, with the goal being by
September.
Mr. Schumer noted that he and Elizebeth Warren have proposed the forgiveness of
$50,000 of student loans for the many people who are inundated with student debt. And,
because President Biden can do this with just his signature, they are trying to get 10 million
people to email the President and ask him to do that.
Once the COVID legislation is out of the way, the Senate will be focusing on three big
topics, 1) restoring the integrity of our democracy with measures such as automatic voter
registration, statehood for D.C. and Puerto Rico, a law to overcome the Citizens United
decision, and a law to get rid of gerrymandering; 2) passing a law to get rid of income
inequality by providing jobs and training for people who need a path forward, and doing
immigration reform; 3) dealing with climate change through measures such as the Thrive
Agenda that Senators Schumer and Markey have co-sponsored.
In addressing a question from a Board member, Mr. Schumer noted that funding for the
Gateway project has been in place but was held up by the Trump Administration. He is now
working with the new Transportation Secretary to get funds allocated within the next six
months. Also, the Biden Build Back Better proposal is a 2 to 4-trillion-dollar infrastructure
bill that covers big transportation projects that will be implemented in a smart and resilient
way.
Mr. Schumer concluded his appearance by answering questions about the John Lewis
Act dealing with voting rights, completing the expansion of the No. 7 Subway line, treating
pedestrian and bike lane funding as a capital expense, having Democrats accelerate the
pace of passing legislation the helps people financially and with health care, getting
support for the Port Authority Bus Terminal redevelopment project, providing funding for
internet access to poor people, regulating internet service providers, increasing funding for
senior citizens and public housing, increasing police accountability, dealing with thefilibuster in getting legislation passed, funding public education, funding cancer research,
addressing the downward trend of women in the workforce, and, making immigration
reform a priority.

Presentation: Deputy Inspector Robert W. O'Hare, Commanding Officer of the Midtown
South Precinct (West 36 Street)
Presentations /
Deputy Inspector O’Hare began his presentation with an update on an incident the
Public Hearings
previous night that involved a tourist being struck by a stray bullet near Times Square. He
stated that the fantastic work of his midnight patrol officers and the detective squad led to
a quick resolution with the arrest of the shooter at ten o’clock this morning. He was also
charged for a robbery that took place in February along the Eighth Avenue corridor.
He went on to note that Midtown South has had its challenges this past year with crime
trending in the wrong direction from this time last year when the pandemic was in its early
stages. Specifically, year-to-date robberies were up by 56 to 92, felony assaults were up
104 over 36, and burglaries were up 100 over 46 last year. These are the numbers that are
driving the overall crime rate so high. To address this, the NYPD measures crime rates in
28- and 56-day intervals to assess where resources should be deployed.
He also mentioned the horrific hate crime incident that occurred the previous week
involving a 65-year-old Filipino woman. He noted the work of his patrol officers, the Hate
Crime Task Force, and the public that led to a fairly rapid arrest of a suspect who was
recorded on surveillance video.
The Deputy Inspector responded to a question from a Board member regarding police
vehicles obstructing traffic around the Precinct on West 35th Street and near the bus stop
on Ninth Avenue. He stated that the Precinct has lost a significant number of parking spots
for its emergency response vehicles over recent years and people have been using the
spots on West 36th Street that are reserved for the Precinct. He also noted that there was
a need to keep vehicles close to the Precinct because they have been increasingly subject
to sabotage, resulting in damage to brake lines, for example. He said that kind of damage
puts everyone’s safety at risk.
Presentation: NYC Office for the Prevention of Hate Crimes
Eunice Lee, a program manager at the OPHC, began her presentation by noting that the
Office is only about two years old and was created in response to a rise in anti-Semitic hate
crime in 2018. The OPHC has elevated non-law enforcement deterrence efforts to ensure
communities most vulnerable to hate crime remain safe.
The OPHC employs two networks to achieve its goals. The first is the Interagency
Committee on Hate Crimes (IAC) which is tasked with advising the Mayor in planning and
implementing interagency coordination on preventing hate crimes. The IAC includes 18City agencies and all five District Attorney Offices, which together have been split into five
working groups. The OPHC uses a three-pillar approach consisting of community relations
through a network of 30 organizations; education by working with the DOE to design
creative youth engagement programs; and laws and law enforcement through the District
Attorneys Offices and the NYPD Hate Crime Task Force.
Ms. Lee explained the definition of a hate crime that the OPHC uses as a personal or
property-based offense that is motivated in whole or substantial part by bias towards a
person’s, group’s, or place’s perceived or actual identification with a particular identity.
She noted that hate crimes are subject to enhanced penalties because they have a
different, greater impact.
A hate crime under the New York Penal Law relates to bias motivated by identification
with the following characteristics:
• Race and color
• National origin and ancestry
• Gender and gender identity or expression
• Sexual orientation
• Religion or religious practice
• Age
• Disability
Anyone who experiences or witnesses a hate crime can call 911, file a police report, or
reach out to the DA’s Office. Survivors of hate crimes can contact a community group or
advocate to get support in their healing process. There are advocates stationed at all of the
City’s police precincts and they can make referrals for mental health assistance, financial
help, and other services. Information about the OPHC and links to resources can be found
at https://www1.nyc.gov/site/stophate/index.page
Public Session
Joli Golden Ms. Golden, a partnership specialist at the US Census Bureau, has been working with the
Board for the past two years. She noted that apportionment counts will be released on
April 30, thus setting the number of congressional representatives that New York will have
for the next ten years. She displayed the interactive census map that can be found on
census.gov and demonstrated the way one can view historical data on it. The map uses
data tabs broken down by decade, allowing the viewer to see numbers of representatives,
the population they serve, and the changes in the number of Seats from the previous
decade. Ms. Golden also spoke about Data Summits, which are the webinars that the
Census Bureau will hold beginning this month. Registration for upcoming webinars is
provided on the Bureau’s website.
Jay Li Mr. Li is a member of HackManhattan, which is a local “maker space” located at 14th
Street and Seventh Avenue. They have been open since 2011 and offer a STEM resource
to members of the community with such things as 3D printers, a machine shop, laser
cutters, and an electronic soldering workbench. The members open their space to the
public on Tuesdays. Mr. Li asked for help in finding a new venue because their building is
in the process of being sold. He also seeks funding from those who wish to support the
members in their work and the public classes they offer.
Michael Steigman Mr. Steigman is the operations manager for Down to Earth Farmers Market. The sidewalk
market is located on West 23rd Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues. The Market
operates on Saturdays and will be open from May 15 through December 18. A newfeature this season allows for pre-orders through the WhatsGood Marketplace app where
orders placed by Thursday can be picked up on Saturday.
Marni Halasa Ms. Halasa is an activist and tenant organizer who purports to represent the residents
living in the NYCHA developments in Chelsea. She stated that the residents do not want
their developments converted under the RAD or PACT programs because their tenant
protections will not follow them. She also rejected some of the information that was
presented at a NYCHA Working Group meeting that was held a few days earlier and
believes that tenants should be given more information before any conversion takes
place.
Kristen Hackett Ms. Hackett is a community organizer from the Justice for All Coalition who echoed much
of what the previous speaker had to say. She wants the Board to step back from
supporting the Working Group recommendations before an RFP is published. She added
her novel criticism that the Working Group’s process used a “power dynamic that is
Colonial in nature,” because the group consisted of a largely white group of outsiders who
were making decisions about “the future of homes and land where predominantly Black
and Brown immigrants reside.”
Anne Santore Ms. Santore spoke, as she has many times before, about the quality of life and crime in
her neighborhood in the West ’30s. She said that conditions have improved since one of
the temporary shelters was moved but worries that things might change with the coming
warmer weather. She asked the Board to take notice of the area known as “canoe park”
which is the area where the Lincoln Tunnel exits onto Dyre Avenue. She stated that the
area was starting to attract more homeless people now who make it unusable by
residents. She also noted that the drug dealers were coming back and would like to see a
police vehicle parked before the tunnel entrance to discourage that.
Lisa Wager Ms. Wager is the Director of the Office of Government Relations at the Fashion Institute
of Technology. She made the following announcements:
• FIT is hosting its 15th annual Sustainable Business and Design Conference –
Change Makers in Action – this year from April 13 through April 16 in place and as
a virtual event beginning on April 22. The Conference program will spotlight
leadership in social justice diversity, corporate responsibility, and innovation in
the fashion industry.
• Daniel Roseberry, a FIT alumnus, and current artistic director at Maison
Schiaparelli had his designs on display at the Grammy Awards where Beyonce
wore his leather mini dress and Noah Cyrus wore his “whipped cream cloud”
creation. He also designed the gown that Lady Gaga wore at President Biden’s
inauguration.
Jennifer Mallicote Ms. Mallicote complained about rampant drug dealing and usage near her residence at
21st Street and Eighth Avenue. She was especially concerned about these activities
occurring across the street from PS 11.
Susan Peters Ms. Peters expressed her concerns about the high amount of microwave radiation
emanating from the 8,000 microwave antennas on the City’s streets. She said that 4,000
more were on the way in disregard of the adverse health effects that they pose. She
blames the Mayor and the FCC.
Mary McGee Ms. McGee is a resident of the Fulton Houses and was a member of the Chelsea NYCHA
Working Group. She is also a member of the current Chelsea RFP Subcommittee. She
asked why it was still necessary for NYCHA to proceed with its PACT conversion of the
Chelsea developments now that the federal budget provides for the allocation of $40
billion for public housing.Remarks from Elected Officials and Representatives
Congressman Congressman Nadler provided the following updates:
Jerrold Nadler • President Biden signed the historic $1.9 billion American Rescue Plan in March and
already people are seeing the benefits. It provides a third round of $1,400 stimulus
payments with Social Security and other federal beneficiaries seeing direct
deposits and/or mail checks this week. It also extends unemployment insurance,
pandemic employment assistance, and federal supplemental benefits through
September 6. It cuts child poverty in half by expanding the earned income tax
credit and the child tax credit.
• The American Rescue Plan also bolsters housing assistance to an additional $21.5
billion in emergency rental assistance on top of the $25 billion that was secured in
December for renters currently struggling to pay rent or are not up to date on their
rent payments because of the pandemic. In New York State these funds will be
administered through the office of Temporary Disability Assistance.
• Further, the Rescue Plan provides $25 billion for a newly-created program offering
up to $10 million in direct grants to restaurants and other foodservice
establishments and $1.25 billion in additional funding for the Shuttered Venue
Operators grants. The Small Business Administration will begin accepting
applications tomorrow; applications and eligibility information can be found on the
SBA website.
• The American Rescue Plan includes funding to expand the Affordable Care Act for
the first time since it was enacted 11 years ago. It delivers much-needed funds to
state and local governments, including $24 billion for New York.
• The next phase of the administration’s Build Back Better Plan is the American Jobs
Plan that was released last week. This ambitious $2 trillion infrastructure bill
contains robust funding necessary to overhaul the country's crumbling
infrastructure. It includes $621 billion to fix highways and bridges, upgrade ports
and airports and another $85 billion for modernizing existing transit systems.
• Because climate change poses a looming threat to our infrastructure systems, Mr.
Nadler helped lead the effort to push the administration to ensure that large-scale
climate resiliency and flood protection investments were included in the
infrastructure package. Among many other provisions, the infrastructure bill also
includes investing $40 billion to address long-standing public housing capital needs
and improve the infrastructure of the public housing system across the country.
• Some of the other legislation that Mr. Nadler is working on includes the SALT
Deductibility Act which seeks to restore full state and local tax deduction on
taxpayer’s federal income tax returns. He also reintroduced the African Burial
Ground International Memorial Museum and Education Center Act.
Congresswoman Congresswoman Maloney gave these updates:
Carolyn Maloney • She noted that a $356 billion portion of the infrastructure legislation went through
the House Oversight Committee, the committee that she chairs. Those funds are
meant for cities, states, territories, and tribes. It turned out to be the most
contentious part of the bill because Republicans were against that and they held
up the vote early in the proceedings. But New York City ended up getting $5.9
billion for their priorities and the state got $12 billion. Overall, $100 billion will be
coming to the City and State of New York. This, of course, is much needed for the
area that was the epicenter of the COVID virus.• Ms. Maloney worked with the Mayor and Councilman Kalos to ensure that part of
the City’s money would go to funding pre-K for three-year-old children. This is
important for their development and their parents, as well, because 11 million
women and 9 million men lost their jobs during the pandemic due to their having
to stay home to care for their children and become their teachers.
• She has worked on a helicopter noise bill for many years, and it has always been
the case that the FAA says it is their role to increase helicopter flights, not decrease
them. She is therefore no longer working with them. Instead, she is working with
the chairman of the Transportation Committee to have non-essential flights over
the City of New York added to the bill we wrote.
• After trying for twenty years, she passed a bill to build a Women’s Museum on the
Capitol Mall across from the African American Museum. She noted that the
museum was seeking applicants for its advisory board and that she would support
anyone who applies from our community.
• Ms. Maloney is going to introduce a bill that will forgive the student loans of
frontline workers in healthcare. While she supports such a measure for all students
who have become burdened with student loans, she believes that those in
healthcare deserve it most after sacrificing so much during the pandemic.
• She referred to her website for more details on the American Jobs Plan:
Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney | Representing the 12th District of New York
(house.gov) The next step in the Plan is infrastructure funding and she is pushing to
have the entire fleet of US Post Office trucks become electric and to have postal
centers across the nation equipped with plugins so that the public can go there to
plug in with their electric cars. She is also pushing for high-speed rail service from
New York to Boston to grow the economy more quickly, as analysts have predicted.
Her efforts will also continue with the completion of the Second Avenue Subway –
having it run from Harlem to the tip of Manhattan.
• Ms. Maloney has worked hard in her committee to get funding for community
health centers in her district. She got over $4 million for the floating hospital, $2
million for care for the homeless, $2.2 million for the Community Health Network
in Manhattan, and $9 million for the New York City Health and Hospitals
Corporation.
• She noted that she agrees with the previous speakers about NYCHA issues and
added that she also supports the Green New Deal for public housing.
Senator Robert Senator Jackson gave the following monthly updates:
Jackson • After concluding budget negotiations with the Governor earlier in the day, people
are generally pleased with the outcome. An example of what was achieved
compared to last year’s process is an agreement on the foundation aid formula
that gives every school district an additional 2% of foundation aid.
• The success that all of the elected officials from the district had in dealing with the
Empire Station Complex was the result of all of them coming together against the
Governor at a time when he had numerous other issues to deal with.
• He will send a 39-page list to the Board outlining the finer points of the budget,
including items such as casinos, sports betting, excluded workers, circuit breakers,
and small business.
• Mr. Jackson stated that his priorities as a legislator were education, food insecurity,
universal health coverage, and mental health issues. He will be back in Albany on
April 19 after a weeklong break to wrap up business by the end of June.Borough President The Borough President presented a virtual proclamation to Martin Treat, a longtime
Gale Brewer member of the Board, commemorating his life of service as a Viet Nam War veteran, actor,
playwright, community activist, and theater arts teacher. He was also elected to the New
York State Veterans Hall of Fame and is the founder of the Clinton-Hell’s Kitchen Coalition
for Pedestrian Safety.
Ms. Brewer went on to provide her monthly updates:
• She spoke of the Asian-American woman, Vilma Kari, who was attacked in front of
a residential building on West 43rd Street, and how that particular hate crime
instilled fear in many New Yorkers. She thanked the NYPD for arresting the
perpetrator and the owner of the building for his assistance.
• She commended Dick Gottfried, Liz Kruger, and the entire New York delegation for
preventing the plan for a casino in Manhattan from going forward. Especially now,
people should be spending their money at our theaters and restaurants, not at
casinos.
• It was a big win for the district when the Governor’s Empire Station Complex plan
was modified in the state budget, requiring all funds to be used for improving Penn
Station.
• Six new elevators are going to be installed on West 14th Street between Seventh
and Eighth Avenues thanks to money coming from the MTA, the federal
infrastructure budget, and lawsuits.
• She supports the businesses on Restaurant Row that want to make it a permanent
pedestrian plaza. She also supports the federal legislation that would ban non-
essential helicopter flights over Manhattan.
• There is going to be a Veterans Treatment Court established in Manhattan now
that the state has agreed to provide funding.
Assemblymember Ms. Rosenthal took time away from voting on the state budget to provide updates:
Linda Rosenthal • She and Senator Schumer are holding a virtual Town Hall on Sunday, April 11 at 4
pm to review and discuss the new federal and state budgets.
• She noted that Steve Kroman, the landlord who went to prison for committing
tenant harassment, tax fraud, and mortgage fraud, still owes $8 million in
restitution to tenants. He claimed in a court filing that COVID-related losses have
prevented him from making payments, but it appears that the vacancies he cited
actually existed before the pandemic. Ms. Rosenthal has requested an audit by
HCR to refute this.
• She has been working with the residents of Hell’s Kitchen on sanitation issues and
noted, in particular, the Litter Legion volunteer group and Erik Bottcher who has
been devoting a lot of time cleaning up the neighborhood. She noted her
testimony at the City’s budget hearings which led to the restoration of DSNY
funding in the budget. As a result, the City has resumed Sunday pick-ups and added
100 more trucks per week for increased litter basket service.
• There are a lot of good things in the state budget so far, including no tuition
increases for SUNY and CUNY students; payment of one-third of what has been
owed to the Campaign for Fiscal Equity for many years; big increases in foundation
aid; closing the TAP gap by giving a $500 bump up for every student who is eligible
for TAP; a rent relief program for tenants and landlords who have been affected by
the pandemic with priorities for small landlords and low-income tenants; $2.1
billion to be distributed across the state to people who did not get any financial aid
during the past year; raised the personal income tax rate for millionaires; $100
million for homeless people to secure housing; and $250 million for NYCHA that
will be added to the funding expected from the federal government.• Ms. Rosenthal will be hosting Shred Day with Senator Serrano in front of her office
on May 23 from 10 am to 2 pm.
Luke Wolf for Mr. Wolf referred to the Comptroller’s community newsletter that can be viewed at
Comptroller Scott https://comptroller.nyc.gov/newsroom/spring-2021-community-newsletter/
Stringer He went on to announce that the DOE will not require schools to return funds that were
allocated to them before the pandemic caused decreased enrollment. This would normally
have occurred as part of the midyear budget adjustment and would have resulted in
schools losing thousands of dollars of needed funds.
The Comptroller’s office conducted a workplace survey of over 1,200 New Yorkers about
their work-life balance during the pandemic. It revealed that frontline workers, women,
and people of color suffered disproportionally during the pandemic. For example, a woman
who had to care for someone at home had a 50% chance of having to cut back on paid
work hours. That speaks to a lack of workplace flexibility and child-care options. The
Comptroller has offered several recommendations to improve workplace flexibility for the
frontline workers who were there for us during the pandemic.
Last month, the Comptroller released a report to address food insecurity in the City. He
requested that a $25 million fund be created for those who were left out of SNAP and
called for expansion of other food security programs.
Matt Tighe for Mr. Tighe provided the following updates on the current budget negotiations in Albany:
Assemblymember • Mr. Gottfried, along with other elected officials, was able to restrict the use of $1.3
Dick Gottfried billion in the state budget to only below-grade transportation improvements in the
Governor’s Empire Station Complex proposal. It negated plans to level the area
around Penn Station for as many as 10 new buildings that would have
overshadowed much of the neighborhood. This was not a plan to rebuild our
transportation infrastructure; this was a real estate proposal and was
unacceptable.
• The Legislature also blocked the Governor’s proposal that would have allowed a
casino to be built in Manhattan and the local zoning overrides that he wanted,
which are the subject of the Board’s letter in Agenda Item 1.
• The new budget also includes $1 billion for small business and arts relief and
recovery assistance. This includes a small business recovery grant program, a
restaurant resiliency grant program, and other programs that focus just on arts and
cultural organizations. There is also a provision for a $100 million tax credit for
New York City musical and theatrical production. All of this will go a long way to
jumpstart the industry that was hurt so much over the past year.
• On education funding, there are going to be some of the biggest gains seen in a
very long time with local school boards getting a $3 billion increase over the last
fiscal year. There has been a long fight to get this extra foundation aid in and it is
due in large part to Senator Jackson’s work and advocacy.
• There is now a two-year tuition freeze for all students at SUNY and CUNY schools.
• In the healthcare portion of the budget, this is the first time since
Assemblymember Gottfried has become chair of the Health Committee that we
have fought back every single cut that a governor has proposed. So, whether it’s
Governor Cuomo or any other governor, they always try to chip into Medicaid. The
Governor tried to cut Medicaid by $415 million and cut $600 million in hospital
funding. We also delayed the carve-out for Medicare prescription drug benefits for
two years; expanded postpartum coverage for women on Medicaid from 60 daysto one year, and now nursing homes will be required to spend 70% of their
revenue on direct patient care.
• Last week, New York legalized marijuana. The Marijuana Regulation and Taxation
Act will create new economic opportunities and focuses revenue on communities
that have been hardest hit by the war on drugs. New York is projected to collect
new revenue of about $350 million a year and it is expected to generate between
30 and 60 thousand jobs.
Carl Wilson for Mr. Wilson noted that the Speaker’s office is working with the anti-violence project and is
Council Speaker putting together a bystander training that some people expressed an interest in this
Corey Johnson evening. May 19 is a tentative date and when it is finalized, he will come back to the Board.
The Speaker’s office will host Spring Parks Cleanup day in each of the parks in our district
on April 18 from 12 to 2 pm. Volunteers can join their neighbors and work with Parks and
Sanitation Department workers who will distribute tools and equipment.
About a week and a half ago, the Mayor announced some restorations to the Sanitation
budget, which includes more litter basket services and more trucks in Manhattan
Community District 4. We will be getting 6 more vehicles to add to our existing 12 vehicles
for litter basket services as well as 2 more vehicles for Sunday litter basket services. We will
also be getting some borough-based strike teams to deal with sanitation hotspots.
The Speaker has been working for almost three years on getting a scaffold removed from
Mathews-Palmer Playground and now it appears that the work can commence on fixing
the wall of a Co-Op building that is responsible for the scaffold. Unfortunately, the scope of
that work does not include restoring the mural on the damaged wall. A committee has
been formed to deal with that issue.
Board Reports & Business
Adoption of Agenda and The Agenda and March minutes were unanimously approved.
Minutes

underwear to families, single adults, children, and single parents living in
local homeless shelters.• The Ryan Health Center is looking for volunteers to help administer COVID
Vaccinations. They are looking for Registered Nurses (RN), Licensed
Practical Nurses (LPN), Physicians, NPs, PAs, Dentists, and other licensed
healthcare providers.
Contact: volunteer@ryancenter.org
• We have enhanced the number of ways the public can sign up for the
public session. It can be done on our homepage or calendar page, on our
Zoom registration page, and the Zoom registration confirmation email. It
can also be done on the Full Board Agenda PDF.
• Board staff will begin returning to the office on May 3 and we will be
drafting a reopening plan during April.
April Committee Updates and Board Reminders:
• The WPE Committee will be meeting tomorrow, the day after the Full
Board Meeting.
• All other committees meet at their regular time.
• The Social and Racial Justice Task Force meets on its usual third Tuesday of
the month.
Small Meetings in March:
Board Chair Report
• Transportation Committee met with Target regarding delivery operations
at the West 44th and 10th Avenue store. This resulted in an administrative
letter being sent to Target because they are parking their trucks
everywhere that they are not supposed to park.
• As was mentioned earlier, Housing, Health & Human Services met with the
Ryan Health Center and Project Find to organize a vaccination day at
Harborview Terrace.
• EXEC Leadership and CHKLU attended an initial briefing on the Highline
East Project with Friends of the Highline and ESD.
• The Empire Station Complex Working Group has been meeting and, as of
today, has been reformulated to add more staff. Because state budget
money has been restricted for the Plan, we will have more of a say on it
and expect it to be our next big project.

Presentation: NYC Campaign Finance Board on Ranked Choice Voting
Allie Swatek, the Director of Policy and Research at the Campaign Finance Board, gave
Presentations /
an overview of the ranked choice voting process. She explained that it would be used for
Public Hearings
the first time Citywide in the June 22 primary election for city offices and that it would not
be extended to either state or federal elections. Neither would it be used for local races
like district attorneys or judgeships. It allows voters to rank up to five candidates in order
of preference, instead of just one. Ranked Choice Voting came about via a ballot question
created by the 2019 Charter Revision Commission; it received a 73.5% YES vote by New
York City voters.
Ms. Swatek demonstrated the proper way to fill in a ballot and noted that voters should
take care not to rank a candidate more than once and not to assign more than one
candidate the same rank. Such ballots will be rejected by a ballot scanner during in-person
voting but will be a problem for absentee voters. A winning candidate is one who receives
more than 50% of first-choice votes. If no candidate receives more than 50% of first-choice
votes, then counting will continue in rounds that result in the candidate with the least
number of votes being eliminated. The process continues until there are only two
candidates left and, the one with the most votes, wins.
The Campaign Finance Board will partner with Borough President Brewer on a training
panel on Tuesday, May 11 from 6:30 – 8:00 pm.
Presentation: Land Use Application for The Windermere – 400 W. 57th Street
J.D. Noland, the Chair of the Clinton/Hell’s Kitchen Land Use Committee, explained the
application which is the subject of Agenda Item 1. The Windermere is a landmarked
building located at the corner of Ninth Avenue and West 57th Street that was built in 1882.
The owner of the building is seeking waivers that will allow its restoration and conversion
into either a hotel or other commercial use, all subject to a cure imposed by HPD requiring
the inclusion of affordable housing.
No one from the public came forward to speak, so the hearing was closed.Public Session
Lisa Wager Ms. Wager is the Director of the Office of Government Relations at the Fashion Institute
of Technology. She made the following announcements:
• FIT has won a third consecutive award from the National Endowment for the Arts
of $25,000 for STEM education to support sustainable programming through
2021.
• The Annual School of Art and Design graduating student exhibition will go online
on May 10. It presents the jury-award-winning and thesis project work of more
than 500 student graduates in 16 areas of study, such as toy design, interior
design, footwear and accessories design, packaging design, jewelry design,
animation and interactive game design, and fashion design.
• The FIT bachelor’s degree Fashion Design Runway Show will go online on May 17.
The show gets international media attention every year and, this year, it is
accessible on the FIT website at https://www.fitnyc.edu/
Brian Weber Mr. Weber spoke on behalf of the newly-constituted Midtown South Community Council.
Its first meeting was held on April 27 and, going forward, meetings will be held on the
fourth Tuesday of every month via Zoom.
Caitlin Ervin Ms. Ervin is a staff associate with the New York State Nurses Association who works at Mt.
Sinai West. She spoke about the addiction unit at her hospital being closed since January
due to the pandemic and asked the Board to support her efforts in getting it reopened.
She was advised to work with CB4 staff and the Housing, Health & Human Services
Committee in that regard.
Jennifer Mallicote Ms. Mallicote complained that she, as a member of the Midtown South Community
Council before its recent reorganization, was not notified about the formation of a new
group that would usurp hers as the new Community Council. She was advised to follow
the process that was explained to the previous speaker and begin by communicating with
CB4 staff.
Remarks from Elected Officials and Representatives
Senator Brad Senator Hoylman provided the following updates:
Hoylman • He introduced legislation along with Assemblymember Gottfried called the Empire
Station Complex Public Review Act. It would require that all land use decisions
regarding the Complex be subject to the City’s ULURP process, the same review
process that all city agencies must adhere to when acquiring property and siting
capital projects. The Act would cover the Governor’s proposal to demolish full city
blocks and build 10 high-rise buildings on the vacated property. Community Boards
4 and 5 will thus have a say on matters related to the project.
• He held a Townhall with Assemblymember Rosenthal and Dr. Peter Marks who is
the gatekeeper at the FDA for COVID-19 vaccines and the final sign-off for
approval. The biggest takeaway from the event is that the currently approved
vaccines work to protect against all known variants of the virus.• He and ten Senate colleagues sent a letter to the management of the Metropolitan
Opera asking that they come to an agreement with backstage workers and
musicians who are currently locked out over contract disputes.
• He introduced a bill that was passed in the Senate that would require state agency
websites to be translated for non-English speakers. It calls for translation of the top
twelve languages spoken by New York State residents, many of whom have been
disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 crisis.
• The eviction moratorium that was passed earlier this session has been extended
for both evictions and foreclosures until August 31. Efforts have now begun to
distribute as soon as possible the $2.4 billion that was provided in the budget for
emergency rental and utility assistance for income-eligible renters and commercial
tenants.
• Another important bill that Mr. Hoylman passed through committee is the
Manhattan Mom and Pop Tax Relief Act. The bill is going to suspend the collection
of a very unfair tax on our small businesses called the Commercial Rent Tax. The
tax is only applied to businesses south of 96th Street in Manhattan because it was
repealed everywhere else.
• The Senator thanked his colleagues for their work on the budget and especially in
getting an increase of $3.1 billion for aid to public schools.
• There is a doubling in the budget for the New York City musical and theatrical
production tax credit from $50 million, which the Governor proposed, to $100
million. The budget also includes an $800 million small business recovery grant
program to assist small businesses that were affected by state-mandated
lockdowns during the pandemic. The legislature also passed a $25 million
restaurant resiliency grant program and a $35 million restaurant return-to-work
tax credit.
Congresswoman Congresswoman Maloney gave these updates:
Carolyn Maloney • She spoke about being one of the few guests at President Biden’s joint address to
Congress and was thrilled to have a President who could deliver $1.9 trillion to the
country through the American Rescue Plan. Most importantly, he focused on
vaccinations; he had promised to have 100 million people vaccinated in his first
100 days and he surpassed that to 220 million. By the end of May, there are going
to be enough doses to vaccinate everyone. There is funding now for pop-up
vaccination centers, not only at hospital centers but community health centers as
well.
• The economy is picking up. The current GDP growth rate for the first quarter is
6.4% -- the highest it's been since she has been in office and is usually around the
3% rate.
• On the American Rescue Plan, Ms. Maloney chaired the committee that oversaw
$255 billion that went to cities and states in a manner that allowed for flexibility.
This is the area where Democrats and Republicans fought the most, with
Republicans not wanting to give any money to cities and states. When you
combine everything that includes direct grants, the unemployment subsidy, the
money for the MTA and small businesses, the PPP grants, and the money to help
renters stay in their homes, that comes out to roughly $100 billion to New York
State alone.
• Coming up next is the American Jobs Plan that deals with the infrastructure that
needs repair. It’s something that everyone always talks about but is now hoped will
finally be passed.• There is also the American Families Plan which will invest in our kids and our
families, which Ms. Maloney has been fighting for during her entire career. The
American Families Plan is a once-in-a-generation investment in the foundations of
middle-class prosperity, education, healthcare, and childcare. For the first time,
federal money will fund Pre-K for 3- and 4-year-old children across all of the City’s
five boroughs.
• Within the American Jobs Plan, Ms. Maloney is pushing for an extension of the
Second Avenue Subway up to 125th Street and, eventually, all the way down to the
tip of Manhattan. Part of the $3 billion in the Plan would go to connecting the LIRR
to Grand Central and making upgrades to the Terminal itself. She is also pushing for
high-speed rail service between New York and Boston.
• Ms. Maloney has been working on a bill for years that would ban all non-essential
helicopter flights over New York City airspace.
• Tomorrow, Ms. Maloney will chair a hearing on Black maternal health. Black
women are three times more likely than white women to die in childbirth. She has
a slew of initiatives and ideas on how to address this and make it happen.
• Next week, she is chairing an oversight hearing on the January Sixth attack on the
Capitol, where two major former Trump appointees will testify. The following day,
there will be a hearing on the Post Office where the financial problems that they
are confronting will be addressed.
Emily Bartosek for Ms. Bartosek gave the following updates:
Assemblymember • Ms. Rosenthal and Senator Serrano will be hosting a Shred Day Event on May 23 in
Linda Rosenthal front of our district office on West 72nd Street from 10 am to 2 pm.
• Our office has begun receiving an influx of calls again about unemployment issues.
The Department of Labor has put out a lot of mixed and confusing messaging
about who needs to reapply at the end of their benefit year. So, we've been
hearing from a lot of constituents that their benefits paused around March and
that the DOL has to reset their accounts. We have asked the DOL to correct these
issues
• We also recently wrote a letter to Con Edison after we learned about a building
where tenants have been without gas since October. There has been a gas repair
that needs to be done, but Con Ed has been charging constituents $30 a month for
a service fee. Con Ed claims that there is a policy that they follow that requires this
and we, therefore, asked that this absurd policy be eliminated, and the impacted
tenants are given a refund.
Borough President The Borough President provided her monthly updates:
Gale Brewer • She has had two press conferences recently about the City refusing to open senior
centers while it has opened other venues, such as gyms, restaurants, museums,
movie theaters, and coffee shops. Seniors have been clamoring to get back into
these vital facilities and she is not giving up trying to make that happen.
• Her office has been working with the Board and others to resolve some of the
public safety issues in the district but still has not been advised by the Department
of Homeless Services as to when the temporary hotel shelters will be closed. She
noted that the Mayor’s Business District Recovery Initiative may improve public
safety, but it does not include community stakeholders, including CB4.
• She noted the increase in anti-Asian hate crimes around the City, including the
ones on West 43rd Street and in front of Manhattan Plaza. Ms. Brewer is
advocating for more funding and volunteer aid for the groups that support theAsian community. The office has sent letters to the Port Authority and hotels in the
area seeking their help as well.
• Ms. Brewer complimented the Board for its work on the Empire Station Complex
and is pleased that the Governor has finally gotten the message about our
community’s concerns. She added that the inclusion of open public space in the
project is something that must be kept in mind.
• She and Councilmember Rosenthal have introduced a bill regarding empty
storefronts that includes mediation and is thus different from the ones that have
been pending for the last 30 years.
• There have been ongoing meetings every Tuesday at 3 pm concerning the issue of
when stores and restaurants should be allowed to reopen. Most recently, the topic
of liquor licenses was discussed as it relates to the amount of time it takes for the
SLA to issue a liquor license after community board consideration. She asked that
we seek clarification from the SLA on the reasons for its six-month lag time.
• There is a big push for having as many high school graduations this year as possible
and she complimented the Intrepid Museum for making its space available.
• Ms. Brewer will be hosting an information session with the Campaign Finance
Board on Tuesday, May 11 from 6:30-8:00 pm on ranked choice voting. Register at
bit.ly/RCVManahattanInfo.
Phillip Ellison for Mr. Ellison stated that he was attending the meeting only as an observer but was available
Public Advocate for questions.

Presentation: Deputy Inspector Hellman regarding the NYPD Business District Recovery
Initiative Detail
Presentations /
D.I. Hellman is assigned to Manhattan South with the task of overseeing the Business
Public Hearings
District Recovery Detail. The unit began operations on April 18 with 30 officers and now
has 2 lieutenants, 7 sergeants, and 80 officers. The unit is expected to grow based on its
record of success and increased concern about quality-of-life issues. Those concerns are
compounding with the City’s reopening and more people going back to work.
The quality-of-life issues that the unit was tasked to address include vagrants with
obvious mental health conditions committing random acts of violence, low-level narcotics
use, aggressive panhandling, and illegal vending. D.I. Hellman’s approach to dealing with
these issues has been to have more officers seen out on the streets in the Midtown zone
that goes from Fifth Avenue to Tenth Avenue and 34th Street to 59th Street. The unit also
partners with DHS, the Department of Sanitation, the Department of Health and Hospitals,
the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, community boards, and local
officials. Officers often go out with DHS, and Health and Hospitals clinicians to identify their
clients for mental health and hygiene removals. They also work with DHS in removing
encampments and property from sidewalks.
Public Hearing: Land Use Application for 495 11th Avenue – Slaughterhouse – Mixed-Use
Affordable Housing Development
The Chair opened the hearing for comments from the public on Agenda Item 1. No one
from the public came forward to speak, so the hearing was closed.
Public Hearing: City-Wide Zoning for Accessibility Text Amendment Application
Paul Devlin, Co-Chair of the Chelsea Land Use Committee, explained the letter that is
the subject of Agenda Item 5. Miriam Fisher, a member of the public, spoke on behalf of
herself and other people with disabilities who require accessible access to the subway
system and called upon the MTA to fulfill its obligations under the Americans with
Disabilities Act by installing elevators at every MTA station.
Public Hearing: City-Wide Hotel Special Permit ApplicationBetty Mackintosh, Co-Chair of the Chelsea Land Use Committee, explained the letter
that is the subject of Agenda Item 2. No one from the public came forward to speak, so the
hearing was closed.
Public Session
Winnifred Lee Ms. Lee, who works with GrowNYC Greenmarkets, announced the opening of the farmers
market at West 57th Street and 10th Avenue outside of Starbucks. The market is open on
Wednesdays and Saturdays from 8am to 5pm.
Thomas Lunke Mr. Lunke is a former member of the Board and an urban planner. He spoke in favor of
landmarking former Colored School No.4 at 128 West 17th Street, as requested by award-
winning historian and author Eric Washington. He also supports this request going before
the Chelsea Land Use Committee for a more detailed and inclusive discussion of this
Reconstruction-era racial caste public school.
Eric Washington Mr. Washington spoke about his request to have Colored School No. 4 – later known as
Grammar School 81 – designated an individual landmark by the LPC. He noted that the
school was one of the most renowned racial caste schools that the board of education
maintained for African American children. The Department of Sanitation has administered
the building for public use over the past century. He recounted the status of his request to
LPC that was filed in 2018 and asked that the Board assist in getting it moved along. He
was advised by the Chair that the matter would be on the Chelsea Land Use agenda next
month.
Bobby Robaina Mr. Robaina works in the Office of Government Relations at the Fashion Institute of
Technology. He made the following announcements:
• On May 19, FIT posted the Annual Future of Fashion Showcase with nearly 200
senior thesis collections from the class of 2021 Fashion Design BFA program.
Traditionally presented in a runway show, the designs can be viewed through
digital portfolios inclusive of sketches, photography, and personal statements at
https://fashionshow.fitnyc.edu/ The website also features a 23-minute video
called Runway from Home.
• Lenny Vuitton, a recent MFA in Design graduate, is an emerging artist
participating in the Emerging Designer Residency at the Shops of Hudson Yards.
His workshop will be open on Level 4 until June 30, 2021.
Mike LeDonne Mr. LeDonne is the president of Disability Pride NYC and the founder of the Disability
Pride Parade in New York City. His young daughter uses a wheelchair when they travel
around the City, and they cite the lack of sufficient curb cuts as their greatest impediment
in getting from block to block. He asked the Board for advice on how to get action from
City officials on this and other transportation issues. He was advised by the First Vice Chair
to contact the District Manager who would then forward his request to the Transportation
Committee so that it could be included in the next meeting agenda.
Carl Wilson Mr. Wilson has served Council Speaker Johnson as his liaison to the Board for the past
three and a half years. He announced his decision to move on to pursue other personal
goals and thanked the Board for the opportunity to work together on community issues.
He introduced Britanny Bowen as his replacement and stated that she would be speakinglater in the meeting. The Chair and several other Board members thanked Mr. Wilson for
his extensive service.
Leslie Thrope Ms. Thrope is the Executive Director of Housing Conservation Coordinators. She
announced that applications for the Emergency Rental Assistance Program were now
online, and she implored everyone to reach out to their neighbors with help in taking
advantage of this benefit. She suggested the best way to accomplish that would be to
download a flyer from the Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance website and
distribute it to those who may have fallen behind in their rent during the pandemic. This is
the link to that site: https://otda.ny.gov/programs/Emergency-Rental-Assistance/
Eligibility criteria are set forth on the website, as are the household prioritization
guidelines for families that are most in need. Applicants may apply for 12 months of rental
arrears, 3 months of future arrears, and 12 months of utility payments. There are no
immigration status requirements to qualify for the program.
James Wallace Mr. Wallace, who is a member of the Board, spoke for himself when he encouraged
everyone to get out and vote in the June 22 primary election. He reminded everyone that
ranked choice voting would be used for the first time in a City election.
Marni Halasa Ms. Halasa spoke about pushing for passage of the Small Business Jobs Survival Act for the
past four years, and that it is legislation that has been languishing in the City Council for
over thirty years. It would ensure that rent for a City commercial space would not
skyrocket when the lease for that space ends. The bill levels the playing field between the
business owner and landlord so landlords would not have all the power in lease
negotiations, which is a dynamic of property rights that is desperately needed. She
encourages the next Council member who is elected in the district to support this bill and
asked for the Board’s support as well.
Evan Haymes Mr. Haymes introduced himself as part of the management and ownership of 5 Penn
Plaza, a building located at the corner of West 34th Street and Eighth Avenue. He noted
that there were normally 4000 people in the office building and that there are only 127
now. He stated that he was excited about the DOT’s plans to beautify the area around the
building and that he had conveyed that to Christine Berthet, Co-Chair of the
Transportation Committee, who invited him to speak at the meeting. He further stated
that he was staggered by the results of the “magnificent” Moynahan Train Hall which was
a public-private partnership that he has been working on and off at 5 Penn Plaza.
Mr. Haymes wanted to be sure that the Board was aware of the concerns of those at 5
Penn Plaza regarding the DOT’s plans to move the bike station from across the street in
front of Duane Reade to the West side of Eighth Avenue along the entire 200-foot block
front of 5 Penn. This would pose a fire safety hazard and impede emergency personnel
from accessing the building, specifically, for those wishing to access CityMD, which is the
urgent care provider located at the center of the block. CityMD is used by a large
population of residents and workers for emergencies and regular office visits. During a
year, emergency workers move stretchers hundreds of times to and from the urgent care
facility.
Remarks from Elected Officials and RepresentativesBorough President Ms. Brewer provided the following updates:
Gale Brewer • The police precincts and the Board have done a commendable job dealing with
public safety issues in the district but there is an outstanding problem that needs
to be addressed. When individuals are taken to a hospital for a 72-hour evaluation,
they are often released back into the community without any options for human
services and support. The Midtown Court has an array of services to offer but they
are never connected to the people who need them.
• The office has been working on finding ways for street vendors and the community
to work together, especially in the area around Hudson Yards.
• The office has been fighting against a huge rent increase at Clinton Towers, one of
the few Mitchell-Lama rentals in the Borough of Manhattan.
• Ms. Brewer has been working with the Asian American Federation on some PSAs to
combat Asian hate in the City.
• Ms. Brewer wrote a letter about dirt bikes and ATVs, and shortly thereafter the
NYPD had a press conference on the topic.
• Council Member Helen Rosenthal and Ms. Brewer introduced a bill regarding open
storefronts that is a little different from the pending Small Business Jobs Survival
Act. It would require landlords and tenants to have meaningful talks about lease
renewals.
• After starting the discussion about opening senior centers, Ms. Brewer is pleased
to hear that the Mayor is planning to do so this month.
Britanny Bowen Ms. Bowen announced 3 upcoming events:
for Speaker Corey • Ranked choice voting training will be held on June 3 from 6 to 8pm. Those wishing
Johnson to attend should email the office at speakerjohnson@council.nyc.gov.
• An E-Waste recycling event will be held at Manhattan Plaza on Saturday, June 5
from 10am to 4pm. Drop-offs can be made on 43rd Street between 9th and 10th
Avenues.
• A virtual Rat Academy event will be held on Thursday, June 10 from 5 to 7pm. The
trainings are for building supers, maintenance personnel, management companies,
and residents. Sign up via the office email address to receive a Zoom link.
Matt Tighe for Mr. Tighe gave the following updates:
Assemblymember • The Emergency Rental Assistance Program is a $2.3 billion fund. Those in need
Dick Gottfried should apply quickly because there a lot of people who need this aid across the
state. The Assemblymember’s office staff will help anyone who asks for help
applying.
• There are recovery grants for small businesses, as well as arts and cultural
organizations that were passed in the budget. These grants could be used to cover
various business costs that were incurred between March 1 of last year and April 1
of this year. This includes payroll, rent, mortgage payments, any property school
taxes, insurance, and any pandemic-related expenditures that were necessary.
• Last month in Albany, both the Assembly and Senate passed the START Act, which
is the Survivors of Trafficking Attaining Relief Together Act that was sponsored by
Mr. Gottfried in the Assembly and Jessica Ramos in the Senate. The bill increases
protections for survivors of human trafficking, including sex and labor trafficking,
by allowing them to clear the convictions that were related to their exploitation.
Under the current law, survivors are only able to petition a court to clear
convictions for prostitution, but not other offenses into which they were coercedto commit by their traffickers. This bill changes that and is going to the Governor
for his signature.
• Support has also consolidated in both Houses for a bill that Mr. Gottfried
introduced in the Assembly. It would lower the allowable level of lead in the
drinking water in schools all across New York State and will require testing every
three years. It sets way tighter standards for the level at which school districts
would be required to take remediation steps to remove lead in the drinking water.
• Mr. Gottfried has three bills that he hopes to get passed during the final two weeks
of the session. One is for the expansion of Medicaid for pregnant women beyond
the current 60-day limit to one year after pregnancy to reduce maternal mortality
and morbidity. Another bill would cap medical debt interest, and a third bill would
require health care providers who administer immunizations to report those
records to the Department of Health or regional health organizations.
Leslie Espaillat for Ms. Espaillat provided these updates from the Senator’s office:
Senator Robert • It is important that the word is spread about the Emergency Rental Assistance
Jackson Program to community organizations and tenant groups so that people who
cannot find rent money elsewhere can obtain a grant that does not have to be paid
back. The office has already helped numerous families in the district and will
continue to do so in the coming weeks.
• The Senator has been working on several bills in the Senate:
o S1991 to end qualified immunity for law enforcement officers that allows
them to escape accountability for harm done to citizens and for violation
of their rights.
o S6296 regarding education funding for smaller classes.
o The New York Health Act, which would establish a single payer system that
would provide universal health care for all New Yorkers.
• The Senator’s food pantry has been operating for the past two months and will
finalize its partnership with West Side Against Hunger by the end of June.
• Constituents in the district are urged to call the office if they need assistance with
unemployment or any other issues, such as utility bills or medical care. There are
several experts in the office who can make referrals to an agency or organization,
and to a pro bono lawyer as well.

Public Hearing: City Wide Text Amendment for Permanent Open Restaurants
JD Noland, Chair of the Clinton/Hell’s Kitchen Land Use Committee, conducted the
hearing on Agenda Item 28 relating to the proposal by DCP to make the Open Restaurants
Program permanent. He stated that the committee rejected the three text amendments
that were proposed by DCP because they would remove all protections that zoning
provides now for outdoor cafes. A written statement opposing the proposal that was
submitted by a local resident was read aloud and two members of the public spoke in
person:
• Catie Savage stated that she was generally in favor of outdoor dining, but that the
proposal needed modifications to provide for more regulation of restaurant
business operations and sanitation planning by the City.
• Pamela Wolf, who is a public member of the Board, spoke for herself as a resident
of Chelsea. She voiced her concern that the proposal would perpetuate the
shortcomings of the current Open Restaurants Program that are mainly due to a
lack of enforcement by the City of rules governing outdoor space boundaries, for
example.
Public Hearing: City-Wide Text Amendment for Health and Fitness
Paul Devlin, Co-Chair of the Chelsea Land Use Committee, conducted the hearing on
Agenda Item 30, which is a ratification of a letter that had already been sent to the DCP
approving the proposal to remove the requirement that Physical Culture Establishments
obtain a special permit from the Bureau of Standards and Appeals. With no public speakers
coming forward, the hearing was closed.
Public Hearing: Western Rail Yard Infrastructure Project Draft Environmental Impact
Statement Comment Period
JD Noland conducted the hearing on Agenda Item 29. There were no public speakers, so
the hearing was closed.
Public Hearing: Starrett-Lehigh Building (601 West 26th Street) and Terminal Warehouse
Building (261 11th Avenue) RezoningPaul Devlin conducted the hearing on Agenda Item 32 relating to a rezoning application
for the two blocks between West 26th and West 28th Streets between 11th and 12th
Avenues. No public speakers came forward and the hearing was then closed.
Community Update: MCB4 to provide update on Empire Station Complex Project
Jeffrey LeFrancois, First Vice Chair of the Board, gave updates on the activities of the
Advisory Committee that he has been a part of since last Summer dealing with the State’s
proposal to develop the area around Penn Station under a plan known as the Empire
Station Complex Project. About four months ago, a decision was made by Community
Boards 4 and 5 and our elected officials from the district to create a bigger Working Group.
It has been meeting for the last three months on Tuesday at 4:00 in the afternoon for
about two to two and a half hours for 11 weeks. The work is now wrapping up on getting
recommendations to the State. Part of the process included gathering input from the
public at a Town Hall that was co-hosted by CB4 on July 16th wherein the State presented
its plan to the public. The Town Hall was done on Zoom and had over 200 participants and
150 questions submitted. It turned out that skyscrapers and affordable housing were the
issues that were of most concern to the public. At this point, we are awaiting a response
from the State, some of which we expect to be favorable.
Public Session
Larry Marcus Mr. Marcus announced that he had just gotten a job to promote, educate, and install solar
powered trash cans. He lives at 46th and 10th Avenue and has had experience in the solar
power industry before being offered his new job with a new product. He stated that he
wants to work with the Board in finding ways to use his trash cans in Chelsea and Hell’s
Kitchen.
Brian Weber Mr. Weber, who is a public member of the Board, is on the Midtown South Precinct
Community Council. He announced the National Night Out Against Crime event that will
take place on Tuesday, August 3rd from 5-8 pm at the McAffery Park Playground, located
at West 43rd Street between 8th and 9th Avenues. Guests can enjoy free pizza, Italian
Ices, and music. There will also be a mobile vaccination van on site.
Frank Parillo Mr. Parillo is the attorney representing the Gadfly Lounge in its liquor license application
to the SLA that is the subject of Agenda Item 2. He thanked the BLP Committee for the
hard work that went into their difficult application.
Edward Curtis Mr. Curtis has lived on 16th Street between 7th and 8th Avenues for more than 20 years.
He spoke in favor of the Gadfly Lounge application, stating that it will enhance the quality
of life in the neighborhood.
Cara and Joe Pally Ms. Pally introduced herself and her husband as the owners of the Gadfly Lounge and
thanked everyone at the meeting who came out to support them.
Chris Lebron Mr. LeBron, who is a member of the Board, spoke for himself in noting the large number
of SLA applications on the Agenda and the fact that many bars and restaurants are re-
opening. He noted the latest CDC advisories on COVOD-19 precautions and urged those
establishments to embrace the Excelsior Pass on their own before the Mayor and
Governor make statements announcing mandates.
Cathy Curtis Ms. Curtis has been a resident of West 15th Street for 35 years. She stated that she is in
favor of businesses thriving in the City so long as they do not disturb the peace of the
residents where they are located. She is concerned that the stipulations that are part ofthe Gadfly Lounge application may not be enough to mitigate the noise issues that have
prevailed at their location when it was managed by another operator.
Lauren Donovan Ms. Donovan spoke in favor of the Gadfly Lounge because she looks forward to there
being more people around at night to discourage those who come into her neighborhood
to do harm to its residents. She lives directly across from the Gadfly Lounge and has had
several bad experiences recently. She thinks the new establishment will add an element of
safety to the area.
Lisa Wager Ms. Wager is the Director of Government and Community Relations at the Fashion
Institute of Technology. She reviewed the following upcoming events:
• FIT will be opening for in-person classes in the Fall Semester, with the campus
opening on Monday, August 2nd.
• The first day of classes is Monday, August 30th and the SUNY vaccination policy
will be adhered to at the college. That means that all dormitory residents must be
vaccinated before they arrive.
• The Museum at FIT is re-opening after its closure nineteen months ago. It will re-
open on Friday, April 6th with a new exhibition titled Ravishing the Rose. The
Museum has new hours and protocols: capacity has been reduced to 50 people
with groups limited to 5 people; hand sanitizer stations are in place; and gallery
seating is available. The new hours now provide for being open on both Saturday
and Sunday from 10 am to 5 pm. Hours on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday are
from Noon to 8 pm.
Kathleen Treat Ms. Treat spoke in favor of the position taken by the Board in Agenda Item 28 regarding
the Mayor’s proposed permanent outdoor dining measure. She referred to current
problems with structures on 9th Avenue that impede the passage of ambulances and the
encroachment on sidewalks that impede pedestrians.
Marni Halasa Ms. Halasa does outreach for the homeless. She spoke about the Mayor’s ongoing efforts
to relocate about 8,000 temporary hotel shelter residents back to congregate shelters.
She stated that it has been disorienting for many residents because they aren’t sure
where they will end up when they have a special need due to a disability. She is concerned
that the vaccination rate for these temporary shelter residents is only 14%, posing a
problem for them and the community at large.
Remarks from Elected Officials and Representatives
Borough President The Borough President and all elected officials agreed not to speak at the meeting because
Gale Brewer of the long agenda. They will appear at the next General Meeting in September.

Location
Presentation / Presentation: New York State Independent Redistricting Commission
Public Hearing Ahsia Badi, the Director of Public Engagement for the New York Independent
Redistricting Commission, explained the redistricting process following the recent census
and the origin, composition, and function of the IRC. She noted that everything that she
had to say was available for review on the IRC website -- https://www.nyirc.gov/home –
and that one can sign up for updates on the site. She stated that the IRC is made up of 10
commissioners who were mandated to redraw the voting district lines for the State
legislature and Congress and submit draft plans by September 15. The IRC must also hold
12 public meetings in 10 designated cities around the state, with the Manhattan hearing
occurring on November 10. Once the public hearings have concluded and the information
gathered is synthesized, the commissioners will submit a final plan in early January.
The commissioners felt that they needed input from the public to formulate a draft plan
within a brief period and proceeded to hold 9 regional virtual meetings beginning in
August. That resulted in testimony from 300 public speakers, and 500 written submissions
containing 1,200 pages of written testimony, all of which is available on the website.
During the upcoming public hearings, the commissioners will be interested in hearing from
groups of people based on their community of interest so that they may group people
together in a district based on a common interest in a job, industry, language, faith, or
otherwise. Ms. Badi concluded her presentation with a tour of the IRC website pointing out
where data can be found and where the pages are for signing up to speak at the regional
virtual meetings.
Public Hearing: BSA Application for 157 West 24th Street
Paul Devlin, Co-Chair of the Chelsea Land Use Committee, conducted the hearing on
Agenda Item 18. No public speakers came forward and the hearing was then closed.
Public Session
Jay Li Mr. Li represents Hack Manhattan, located at 137 West 14th Street, which is a local maker
space and a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. It has been in operation for about ten yearsand was founded with the purpose of giving members of the community a space where
they can socialize, work on projects together, and learn about an arts, crafts, and
technology. The space is open whenever a member is present and is currently open for
open house events on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 7:00pm until late at night. The
organization is looking for a new location in Midtown or Downtown before its lease
expires in December.
Victoire Sherer Ms. Sherer spoke about a local public safety issue that she said has been given short shrift
by the command at the 10th Precinct involving one of its officers. She stated that on
January 12 this year in Brooklyn a police officer pulled his service weapon on a group of
citizens who asked him to put his mask on. This was pre-vaccine, during spiking COVID
cases at a time when all NYPD employees were mandated to wear a mask at all times. At
the time of the incident the officer worked at the 84th Precinct but after the video of him
pulling his gun went viral his case was taken on by the NYPD Internal Affairs Bureau. In the
Spring the officer was transferred to the 10th Precinct in Chelsea. There have been no
updates from Internal Affairs or the 10th Precinct and those who have spoken up at
Precinct meetings have been ignored. Ms. Sherer asked the Board to assist on getting an
update on the matter and to request that the officer in question be fired immediately.
Leah James Ms. James is the organizer director for Housing Conservation Coordinators and provided
updates on their services. They are open fully to the public on Tuesdays and Thursdays
from 9:30am to 5:30pm and are doing intakes for those needing legal services. At other
times people can call for help. She announced the eviction moratorium will extend to
January 15, 2022. She also stated that there are efforts in place to make free legal services
to tenants available to tenants statewide, just as they are for tenants residing in the City.
HCC will be sending flyers to those in MCD4 announcing the Westside Tenants Conference
to be held on December 4th and 5th.
Patricia Tarkington Ms. Tarkington is an affordable housing tenant at Gotham West who spoke in opposition
to the Board’s favorable position taken on the Gotham Organization’s inclusionary
housing application in Agenda Item 23. She stated that the developer is facing charges of
illegal rent hikes that violate rent stabilization laws in all the affordable housing leases
that it has in the district. She further stated that the developer is facing charges of
constructing apartments in the district and beyond which fail to meet required
accessibility standards for people with disabilities. These overcharge and faulty
construction practices are public knowledge, have been disclosed to CB4, and are likely to
be incorporated into any new project which this developer creates in the district. CB4
should not recommend approval of future projects from any developer, so long as serious
charges of non-compliance are unresolved, it is common sense. Ms. Tarkington believes
that CB4 should re-evaluate the Gotham Organization’s current practices and not rely on
the promises it made 20 years ago.
Lisa Wager Ms. Wager is the Director of Government and Community Relations at the Fashion
Institute of Technology. She gave the following updates:
• The model/activist Amber Valletta was named FIT’s first Sustainability
Ambassador for its Sustainability Awareness Week event, furthering the college's
commitment to expanding sustainability, education, so our graduates can and will
address the chain challenges facing the creative industries.
• While the East Coast Comic Con is being held at the Javits Center this week, FIT
will be holding its fourth annual Diversity Comic Con on October 15 and 16. This
year the event will be held online with many interactive elements; programs will
include panel discussions, a drawing contest, a cosplay pageant, and a networking
party in a virtual exhibition floor. The event is free and available at
http://diversitycomiccon.com/• The annual ChalkFIT live art event will take place on FIT’s Seventh Avenue wall
between 26th and 28th Streets from October 18 to October 22. During that time,
85 senior illustration students will create a mural based on a theme depicting the
new normal about what the students did to get themselves through the year and
a half of isolation. The mural will remain on the wall throughout the Fall.
Matt Y. Matt is a resident of West 48th Street who sought the Board’s help in coordinating City
agencies such as sanitation and DOH to address the issue of rat infestation on his block.
He expects the problem will worsen during the Winter months and that it will interfere
with the plans of the stores and restaurants that are hoping to reopen.
Remarks from Elected Officials and Representatives
Senator Brad Senator Hoylman commented on the fact that the current virtual meeting was made
Hoylman possible by the legislation that he carried in the extraordinary session of the Legislature in
September and that he will push for a continuation of this format because of the greater
opportunities for engagement that it provides at the community board level. He went on to
give the following updates:
• At an MTA meeting that he participated in for the Senate last week, he asked Janno
Lieber, the acting chair of the MTA, about the funding needed for both the Empire
Station Complex Plan and the Gateway Project. He was told that the final numbers
have not been determined but the projects were not dependent upon revenue
from real estate development. The Senator is collaborating with other elected
officials in the district to produce a community-advised plan before signing off on
any proposed large-scale development.
• He introduced legislation yesterday that would close a loophole in the Mayor’s
vaccination mandate by making it apply to out-of-town performers like podcaster
Joe Rogan who perform at venues such as Madison Square Garden without being
vaccinated. The mandate would apply to everyone across-the-board who attends
such performances, a sporting event, or a theatre. Celebrities and sports stars
should not be exempt from showing proof of vaccination.
• The Senator is happy to see that Broadway has reopened and was on hand for the
opening of the Manhattan Theatre Club production of Lackawanna Blues. He noted
that he fought successfully in last year’s budget negotiations to double the NYC
Musical and Theatrical Production Tax Credit.
• He urged everyone to get a flu shot in addition to the COVID-19 vaccination and
noted his flu shot event coming up on October 25 at the Fulton Center in
conjunction with other elected officials.
• Project Renewal will be holding a free mammogram screening event on October 18
on West 26th Street between 8th and 9th Avenues from 9 am to 4 pm.
• He noted that Maia Berlow has been promoted to the position of Deputy Chief of
Staff in his Manhattan office.
Borough President The Borough President noted her support for hybrid meetings under the Open Meetings
Gale Brewer Law and thanked Senator Hoylman for his efforts in the Senate. She hopes that there will
be more planning if the exemption in the law is made permanent so that community
boards will be better prepared for the change. She gave the following updates:
• She testified earlier in the day regarding open restaurants and thanked CB4 and all
the other community boards for their input on how to make open restaurants work
better in the future.• She will be meeting with Chief Steven Hughes from the Manhattan South Precinct
regarding the Business District Initiative, and she plans to discuss the 311 and 911
call data that was collected by NYC Open Data on quality-of-life issues in the
district.
• She testified on congestion pricing and, although progress is being made, she
believes that a Manhattanite with knowledge of community needs, and
transportation issues should be a member of the board that the Governor
appoints. She supports congestion pricing, but people’s voices need to be heard.
She does not want the green and yellow cabs to be charged; they are already being
charged. There are also questions about collecting tolls that must be resolved,
including the technology that will be employed.
• She has been attending meetings about climate change and electric vehicles where
the discussion has been focused on charging stations. She does not think people
know enough about what charging stations are, and she believes there should be
more discussion and education about them.
• She, like parents in the district, is concerned about schools. So, even though there
has been only one school in the Borough that has been completely closed, there
have been many classrooms that are closed. The school that was quarantined for
10 days managed to have enough tablets for its students to attend online classes.
Ms. Brewer has spent a lot of time with mental health professionals and social
workers during the pandemic to address the trauma that students have suffered
from being away from school for so long.
• During the annual Open House New York weekend that starts on Friday, the
Borough President’s office will display the original set of maps that plotted the
Manhattan street grid in 1811. Attendees will be able to register for a drawing for a
digital print of the map of their home quadrant.
• The Maggie Peyton Gallery in the Borough President’s office is showing a collection
of artworks called Welcome Back depicting life during the pandemic.
• The Recovery Task Force continues to meet every Tuesday at 3:00 pm.
• Ms. Brewer listened to questions and comments from Board members, including
information about a restaurant located at 445 West 35th Street that removed trees
and tree pits from the sidewalk in front of the establishment to build an outdoor
dining shed. She promised to investigate the matter.
Rosie Mendez for Ms. Mendez reviewed a press release that she put out earlier in the day following a hearing
the Borough at City Planning on Open Restaurants. She noted that the administration would have public
President engagement after the community boards and the Manhattan Borough Board have voted.
The administration has decided to focus on some of the testimony that dealt with
enforcement and the task force comprised of various City agencies that does not include
the NYPD. She stated that the Sheriff’s Office has been helpful with enforcement so far, but
it is unclear whether it and the NYPD would assist in enforcement in the future because
they are not part of the task force.
Assemblymember Ms. Rosenthal acknowledged the concerns that community boards have with the
Linda Rosenthal continuation of the Open Meetings Law exemption past its January 15 expiration date. She
stated that the exemption was passed in the extraordinary session because of advocacy by
the legislators from our district and that she and they would push to make it permanent in
the future. She asked that community boards send letters to their representatives shortly
before the new session begins noting how community participation has increased because
of the Zoom meeting choice.The Assemblymember provided the following updates:
• She has written letters to the DOT and MTA many times about transit signal
priority being a way to mitigate bus congestion in the City. It gives a bus driver the
ability to control traffic signals and move ahead on congested streets. She hopes
that this technology will be available in all neighborhoods soon.
• There have been concerns about the replacement of Western Beef in Chelsea by
Brooklyn Fair in the coming weeks. She said this full-service supermarket has
agreed to keep prices commensurate with Western Beef prices.
• The interns who work in her office did a survey over the Summer of all the
playgrounds in the district and Ms. Rosenthal wrote a letter to the Department of
Parks on what needed to be fixed.
• She testified at the hearing on congestion pricing where she recommended that
the program be pegged to inflation because when the law goes into effect in 2023
the value of a $60,000 per year income will not be the same as it was when the
law was enacted in 2019. She stated that people need their cars to get to work
and should be burdened with extra expenses. She wants a person from Manhattan
to be on the congestion pricing board and believes one will be appointed.
• Her annual flu shot day event will be held on October 19 from 10 am to 1 pm at
Lincoln Square Neighborhood Center. Those wishing to make the required
appointment for the shot should email her office.
• There will be COVID-19 testing event on October 20 at Lincoln Square
Neighborhood Center where the tests will be administered without cost.
• She will host her popular Shred Day event with Senator Serrano in front of her
office on Sunday, November 14 from 10 am to 2 pm.
• She will be meeting with Governor Hochul tomorrow to have bills dealing with the
opioid overdose problem signed. One of them would ensure that everyone who
has a substance use disorder and wants to participate in medication assisted
treatment while in prison and jail will have that opportunity.
Taylor Abbruzzese Ms. Abbruzzese gave updates for the Congresswoman:
for • In September, Ms. Maloney obviously had a lot going on in D.C. with reconciliation
Congresswoman and Build Back Better. She believes it is important that both bills pass and has been
Carolyn Maloney in intense negotiations with Speaker Pelosi and Progressive Caucus Chair Jayapal.
• The House Oversight Committee, which the Congresswoman chairs, marked up $12
billion to electrify USPS and federal vehicle fleets. They also marked up $60 million
for the National Archives to clear the backlog of veteran’s records requests; $40
million in funding for the Justice40 Initiative; and $50 million in funding for the
Inspector General and Government Accountability Office to ensure funds are spent
appropriately.
• In terms of the Financial Services Committee which the Congresswoman is also on,
they marked up a portion of Build Back Better focused primarily on housing. Ms.
Maloney hopes that substantial dollars to address the housing problem are
included in negotiation, so we can fix the various problems facing public housing
residents.

Location
Presentation / Presentation: Inspector Megan O’Malley, commanding officer of the Midtown North
Public Hearing Precinct, gave an overview of her command and noted that she hears residents most often
asking for more police presence on the streets. She reviewed crime statistics for the year-
end periods October 31, 2020, and 2021 noting that crime is up by 2%, or about 100 more
crimes for the period. Grand larceny is consistently the most common crime in her
precinct. When comparing statistics over a two-year period, the only increase has been in
burglaries, with an increase of about 30 cases. Crime has been up slightly during the past 4
weeks compared to 2 years ago.
Inspector O’Malley answered questions from members that had to do with preventing bike
theft; reconciling the discrepancy in actual crime statistics and the perception of crime
presented by the Citizen mobile app; the reduced allocation of personnel to the precinct;
whether the NYPD is working with school administrators in addressing the dangers young
women have been facing when travelling to and from school; the assignment of officers to
foot patrols; and, how the precinct compares to other precincts around the City in terms of
crime statistics and staffing. She indicated that there was only one shooting incident in the
precinct during the past year, making it about the lowest in the City.
Public Hearing: Manhattan Community Board 4’s Statement of District Needs and Budget
Requests for Fiscal Year 2023
First Vice Chair Jessica Chait opened the hearing and noted that the matter would be taken
up in the business session of the meeting. No speakers came forward from the public and
the hearing was closed.
Public Session
Pamela Wolff Ms. Wolff is a public member of the Board who spoke on behalf of Save Chelsea with
regard to Agenda Item 15 dealing with the nine landmarked rowhouses at Gansevoort
Market on 9th Avenue and 14th Street that are scheduled for deconstruction. She voiced
her outrage over the fact that the LPC has allowed the DOB to dictate the future of these
buildings and is therefore failing to protect them in accordance with its stated mission toprotect them. She read aloud from a letter addressed to the Mayor and LPC seeking
detailed information about the dealings each have had with the developer who is
conducting the deconstruction.
Diana DuCroz Ms. DuCroz is a member of Save Chelsea who spoke in favor of the letter that is the
subject of Agenda Item 15, stating that her organization believes the landmarked
buildings can be saved and that extraordinary measures should be taken to do so.
Lisa Wager Ms. Wager is the Director of Government and Community Relations at the Fashion
Institute of Technology. She gave the following updates:
• On Thursday, November 11, fashion journalist, author, and critic Alexander Fury
and MFIT Curator Colleen Hill will discuss Fury’s latest book, Vivienne Westwood:

from Fury’s personal collection of fashion, which includes designs by Westwood,
John Galliano, Christian Lacroix, among others.

graduate scholarships for students in FIT’s Fashion Design and Global Fashion
Management programs.
Eric Washington Mr. Washington spoke in favor of Agenda Item 14 and the landmark designation of 128
West 17th Street, formerly known as Colored School #4. He thanked the Board for the
opportunity he was given to present at the Chelsea Land Use Committee and for its
support of his efforts.
Leah James Ms. James is the director for organizing at Housing Conservation Coordinators in Hell’s
Kitchen. She reminded everyone of their 16th Annual West Side Tenant Conference that

provide.

3. Kate Linker
4. Hannah de Boer
5. Bill BorockRemarks from Elected Officials and Representatives
Borough President Ms. Brewer provided the following comments and updates:
Gale Brewer • She was surprised to learn earlier in the meeting that the Midtown Community
Court was still closed for in-person hearings and promised to look into having it
reopened soon.
• She characterized Governor Hochul’s recently announced plan for Penn Station as
“Penn Station Restoration Renovation First and Gateway 2025.” Ms. Brewer’s
concerns are about affordable housing and about the good things that can go on
above and below ground.
• She joined the many groups who are speaking about the Gansevoort Market
landmarked rowhouses in seeking a way to preserve them.
• There are 35 elected officials from New York and New Jersey who are now trying to
shut down the tourist helicopters that are flying over Manhattan and Brooklyn.
• The community board leadership training program will run until the end of the
month. Details are on the Borough President’s website.
• The Redistricting Commission is meeting on November 10 to resolve
disagreements about its plan. The biggest problems involve Inwood and
Washington Heights because of their large population loss.
• She is working to resolve the Open Meetings issue before January 15. Her office
has distributed OWL devices to community boards in anticipation of the hybrid
meeting option.
• The office holds meetings every Tuesday at 3:00 pm to discuss vaccines and their
funding sources.
• Ms. Brewer supports congestion pricing and is awaiting the Governor to appoint a
task force to set toll prices and finalize the program. She reiterated her desire to
see someone from CB4 who has transportation knowledge to be appointed to the
task force.
• Brian Lewis from her office has been working on the Penn South Commercial Site 5
Project.
• There will be a Manhattan Futures reception at John Jay College on December 12 –
details are forthcoming.
Assemblymember Mr. Gottfried gave these updates:
Dick Gottfried • He was pleased to learn at a press conference earlier in the day that Governor
Hochul has a plan to prioritize the remaking of the existing Penn Station. She was
also very emphatic about looking to include stakeholder input into the plans for
that, as has been done with the Empire Station Complex project. She did a sort of
short preview of the responses that we were expecting to get from Empire State
Development about the recommendations that the Community Advisory
Committee Working Group submitted a couple of months ago. She talked about
reducing the density of the new development, something we very much want to
have happen, and a commitment to affordable housing. She says it bothers her
that this major transportation hub for North America is named after an adjoining
state and wants us to come up with a new name.
• He and Senator Hoylman are introducing legislation to amend the Hudson River
Park Act to get the heliport out of Hudson River Park once and for all.Robert Atterbury Mr. Atterbury gave an overview of the Congressman’s activities in the House:
for Congressman • The House Judiciary Committee passed Mr. Nadler’s bill, the Nondebtor Release
Jerry Nadler Prohibition Act, which builds on the Sackler Act that prohibits companies from
using bankruptcy as a way to get around being responsible for legal judgments
such as those associated with the opioid crisis.
• The Judiciary Committee also passed the Forced Arbitration Injustice Repeal Act
which prohibits an arbitration agreement from being valid or enforceable if it
requires arbitration of an employment, consumer, antitrust, or civil rights dispute.
• A hearing was held today on judicial ethics where the bipartisan, bicameral
legislation known as the Courthouse Ethics and Transparency Act was introduced.
That Act requires federal judges to submit securities transaction reports and have
them available online, as other federal officials are required to do.
• The Congressman has been deeply involved in negotiations to keep certain
immigration provisions in the Build Back Better Act when it passes. One of those
provisions would protect about 7 million people from removal and provide them
work authorizations. These are the people who are undocumented or have lapsed
authorizations to be in the country, including 1.6 million Dreamers, 3.6 million
essential workers, and a million farm workers.
• Mr. Nadler also reintroduced the Empower Act, and the State Justice Improvement
Act which incentivizes states to find alternatives to bail and do away with excessive
court fines and fees that target low-income communities.
• The office has been pushing for the State to provide for more stakeholder
involvement in the Penn Station transportation aspect of the redevelopment, not
just the overall Empire Station Complex plan that the working group has been
involved with. That is what the Governor announced today when she spoke of the
MTA stakeholder advisory group that she is forming.
• Mr. Atterbury explained the Penn Station redevelopment plan in greater detail,
noting that it is actually comprised of 4 distinct pieces that are happening at the
same time:
o The Gateway Project – building tunnels under the Hudson River.
o Penn expansion which is about building tracks and platforms under Block
780 – the area to the south of Penn Station. This is currently in the federal
NEPA process that must be concluded before all of the proposals in the
General Project Plan can accomplished.
o The General Project Plan which deals with all of the zoning around Penn
Station and provides a general framework for the redevelopment.
o The renovation of Penn Station itself, which the Governor touched on in
her press conference today along with the General Project Plan.
Leslie Espaillat for Ms. Espaillat provided updates from the Senator’s office:
Senator Robert • He proposed the environmental rights amendment to the State Constitution that
Jackson was voted on and passed yesterday. It is a very simple amendment that says each
person shall have a right to clean air, water, and a healthful environment.
• The office has been busy dealing with the Emergency Rental Assistance Program.
We are urging anyone, especially in our District 31, if you need assistance with rent
or utilities then contact the Senator’s office. Applications for small business
recovery funds should also be made quickly because those funds will be running
out soon.
• The office completed our next-to-last food pantry and the last one will be on
November 17 in partnership with the West Side Campaign against Hunger. Each
food pantry provided 175 to 200 families with food packages.• The office has been using a COVID concern form that allows staff to flag concerns
of students, teachers, and administrators so that they may get help in the
community or in our office. Anyone who has such a concern should contact the
office.
• Quality-of-life issues remain at the top of the list for the Senator, and he has been
working with the Precincts and the community to address them.

Location
Presentation: Captain Robert Gault from the 10th Precinct (230 West 20th Street)
Presentation /
Captain Gault gave a status report and overview of conditions in the 10th Precinct over
Public Hearing
the past year and during the last 28-day period. He stated that, contrary to perceptions,
indexed crimes are down 1% for the year. As to the past 28 days, there were 908 crimes
compared to 917 during the same period last year. The main driver of that decrease was
fewer burglaries and grand larcenies. There was an uptick, however, in robberies with an
8.7% increase for the year. The same is true for felony assaults with a 17% increase – 117
ersus 100 last year. Another problematic areahas been an increase in grand larcenies of
automobiles – grand theft auto. There were 57 this year to date, compared to44 last year,
a 29.5% increase.
The precinct analyzes crimes using a precision policing model that looks for local crime
patterns. They are seeing a pattern now involving drugstore robberies where someone
enters a store with the intention of clearing products off the shelves and ends up assaulting
or threatening a worker or security guard with a weapon. The people who are committing
these crimes are often desperate individuals suffering from drug addiction. And it is the
same people who are committing these crimes over and over because they have been
released by the courts without the imposition of bail.
Public Hearing: Penn Station Area Civic and Land Use Project
The public hearing was held to give the community the opportunity to weigh in on
Agenda Item 13 – the Board’s letter to the Empire State Development Corporation
regarding the Penn Station Area General Project Plan (GPP). And because only one block in
the GPP exists in MCD4, the letter deals only with matters concerning that block. The
presentation given by ESD, however, covers the entire area and is the same as that which
will be given to the public on December 8.
Marion Phillips, the Senior Vice President of ESD, began the presentation by thanking
the Board members who participated in the Community Advisory Council – Jeffrey
LeFrancois, Lowell Kern, Christine Berthet, and Paul Devlin. He then turned the
presentation over to Holly Leicht, the Executive Vice President of Real Estate Development
at ESD.Ms. Leicht gave an overview of the GPP focusing on the revisions to the original plan
that were made over the Summer after consideration of the recommendations of the
Community Advisory Council, elected officials, Community Board 5, stakeholders, and
advocates. She stated that the revised draft GPP is based on the premise that the Penn
Station reconstruction and expansion is not optional – they are necessities. Penn Station
was built to serve 300 thousand daily commuters. By 2019 it was serving twice that many,
and by 2038 it is projected by the railroads to be serving around 890 thousand. Ms. Leicht
noted that the Penn Station area is at the heart of the central business district and that
sustainable urban growth focuses density at transportation hubs. The proposed GPP is
mindful of that idea because the Penn Station area is the largest transportation hub in the
Northern Hemisphere.
The guiding principles of the GPP can be summarized as follows:
• Develop a comprehensive redevelopment plan to generate revenue that will help
fund the reconstruction and expansion of Penn Station and other improvements.
• Support the reconstruction and expansion of Penn Station through an integrated
network of transit and public realm improvements.
• Catalyze sustainable transit-oriented, mixed-use development and enhance the
public realm around Penn Station.
• Foster New York City’s long-term economic growth through the creation of jobs,
modern office space, and new mixed-income housing.
The Penn Station Area GPP’s project area stretches from 6th to 9th Avenues and from
30th to 34th Streets and contains 8 potential redevelopment sites. Three of those sites fall
on the southern portion of the project area and their redevelopment is contingent on the
NEPA review that the railroads are about to launch. If that area is not selected as the
preferred alternative for Penn Station expansion through the NEPA process which starts
next year, then there will be no redevelopment of those 3 sites.
Governor Hochul has proposed a new way forward because she believes that New
Yorkers deserve a new Penn Station, and the community deserves a great neighborhood
around Penn Station. So, the revised GPP will therefore focus less on the expansion and
more on the reconstruction of the current Penn Station and enhancements to the
surrounding neighborhood. The revised GPP is shaped by the information that was
gathered during 18 Advisory Group meetings and 8 public meetings and town halls. Some
of the highlights of those revisions include:
• Reduced density by 1.4 million square feet.
• Up to 1,800 residential units, 540 of which would be permanently affordable.
• About 8 acres of public space and the creation of a Public Realm Task Force and a
Public Realm Fund.
• Increased public transit access.
• More space for community and innovative social services.
• More than 50,000 good-paying construction jobs.
• Greener, transit-oriented commercial growth with a requirement that all new
buildings be electric.
Ms. Leicht offered the following timeline:
• December 8 – Public Hearing on Draft GPP, DEIS, and proposed revisions followed
by a 30-day public comment period.
• January 10 – End of public comment period.
• Q1/Q2 2022 – ESD makes a final decision on the EIS and GPP. The Public Realm
Task Force is launched if it is approved.Public Hearing Speakers
Eugene Mr. Sinigalliano, who is a member of the Community Advisory Council, limited his
Sinigalliano comments to the area within MCD4: Block 1 which represents about 5% of the total project
area. He said, the way the plan is set up now and unless things change according to the
suggestions in the Board’s proposed letter, the only promise that displaced residents have
for residential housing is 10 years down the road on Block 1. Only if the Board’s proposed
changes to have housing built on other earlier-completed sites is accepted, will displaced
residents have a place to return to before 10 years. Otherwise, he stated, they must rely on
the housing slated for Block 1 – something that CB4 should take responsibility for. In that
regard, he believes that the statement in the letter about residents being able to return to
housing at the same affordability levels is not accurate based on conversations he has had
with ESD. He wants CB4 to push for that in its letter and to include specific mention of
displaced rent-stabilized residents and seniors.
Pamela Wolff Ms. Wolff, who is a public member of CB4, read a statement on behalf of the Empire State
Coalition, whichis composed of 13 community and civic organizations: “The Coalition
opposes the Empire Station Plan for the Penn area, including the minor variationsrecently
proposed by Governor Hochul. The plan is unnecessarily destructive of our city's historic
fabric and eliminates a functioning valuable swath of the city. It unnecessarily demolishes
peoples' homes. unnecessarily destroys thousands of small business jobs, and foolishly
builds 10 new Class A office towers -- an extension of the widely detested Hudson Yards.
This bloated development plan is one that benefits only Vornado, the city'slargest real
estate investment trust.This push for a developer's fiefdom, the so called Vernado
Campus, destroys a church, a beloved sky bridge, multiple landmarked hotels, and a rare
remnant of the original Penn Station.It is a plan filled with displacement and destruction.
Moreover, the proposed improvements toPenn Station are minor and do not need to be
funded by Vornado skyscrapers. They are lipstick-on-a pig improvements and could easily
be funded through other means. Ten newtowers cannot be justified with any reasonable
argument. Tossing in a bit of affordable housing does not improve the plan, nor does
pedestrianization of a street soon to be in dark shadows.The tragedy is this: better ideas
exist and are being ignored.Madison square garden could easily be moved by repurposing
the billions in funding slated for an unnecessary borough jail.And converting Penn Station
to allow through running is a solid proposal that would avoid most of the wanton
destruction and is an idea whose time is now, not in the future.Last, an above ground
station is also an idea that is easily achieved and would better serve the broad public than
the attempts tomake it palatable through superficial tweaks.”
Public Session Speakers
Bjorn Thorstad Mr. Thorstad is a resident of West 17th Street across from the nightclub 1Oak. He
complained about the noise produced by their sound system and requested that the
Board not approve any liquor license applications by 1Oak unless adequate soundproofing
is installed.
Ivana Cepeda Ms. Cepeda moved to Hell’s Kitchen from the Bronx in February, and she works in
Chelsea. She commented on the rising number of thefts at business establishments in
Hell’s Kitchen and noted that the Target store had to change its hours because of it. Shealso mentioned that aggressive panhandling is more prevalent now and that she has been
personally affected by it.
Caroline Wood Ms. Wood spoke in praise of the Open Streets program and how much it has increased
the quality of life on her block of West 22nd Street with less car traffic and cleaner streets.
She feels the neighborhood has also become safer and friendlier. She thanked her
neighbor Melodie Bryant for her work in facilitating it.
Miriam Fisher Ms. Fisher lamented the fact that she was not able to be heard during Captain Gault’s
presentation because she wished to speak about a robbery that occurred in her building.
Then, as she was speaking, Captain Gault emailed a response. Ms. Fisher went on to ask
the Board to be sure to follow up on its letter to the Governor about congestion pricing as
it relates to people with disabilities needing an exemption from having to pay tolls.
Lisa Wager Ms. Wager is the Director of Government and Community Relations at the Fashion
Institute of Technology. She provided her customary monthly updates:
• For the 20th year, an FIT faculty member, Barbara Berman, was the Macy's
Thanksgiving Day Parade costume chief. She led the Parade’s costume crew in
assembling and dressing 600 clowns, 300 float escorts, 160 teens, 75 stilt walkers,
2000 balloon handlers, 450 officials, 100 banner carriers, and other lucky
participants.
• Virginia Bonofiglio, an assistant professor and associate chair of the Cosmetics and
Fragrance Marketing Department, was inducted into the Fragrance Foundation
circle of champions. The Foundation is a nonprofit devoted to expertise,
innovation and education in the fragrance industry and her induction into the
circle marks the first time that an educator with given this honor. And, along with
the induction the Foundation announced a fragrance foundation FIT diversity
scholarship, a $100,000 academic award that will benefit undergraduate and
graduate students of diverse backgrounds in the cosmetics and fragrance
marketing program who are interested in pursuing a career in fragrance.
• Ms. Wager noted what she called the “astonishing work” of the FIT associate
degree students in the Fashion Design program that is now on display in the lobby
of the Pomerantz Building located on the North corner of 27th Street and 7th
Avenue.
Melodie Bryant Ms. Bryant spoke in favor of the Open Street improvements on West 22nd Street outlined
in the Transportation Committee draft letter. She and her neighbors have been operating
West 22nd is an Open Street since May of 2020 and it has been extremely popular with
residents and the neighborhood at large. In a survey taken last year, 91% of respondents
approved of Open Streets, and a full 73% wanted more greenery.
Remarks from Elected Officials and Representatives
Senator Brad Senator Hoylman spoke while riding a train to Albany. He presented Chair Lowell Kern with
Hoylman a Proclamation signed by his colleagues in government commemorating his successful term
as Chair. The Proclamation recites, among other things, the Chair’s progression up the
ranks of CB4, his success in transitioning to remote Board meetings, and for retaining the
Board’s stability during the pandemic. The Proclamation also recites other Board
accomplishments during his term, such as improvements to parks, the creation of
affordable housing, and the Board’s participation in the discussions about the Port
Authority Bus Terminal, Penn Station, and the rehabilitation of the Elliott-Chelsea andFulton Houses. It notes his creation of the Social and Racial Justice Task Force and his being
appointed to the Board of Directors of the Hudson River Park Trust. The Proclamation
declares Wednesday, December 1st to be Lowell Kern Appreciation Day in New York State’s
27th Senate District, New York State’s 67th and 75th Assembly Districts, the Borough of
Manhattan, and New York City’s Third Council District.
Assemblymember Ms. Rosenthal thanked Chair Kern for his extraordinary service and steering the ship during
Linda Rosenthal one of the most tumultuous times in our history. She went on to give the following
updates:
• She did a walkthrough around West 42nd and 11th Avenue with Christine Berthet
of the CB4 Transportation Committee and the DOT Borough Commissioner and
other staff to discuss bus traffic concerns in that area. It’s well known that the
intersection is a mess and on that day cars and trucks were in the bike lane,
vehicles were blocking the box and cutting off pedestrians and forcing them to
walk in between cars. Ms. Rosenthal and Ms. Berthet came up with some solutions
that were memorialized in a letter to DOT.
• In older transportation news, the West 57th and Eighth intersection was finally
redesigned. Ms. Rosenthal had been working with CB4 on this for years and years
to change the flow of traffic in that area. The intersection was one of the most
dangerous and DOT finally implemented the changes right before the pandemic.
• A building in the district had an open facade violation for close to five years. The
tenants were reporting that the landlord failed to make repairs. Ms. Rosenthal
wrote to DOB requesting an inspection and a plan of action to compel the landlord
to resolve this complaint. As a result, the DOB made the inspection, and an
emergency work order was placed on the building. And because the building is at
risk of collapsing due to the landlord’s neglect, the tenants were issued a vacate
order and will be forced to move out over the course of the year. Ms. Rosenthal is
awaiting an audit report from the DOB on scaffolding throughout the City.
• DOT finally removed the Donald Trump sign from the West Side Highway at 79th
Street after a monthslong request to the Commissioner to do so.
• In response to constituents’ concerns, Ms. Rosenthal wrote to the new Chair of the
USPS asking that Postmaster General DeJoy be replaced.
• The bill that Ms. Rosenthal and Senator Hoylman sponsored banning the sale and
possession of ghost guns was signed into law this month.
• After 13 years of Ms. Rosenthal carrying the bill, the Employer Privacy Law was
signed into law. That means that employers must inform new employees upon
hiring that all internet-related devices are their property, not the employees and
that they can monitor an employee’s activity at will. The issue became resonant
during the pandemic when everyone was sitting at home on Zoom and being
monitored by an employer. The bill levels the playing field in a way to protect both
employees and employers.
• After Ms. Rosenthal heard from a constituent that they were unable to get copies
of utility bills to show proof of legal tenancy, Ms. Rosenthal got a bill passed that
requires telephone companies, cable providers, and utilities to furnish copies of
bills free to poor people.
Councilmember Ms. Rosenthal congratulated Chair Kern for “his wonderful tenure.” She then announced
Helen Rosenthal that the meeting would be her last as a City Council representative for part of the district.
She thanked everyone for giving her the opportunity to serve them and called out somemembers for educating her about the issues that are most important to the district,
specifically, land use and NYCHA.
Ms. Rosenthal said she appreciated everyone who shared their thoughts on two positions
that she took that became somewhat controversial: the desegregation plan in the rezoning
of the district north of MCD4 that resulted in the desegregation of 3 schools, and support
for the homeless who were staying at the Lucerne Hotel during the pandemic. She
proceeded to mention that, in 2019, she was identified as the No.1 Legislator by City &
State Magazine for having passed lots of bills and helping lots of people. More information
about Ms. Rosenthal can be found at https://helenrosenthal.com/
Jordan Feiner for Mr. Feiner introduced himself as the new CB4 liaison in the Office of Speaker Johnson – a
Speaker Corey position that he will maintain in the Office of Erik Bottcher. He mentioned that he has been
Johnson working on special events and projects in the Speaker’s Office since 2018. He noted two
upcoming events:
• The 4th Annual Holiday Season Toy Drive will begin tomorrow, December 2. Drop-
offs of unwrapped toys can be made at the district office, located at 224 West 30th
Street, from 12:00 – 5:00pm. Drop-offs can also be made on December 7 during
the same hours.
• A holiday season meal distribution will be conducted with the Migrant Kitchen of
Hudson Guild on December 23 at both the Fulton Community Center and the
Hudson Guild Elliott Center.
Borough President MS. Brewer made her final virtual appearance as Borough President while riding in a car.
Gale Brewer She commented on the tough times that community boards had to face in recent times
and that Chair Kern and the Board displayed strength to overcome those difficulties. As an
example, she cited her conversation earlier in the day with the Chair of NYCHA who
indicated to her his intention to employ the same resident engagement process that was
used by CB4 in Chelsea at the Manhattanville development in district 9. She thanked
everyone on the Board who was part of that process. She also thanked the members who
have been involved in the Penn Station reconstruction, noting that Governor Hochul has
indicated her willingness to work more closely with the community than the previous
Governor.
Ms. Brewer spoke about the “awesome feeling” she had while touring Pier 57 earlier in the
day, noting the work of CB4 on the open space project that makes all of its assets easily
accessible to the public. She provided some additional updates:
• She continues to work on the issues concerning the homeless and stated that Brian
Lewis of her office has been trying to bring the Business District Recovery Initiative
into the conversation along with the Midtown South Homeless Forum.
• She continues her efforts in getting the Midtown Court fully reopened and having it
funded adequately.
• She voiced her concern about the increase in the number of fulfillment centers in
the Borough. These centers are essentially warehouses that enable rapid delivery
services to deliver food items in 15 or 30 minutes. She believes the very concept is
dangerous because of the danger that delivery workers pose for pedestrians. There
is also a question about whether a warehouse is legal in a commercial district, the
place where these fulfillment centers tend to operate.
• Every Tuesday at 3:00pm, there is a meeting in her office to discuss vaccines and
funding. The Deputy Comptroller of the City of New York gave a presentation at thelast meeting where he presented Scott Stringer’s latest assessment of current and
future funding.
• The Borough President’s year-end reception will be held on Sunday, December 2,
at John Jay College from 2 – 4pm.

• The Chair thanked Co-Secretary Mike Noble for his many years of service,
noting that this would be his last meeting in that position. He asked Mr.
Noble for an update on the Chelsea NYCHA Working Group of which he is
a member. Mr. Noble stated that a Resident Review Committee was
formed after the release of the Working Group Report in February to help
draft a request for proposals (RFP), review developer proposals, and
interview candidates. Yesterday, it was announced at the tenant
association meetings of Fulton and Elliott-Chelsea Houses that a

PRESENTATIONS /
There were no presentations or hearings this month.
PUBLIC HEARINGS
Public Session
Brett Firfer Mr. Firfer is a member of the Board who spoke on his own behalf regarding the recent
nation-wide spate of anti-Semitic hate crime assaults and the recent increase in the number
of incidents that have taken place in and around the City. He called upon our elected
officials to provide law enforcement protection for all religious congregations. He noted
that security has become the foremost expense for religious congregations – too much for a
religious nonprofit to handle on its own. He believes that the NYPD must be physically
present when congregations are at most risk: during services and other gatherings. The
emergency funding offered by the City and the federal government is not enough. It takes
more than off-duty police officers to provide adequate protection. Religious congregations
have a right to expect the presence of on-duty officers without having to pay for their
services.
Miriam Fisher Ms. Fisher represents the Elevator Action Group which advocates for making subways
100% accessible for people with disabilities and others who need access to the subway
system. She asked for our support in seeking MTA funding. And, just as she did at last
month’s Board meeting, Ms. Fisher provided pre-addressed and stamped postcards
addressed to the Governor.
Lisa Wager Ms. Wager is the Director of the Office of Government Relations at the Fashion Institute of
Technology. She made the following announcements:
• Fashion Design graduate Yasemin Esmek knitted the six sweaters that Tom Hanks
wore in the Mister Rogers movie Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood. She recreated
the signature zip-up cardigans that he wore in every TV episode, some of which are
in the Smithsonian Museum. Her daughter is studying shoe design at FIT.
• Registration for FIT’s pre-college programs for middle and high school students
began on December 10 and will remain open until February 22 for the
Saturday/Sunday Live programs and until April 4 for the workshop programs
offered over the NYC public schools spring break. The pre-college courses are
experiential learning opportunities that also help students explore possible majorsand careers and to prepare a portfolio to apply to an arts-focused high school or
college.
Remarks from Elected Officials and Representatives
Senator Brad The Senator provided his monthly update:
Hoylman • MulchFest, the Parks Department program that designates locations across the City
for Christmas tree chipping, is underway and will run until January 11. Locations
can be found on the Parks website:
https://www.nycgovparks.org/highlights/festivals/mulchfest
• The new legislative session begins on January 9 when the Governor presents his
State of the State and Budget address. At the end of 2019, the Governor signed
many of the Senator’s bills into law, including a bill to enhance free access to HIV-
post exposure care for sexual assault victims, and a bill banning PFAS, a toxic
chemical contained in firefighting foam.
• Some legislation coming up in the new session includes a bill that the Senator
sponsored with Assemblywoman Rosenthal that bans e-cigarettes. The law would
go beyond the FDA ban and include all flavors of e-cigarettes and other flavored
tobacco products, including menthol cigarettes.
• The Governor has indicated that he will support the Senator’s bill to ban “ghost
guns” which are made from components that make them untraceable by law
enforcement.
• The Senator will be working on a law that has been called the Walking While Trans
Statute, which protects transgender women of color who are disproportionately
affected by a law prohibiting “loitering for the purpose of engaging in a prostitution
offense.”
• The Senator is carrying legislation to require insurers to cover PrEP medication
which is taken within 72 hours of exposure to the HIV virus. The law would also
prohibit insurers requiring pre-authorization for PrEP.
• The Senator attended a meeting and is fighting with other elected officials in the
district against the owner of the Riverview Senior Independent Living facility who
has announced the sale of the facility and the eviction of all of its senior residents.
• He is reintroducing legislation that would stop landlords from warehousing
affordable apartments that they intend to convert into luxury market-rate apartments
should recently passed rent laws be rolled back.
• The Vehicular Violence Accountability Act that the Senator sponsored was
introduced in the legislature. The law would enable more prosecutions of dangerous
drivers by creating a new article of the Penal Law.
Assemblymember Mr. Gottfried noted the Governor’s recent veto of legislation relating to Pier 40. The
Dick Gottfried legislation would have amended the Hudson River Park Act to allow, among other things,
office space with structures no taller than 88 feet. The understanding has always been that
there would be designated sites along the park that would generate income to support the
park. As it turns out, almost all of those sites are in Community District 4 and, with the
exception of Pier 76, have been developed. The only commercial site in District 2 is Pier 40.
It is Mr. Gottfried’s contention that Pier 40 has never fulfilled its obligation to support the
whole park. The legislation in question would have limited Pier 40’s ability to produce
adequate revenue and that is why he vetoed the legislation when it was in the Assembly.
Furthermore, the law is so restrictive that no developer would want to respond to the RFP
issued by the Hudson River Park Trust.Another important issue arose on New Year’s Eve when the Governor announced across-
the-board cuts to Medicaid funding levels. Less funding means that the quality of care for all
patients, rich and poor, will suffer. Mr. Gottfried stated that he will fight to have funding
restored in the budget along with other items as well.
Assemblymember The Assemblymember gave the following updates:
Linda Rosenthal • On New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day she continued working with the
Governor’s staff on four bills that had to be addressed. The Governor ended up
signing two of the four and two were vetoed. He vetoed the Securing Wages Earned
Against Theft Act but made a commitment to make it a priority in the upcoming
session. Even when a judge rules that an employee is owed money for stolen wages,
many employees cannot collect. The law would give an employee a fighting chance
by creating a lien on the offending employer’s company.
• Another bill that the Governor vetoed has to do with people on Medicaid who have
a substance abuse disorder having to obtain prior authorization from an insurer
before receiving medication. The Governor, however, did sign a bill that allows
commercial insurance holders to get medication without prior authorization.
• The Governor also signed Ms. Rosenthal’s bill to protect call center jobs. Now, any
call center company that has taken loans, grants or tax breaks from New York State
will forfeit those benefits if they move 30% of their jobs out of state.
• Ms. Rosenthal gave additional information about the Riverview senior facility in
Hell’s Kitchen that Senator Hoylman discussed earlier in the meeting. She said that
she is working with the Attorney General’s office to determine whether the owner
of the building, which is a charity, has any outstanding obligations to the state that
would prohibit it from selling the building. She also stated that she is exploring
options that would allow residents to remain in place, such as having another
nonprofit buy the building.
Jessica Mates for Ms. Mates presented recent updates:
Borough • Community board reapplications must be submitted by January 21 – CB4 is
President Gale currently lagging behind.
Brewer • The BP will be receiving money from the state to fund grants for groups working on
the 2020 Census. An announcement will be made when the funds are available.
• Capital funding grant applications will be available at the end of January.
• The Religious Facilities Task Force has been working with congregations to help
them find ways to survive without giving in to developers. The next public hearing
will be held at Harlem Hospital on January 14 at 6:00 pm. It will also be live-
streamed.
• The commissioner of the NYS Homes and Community Renewal agency will host a
forum with the BP to discuss recent changes to the rent laws on January 10 from
3:00 – 5:00 pm at the Borough Office at 1 Centre Street.
• A Trash Talk will be held on January 16 from 6:30 – 8:30 pm at 318 West 118th
Street where presenters will explain innovative sustainability projects in Manhattan
and across the City.
Carl Wilson for Mr. Wilson gave his monthly update:
Speaker Corey • The office held its 2nd Annual Holiday Toy Drive with Holy Apostles Soup
Johnson Kitchen, collecting over 1000 toys compared to 400 the year before.
• There will be a SCRIE/DRIE workshop on January 22 from 12:00 – 2:00 pm at
Visions at Selis Manor, located at 135 West 23rd Street. It will be held with the
Mayor’s public engagement program.
• There will be a Department of Buildings Office Hours Day in the district office at
224 West 30th Street on January 8 from 11:00 am – 2:00 pm. Members of the
Office of the Tenant Advocate and the DOB will be on hand to discuss buildingissues during 15-minute meetings that can be arranged by email or a call to the
office.
• The City Council passed a bill in December requiring new residential buildings with
more than 40 units that receive financial assistance from the city to set aside at least
15% of their units for the homeless. The measure is expected to generate at least
1,000 units each year and would take effect in July of 2020.
Luke Wolf for Mr. Wolf offered updates from the Comptroller’s Office:
Comptroller • The Comptroller released his annual State of the City’s Economy and Finances
Scott Stringer report. The national and local economies have continued to grow, with the City
economy growing faster than the U.S. economy at 2.9% -- up from 2.8% in 2018.
There were also 2% more jobs than the prior year; unemployment is at an all-time
low of 4.2%, and hourly wages increased by 4.1%.
• Last month the Comptroller returned over $400,000 in unpaid wages to workers
across the City in his battle against wage theft that he is conducting with Attorney
General Tish James.
• The Comptroller audited the MTA in its purchases of new train cars. In its most
recent order for 300 subway cars, only 18 were delivered on time. This led to over
$35 million in repairs to old cars that would not have had to be done otherwise.
• In his role as one of the biggest pension officers in the country, the Comptroller has
been pushing for greater corporate responsibility. He has called on Facebook,
Comcast, McDonald’s, and other large corporations to ensure that they are
representing the values of New York City and all of the people within it.

Little Island is the new 2.4-acre park being constructed at Pier 55 along the
Hudson River atop 132 tulip-shaped concrete pillars. The project is part of the
Hudson River Park Trust and is a nonprofit funded by the Diller/von Furstenberg
Family Foundation. Little Island will offer arts, education, and community programs
throughout the year once completed. The park will be substantially completed by
the end of the year and will be open to the public in the Spring of 2021.

Public Session
Miriam Fisher Ms. Fisher represents the Elevator Action Group which advocates for making subways
100% accessible for people with disabilities and others who need access to the subway
system. She asked for our support in seeking MTA funding from the Governor and asking
that a person with a disability be appointed to the MTA board. Ms. Fisher provided pre-
addressed and stamped postcards addressed to the Governor that can be filled out with
requests and relevant zip codes.
Carla Fine Ms. Fine is the author of No Time to Say Goodbye: Surviving the Suicide of a Loved One.
She noted the recent suicide of a teenager at the 150-foot-high Vessel at Hudson Yards and
worries that it will become a choice for others because of its historic significance. There are
no safety measures employed on the structure that would reduce the risk such as clear
plastic barriers. Ms. Fine is seeking the help of CB4 to have Related Co. erect barriers at
the Vessel.
Tyrone Anthony Mr. Anthony has lived at 300 West 46th Street for five years and is the building’s tenant
president. He thanked District Manager Jesse Bodine for responding to complaints

tenants are being harassed by the landlord by depriving them of their community room. He
also complained of frequent elevator problems in the building.Lisa Wager Ms. Wager is the Director of the Office of Government Relations at the Fashion Institute of

$76,400, putting them in the top 2% nationwide. Among graduates with bachelor’s
degrees, FIT was ranked 14th nationwide in salary potential for art-related majors

with custom cleats. Mr. Powell chose charities that fight colon and pancreatic
cancer.

March 2020 Full Board Meeting Minutes
Presentation: Joli R. Golden, Launch of the 2020 U.S. Census
Ms. Golden gave a status update for the launch of the Census:
PRESENTATIONS /
• Counting will begin this month with the group quarters enumeration in
PUBLIC HEARINGS
dormitories, long-term care facilities, prisons, and the homeless population.
• There will also be a great deal of hiring in March to handle the non-
response enumeration in April.
• The Census will be sending out invitations to respond in March; one can
respond online, by mail or by phone. Unlike the 2010 Census, this year the
Census will contain only a short-form questionnaire containing 10
questions. The only way to be counted is to fill out a questionnaire. Failure
to do so will decrease the amount of federal funding allocated to New York
for the next ten years.
Presentation: Community Update from Friends of the High Line
Mauricio Garcia, the Chief Programming Engagement Officer at the High Line,
reviewed programming slated for the High Line in 2020:
• The 30th Street Spur is where the largest pieces of artwork are displayed on
the High Line. One that has been in place since June 2019 is Brick House,
the 16-foot-tall bronze bust of a Black woman. It will remain until
September 2020 and be replaced with a new piece in October.
• “In/With Chelsea” which began last October, will run through September
2020. It is a series of artworks using signs to insert local memory and
advocacy within the streetscapes of North Chelsea surrounding the Spur.
• The large mural The Baayfalls located adjacent to the Highline at 22nd
Street will remain on display until December 2020.
• In an effort to spark civic dialogue among its guests and neighbors, the High
Line has launched a campaign using signs that ask the question “What
would you imagine is possible here.” Responses are used to inform
programming and community engagement efforts.
• The summer dance program Arriba! runs from May through August,
providing music by local salsa legends for participants to learn and practice
their dance skills.
• This year the High Line will host its fifth annual Out of Line series which
gives various unclassifiable performance artists a unique venue for their
experimental work. Past performances can be viewed here:
https://www.thehighline.org/public-programs/out-of-line/
• The High Line has been running a local teen program for several years
where they recruit and hire local teens to work on the High Line supporting
various programs focused on arts and culture, horticulture, sustainability,
and civic engagement. This year there are 20 teens in the program who arealso helping with the High Line’s efforts relating to the City Council
Participatory Budgeting program.
Public Session
Scott Sobol Mr. Sobol resides on West 52nd Street. He stated that he is grateful for the City’s
commitment to providing supportive housing for the LGBTQ community at Hartley House
and 500 West 52nd Street. Compared to the number of luxury units built recently in Hell’s
Kitchen, there has been very little moderate- and middle-income housing built. That’s why
he wants CB4 to fulfill the promise it made in 2018 to encourage such housing by
supporting development on the MTA site at 54th Street and 9th Avenue.
Zach Schmahl Mr. Schmahl is the owner of Schmackery’s Cookies, located at 45th and 9th Avenue and
operating successfully since opening 8 years ago. He is dismayed by the fact that most of
his 40 employees are unable to afford to live in Hell’s Kitchen and have to commute often
at late hours. He too wants CB4 to push for the development of the MTA site on 9th
Avenue.
Ruby Rims Mr. Rims, a performer in the City for 45 years and a resident of Hell’s Kitchen for 25
years, is a 28-year AIDS survivor. He asked the Board to support the development of the
MTA site for people like himself.
Kathleen Treat Ms. Treat is a resident of Manhattan Plaza who thanked the BLP Committee for its letter to
the State Liquor Authority regarding Spot Bar, which is the subject of Agenda Item 1. She
asked the Board to approve the letter out of respect for the residents of her neighborhood.
Sabrina Reveron Ms. Reveron is a member of the Board who spoke on her behalf regarding two physical
assaults that she suffered recently in Hell’s Kitchen – one on the subway and the other in a
local pharmacy. Although not seriously hurt, Ms. Reveron is disturbed mostly by the fact
that each of her assailants was homeless and suffering from drug abuse and mental illness.
She wants the residents of her neighborhood to be aware of this public health crisis and
their safety.
Rebecca Kasper Ms. Kasper lives with her husband and young child on West 45th Street in an apartment
that became available through the affordable housing lottery. Her five-year-old son attends
school a few blocks away and can walk to school, something that his teachers are unable to
do because of affordability issues. She is advocating for affordable housing in Hell’s
Kitchen to accommodate them and others.
Jeffrey Moses Mr. Moses lives with his husband on West 49th Street and wishes to grow his family and
remain in the neighborhood. This may be possible if the MTA site is reserved for
affordable housing.
Ted Aremas Mr. Aremas is the owner of Rise Bar and hopes to become the owner of Spot Bar. He
stated that he has petitions with over 400 signatures in favor of the bar, along with 36 out
40 residents who live above the bar being in favor of it. He believes that having an
operation like his with its security team would enhance the safety of the neighborhood.
Bobby Robaina Mr. Robaina works in the Office of Government Relations at the Fashion Institute of
Technology. He made the following announcements:FIT Graphic Design alumnus Rob Norman has a strong partnership with the Brooklyn
Nets. He designs the uniforms for the Nets dancers, and he’s collaborated with the
basketball team.
Last month, Mr. Norman was celebrated by the Nets during Black History Month as a
designer and retailer who has promoted the Brooklyn community through the company
he founded, Planet Brooklyn Academy. They made a film about him and showed it on
the big jumbotron. He also got an official Brooklyn Nets jersey. There is a video of the
event on the Planet Brooklyn Academy’s Facebook page.
A new exhibition that opened at The Museum at FIT in February and it’s on display until
April 18:
Ballerina: Fashion’s Modern Muse explores the influence of classical ballet and
ballerinas on high fashion from the early 1930s to the late ‘70s, with more than 90 objects
on view including a dazzling array of tutu-inspired couture gowns with boned bodices and
voluminous skirts; American ready-to-wear separates based on leotards and tights and leg
warmers; and footwear ranging from “ballerina” flat slippers to “pointe”-style high heels.
FIT does a private, curator-led tour for our neighbors for each exhibition on a Monday
evening when the museum is closed to the public. The tour for Ballerina will be on
Monday, April 13th, from 6 to 7 pm. Those wishing to attend can email Mondays-
Friends@fitnyc.edu.
Sterling Cox Mr. Cox currently handles security at the Rise Bar and will move over to the Spot Bar if it
is approved by the SLA. He promised the same level of security that has made the Rise Bar
a welcome part of the community.
Eric Sawyer Mr. Sawyer is the founder of Act Up New York, the coalition that is fighting the AIDS
crisis. He criticized those in the community who have put up signs defaming people with
AIDS and objecting to the proposed Housing Works shelter for AIDS victims.
Tracy Choi Mr. Choi believes Spot Bar’s application should be denied because its owners at Rise Bar
have violated their stipulations to the SLA regarding its method of operation and has also
violated their certificate of occupancy by continually having too many occupants.
Denise Williams Ms. Williams is a resident of 554 West 53rd Street who objects to the policies of Clinton
Housing Corporation concerning the availability of resources to deal with tenants who have
been traumatized and require social services.
Declan Quinlan Mr. Quinlan spoke in favor of Spot Bar because it provides a needed gathering place for the
gay community of Hell’s Kitchen.
Marni Halasa Ms. Halasa is with the group Fight for NYCHA that has organized tenants from the Fulton
and Elliott Chelsea Houses who are displeased with the Mayor’s Working Group that is
dealing with the possible RAD conversion at Fulton. They claim that they are being shut
out of meetings of the Working Group in violation of the Open Meetings law and that their
objections to RAD are not being heard.
Vera Rasida Ms. Rasida is a resident of Elliott Chelsea Houses who voiced her support of Fight for
NYCHA.
Ms. Curley Ms. Curley has been a resident of Elliott Chelsea for 18 years and her family has lived there
since 1953. She recently got a notice from NYCHA stating that an apartment safety
inspection was scheduled for a lead assessment. The notice indicates that NYCHA will
make entry into the apartment if no one is home and that tenants must pick up their newkeys at an office on the Lower East Side to return to their apartment. Ms. Curley states that
this is all in violation of her lease which allow for entry only in the case of an emergency.
Mike Riegelman Mr. Riegelman is a longtime New Yorker who complained about the conditions
surrounding 44th Street and 9th Avenue that have severely declined over the years. He
noted that the combination of vacant buildings, scaffolding, and several problematic
residential buildings have been the cause of this, and that the NYPD has to increase patrols
in the area to make it safe again.
Joe Klienplatz Mr. Klienplatz is an AIDS survivor who asked the Board to show compassion when
considering issues related to housing for people in his circumstances.
Aleta LaFargue Ms. LaFargue is the president of the Manhattan Plaza Tenants Association who arrived
with petitions addressed to all of the district’s elected officials arguing against the
application of Spot Bar. She doesn’t another bar 10th Avenue because she believes there
are too many already. She would rather see another establishment that will serve a different
demographic than that served by Spot Bar.
Rene Santos Mr. Santos lives in a building in Hell’s Kitchen with over 200 tenants. He is in support of
more affordable housing in the area and he has attended meetings in his building during
which the topic was discussed concerning the MTA site. He noted that his wife teaches in
the area and that only 4 out of 50 teachers at her school live in Manhattan. He wants more
affordable housing, not only for teachers but for police officers and nurses as well.
Allan Azarki Mr. Azarki is a resident of Hell’s Kitchen who works as a zoning and building code
specialist. He stated that the Rise Bar is in compliance with code requirements but that
there are still issues remaining as to whether the Spot Bar space has been legally converted.
Brett Rieben Mr. Rieben spoke in support of the Spot Bar application stating that it would provide
another needed safe space for the gay community just as the Rise Bar does.
Eduardo E. Eduardo spoke in favor of making the MTA site available for affordable housing.
Donald Bernstein Mr. Bernstein is the attorney for Spot Bar. He stressed the importance of a statement made
earlier by the owner that a majority of the people who live near the bar support it. He noted
440 petition signatures, 250 letters, and the support of 2 elected officials. He also made the
point that the BLP Committee voted against the application mainly because the premises
did not have a liquor license previously. He argued that no law or regulation mandates such
a requirement. He also believes that 13 liquor licenses within 500 feet does not mean the
area is necessarily “saturated.”
Douglas Leland Mr. Leland is a 24-year resident of Manhattan Plaza who served for many years as the
president of the tenant’s association, during which time he visited many of the bars
proposed by John Blair, one of the owners of Rise Bar. He stated that they all had “horror
stories” associated with them. He also believes that the neighborhood already has 3 gay
bars within a 4-block area and therefore doesn’t need another.
Steve Belida Mr. Belida is the head of 49-54th Street Alliance. He stated that most of his meetings
concern the affordable housing that the City has promised since 2005. He proposed a site at
39th Street and 11th Avenue that would offer twice the amount of affordable housing than
would be available at the MTA site on 9th Avenue and wonders why no one has considered
that. His members focus on all demographics when discussing affordable housing and that
includes teachers, nurses and others who provide services to the neighborhood, not just the
gay community.Angel Soto Mr. Soto is a community organizer with GMHC. He asserted that the housing that purports
to be affordable is not when one considers that most people don’t make the $80,000 or
$90,000 required to qualify.
Mr. Omak Mr. Omak has lived in the City since 1979 within the LGBT community. He has been the
head of several organizations and lived in housing reserved for those with AIDS. He
believes that affordable housing for those with AIDS should be provided to all people with
the disease, not only one part of the community.
Timothy Guest Mr. Guest lives above the Rise Bar on the first floor and stated that there have been no
sound issues for him.
David Beatty Mr. Beatty has lived in the City since the mid-eighties and supports the Spot Bar
application. He supports Spot Bar because he believes it will increase security in the
neighborhood and the owners have done a good job at their other establishments.
Dr. Patrick Dr. Murray has lived in Hell’s Kitchen for 8 years and supports Spot Bar because it will be
Murray run by responsible owners and operators. From his experience as a sound engineer, he does
not think sound propagation from the bar will be a problem.
DJ Johnson Mr. Johnson is a marketing consultant at American Express and has worked with several
gay rights organizations that have been given free venue space by the owners of Rise Bar.
He is a supporter of Spot Bar.
Daniel Gorman Mr. Gorman is running for office in the State Assembly to represent District 75 which
covers Hell’s Kitchen. He is a veteran, a Progressive, and a social worker. He wants
everyone to get out and vote on June 23rd.
Adrienne Ford Ms. Ford is the vice president of the Manhattan Plaza Tenant’s Association. She and the
members of her group oppose Spot Bar because it does not provide any of the needs of a
community that consists mainly of families with children.
David Stewart Mr. Stewart is the co-chair of the 45th Street Block Association. He acknowledged that the
owners of Spot Bar are good people, but he does not support their application because it
will put a liquor license in a place where there never has been one. The community needs
another type of business in that location. In terms of the allocation of supportive housing
versus affordable housing in general, he believes that there should be a thorough analysis of
relevant data before any decisions are made.
Michelle Lopez Ms. Lopez works in Hell’s Kitchen as an employee of GMHC. She is in her 30th year of
being afflicted with HIV. At her job, she screens people with HIV and AIDS who are
aging, and she has discovered that 90% of them do not have a stable and secure place to
live. She believes that providing affordable housing is a key part of ending the AIDS
epidemic.
Lian Valera Mr. Valera is a dietician who works with children in Brooklyn and lives across the street
from Manhattan Plaza on 9th Avenue. He voiced his support for all members of the
community, including those with HIV and AIDS who require affordable housing.

May 2020 Full Board Meeting Minutes
Presentation: NYC Dept. of Health and Mental Hygiene on the City’s Response to
COVID-19 and Testing
PRESENTATIONS /
PUBLIC HEARINGS
Pauline Ferrante is the Manhattan Community Liaison for the Office of
Consumer Affairs in the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. She appeared
at the request of the Board to give an update on the COVID-19 crisis.
Globally, there are more than 3.6 million reported cases and the City has 173,288
reported cases as of 1pm. The City also has 13,938 confirmed deaths and 5,359
probable deaths. A confirmed death is one where a party had a COVID-19 lab test
and a probable death is so classified when a City resident has not had a lab test, but
the Medical Examiner listed COVID-19 as the cause of death.
Because of the continuing widespread transmission rate of the virus, the City is
asking people to remain at home and the Governor has ordered the wearing of a face
covering when a person is outside and not able to maintain a six-foot distance from
others. Some businesses, such as grocery stores, can deny entry by anyone who is
not wearing a face covering.
The Governor has ordered non-essential businesses to remain closed until May
15, but that date might be extended in the City because of its high case count. The
City has also canceled all non-essential events through June; they include concerts,
rallies, parades, and other large gatherings. Also, all schools and colleges will
remain closed for the remainder of the school year.
The City is looking to hire more than 1,000 people to investigate and trace
COVID-19 cases and contacts once testing has become more available. There have
been several self-testing sites already set up around the City, and there will be many
more to come. More than a million residents have been tested and the City is
working to get 30,000 swabs analyzed by the end of the week. The City will also be
offering antibody testing for 150,000 health care workers and first responders.
Presentation: Change Impact on Community District 4 Community Needs
Assessment
Jen Curry reviewed the assessment of community needs in Manhattan
Community District 4 made by her consulting firm Change Impact. She explained
the methodology used in their research as being rooted in the following three
questions:
 What vulnerable populations are there in MCD4? What gaps in service do stakeholders perceive in the district? In other
words, who is not receiving the services they need?
 What additional information might MCB4 need to understand the
community and address its needs?
Analysis of the demographic data for the district includes the following:
 MCD4 has a smaller population of children and a higher concentration of
people between the ages of 25 and 44 years old than the City overall.
 MCD4 has a 59% White population, higher than the citywide rate of 32%.
 There are significantly fewer Blacks and Hispanics residing in the district in
comparison to the rest of the City. MCD4 also has fewer immigrants and
English language learners.
 There is extreme income inequality in MCD4, which has a median income
of $101,800 – the 6th highest of the City’s 59 community districts. Even
though 52% of residents earn $100,00 or more, most families fall at either
end of the income spectrum. There are 14,000 families with a household
income of $35,000 or less.
After synthesizing data and speaking with district stakeholders, Ms. Curry’s
group saw the following community needs emerge:
 Services for older adults.
 Employment for teenagers and young adults.
 Affordability of basic needs for families.
 Programs and housing for people experiencing homelessness and/or mental
illness.
Public Session
Joli Golden October 31 is the last day to respond to Census 2020. August 11 is the day when census
workers will begin visiting the homes of those who have not self-responded. Anyone who
is temporarily located at a place where they do not live most often should be sure to be
counted at the place where they stay most often in New York City. Residents of Manhattan
Plaza have demonstrated a 66.1% response rate, as opposed to the rest of the City at 46.1%.
Currently, the National response rate is 57.3%.
Christine Berthet The concept of “open streets,” which is the subject of Agenda Items 3 and 4, is the product
of the Mayor’s plan to create more open space for people who have been confined at home
because of the Covid-19 pandemic to safely walk in the streets while maintaining social
distancing requirements. Local traffic is permitted at 5 miles per hour, but through traffic is
barred except for emergency fire, police, and sanitation. Residents must apply to have their
block become an open street under the plan, which has specific published guidelines.
NYPD and DOT will deliver barriers to close off a street and the residents will set them up.
Chekpeds.com/open-streets has information about guidelines and where to buy signage.
Peter Stevens Mr. Stevens believes that the Board’s proposed letter to the LPC on the Tavros project in
the Gansevoort Historic District does not accurately represent the views of the community.
He takes the position that there will be 82 residential units lost in the community if the
project is approved. He does not want the Board to consider comparisons to buildings
outside the district and instead treat the area as a separate public resource. He and the
community members who have spoken out about the project do not see any public benefit
in the project.
Tom Cashin Mr. Cashin believes the Gansevoort project would be a destructive precedent and should
not be permitted. He views the proposal as being in complete contradiction to the
description given the project area in the Gansevoort Historic District designation report.Simona Stevens Ms. Stevens agrees with the statements made by Mr. Cashin and Peter Stevens, stressing
the loss of one of the last remaining historic blocks in the district. She asked the members
to avoid a compromise and recommend disapproval of the application in its entirety.
Stuart Davidoff Mr. Davidoff believes the Gansevoort project is inappropriate and out of place and scale
within the historic district. He asked that no development within the district be allowed if it
is visible from the street.
Jill Ford Ms. Ford questioned the process by which the Chelsea Land Use Committee decided to
propose a building in the Gansevoort District that is six stories tall. She wants the full
Board to consider new facts regarding affordable housing that have been discussed earlier
in the meeting and to reject the proposed building.
Yoni Bokser Mr. Bokser, who served on the Board for six years and was recently the Co-Chair of the
BLP Committee, announced his departure from the Board and thanked everyone for his
experience.
Bobby Vangelatos Mr. Vangelatos is the Deputy Center Manager at the Chelsea Recreation Center. He
mentioned the Parks Department initiative involving the distribution of face coverings and
noted that one can locate a distribution location on the Parks website by typing in a zip
code: https://maps.nyc.gov/face-coverings/ . He also noted that, with City parks being
closed. It was still possible to take virtual tours of the parks and engage in other activities
on the Parks Department website: https://www.nycgovparks.org/highlights/parks-at-home
.
Cheryl Gold Ms. Gold concurred with all of the previous speakers who are against the Gansevoort
project. She said she comes from a background of real estate developers and generally
favors new projects. In this case, however, she believes that the project goes against
everything the LPC has sought to preserve in the district. She says the project brings no
benefit to the community. She thinks the building will diminish the beauty of an iconic
corner in the Meatpacking District.
Lee Muller Mr. Muller wants the Board to represent the community’s collective views on the Tavros
project and, since the overwhelming view expressed at the committee meeting was against
it, the Board should go along with that position. He thinks the proposed building violates
the integrity of the historic district, no matter what its height might be.
Pamela Wolf Ms. Wolf is a public member of the Board and serves on the Land Use Committee and, as
such, is not a voting member at the general meeting. Speaking on behalf of the Chelsea
West 200 Block Association, Ms. Wolf voiced opposition to the Tavros Project. She also
indicated that members of her association were either strongly in favor or strongly opposed
to the open streets concept. Residents on West 22nd Street like the idea, while those on
21st Street do not. She asked for clarification on how this will be addressed in the final
plan.
Paul Koontz Mr. Koontz is completely against the Tavros project and believes that a building like the
one proposed has no place in the district.
Craig Slutzkin Mr. Slutzkin is the treasurer of the West 17th and 18th Streets Block Association. He has
consulted with neighboring block associations and found that none of them endorse the
Board’s open streets letter, mainly because they have not had time to discuss it. He also
noted a similar disharmony like the one previously mentioned by Pamela Wolf.
Jeffrey Brown Mr. Brown is the builder and developer of the Porterhouse, which is next door to the
proposed Tavros project. He acknowledged the experience and sophistication of the Tavros
team and he thinks the representations made in their proposal have been disingenuous in a
couple of respects. First, their reliance on the concept of an “edge condition” as
justification for the project using the comparison to the nearby Porterhouse and Samsungbuildings. And second, their claim that they are restoring historic buildings. He said
demolishing buildings cannot be considered restoration.
Noah Pfefferblit Mr. Pfefferblit lives in the area of the Tavros project and values the existing buildings and
thinks they add a great deal to the appeal of the area. He thinks the area would be adversely
affected by the proposed development and wants the Board to recommend rejection by the
LPC.
Remarks from Elected Officials
Congressman Over the past few months, three major stimulus packages were passed in Congress – the
Jerry Nadler largest in the nation’s history. A few weeks ago, HR266 (COVID 3.5) was passed
providing additional funding for small businesses covered by the CARES Act. The bill
included the Paycheck Protection Plan, and increased funding for hospitals and expanded
testing. However, this bill did not give state and local government funding and flexibility
to fight the virus. Therefore, the House is working on a fourth bill to give state and local
government more funding. There is hope that it will pass in the House next week. This bill
supports small businesses even further. It also provides funding for mail-in election ballots
for primary and general elections, if needed; increases food assistance funding; provides
funding for vital agencies such as the USPS; and increases funding for the MTA.
One of our past bills included a four-month moratorium on evictions. Now we are
looking to add $100 billion in emergency rental assistance, of which at least $10 billion
would go to New York. We would also have to add $25 billion for homeowner’s
assistance so that landlords can pay mortgages. We also need to put in funds for Section 8
and NYCHA. The Administration is not supporting much of this unless payroll tax cuts
are added to the bill. This, of course, would be unacceptable because it would be a blow to
Social Security and Medicare.
There have been issues with USPS not being able to provide daily mail service due to
staffing problems, but it looks like people should be getting at least two deliveries per
week for now.
Senator Brad The State budget deficit currently stands at between 10 and 17 billion dollars. The
Hoylman Legislature was able to pass a budget before the pandemic became worse, attending
“virtual” meetings to do so. My staff continues to work from home to keep everyone in the
office safe. Hearings are coming up and the Senate will be voting soon. One of the trigger
points for voting is the $10 billion in cuts that the Governor has announced. If he does
announce those cuts and the federal government does not come through with funding, then
the Legislature will have only 10 days to respond. Any budget cuts during a pandemic and
economic recession would be destructive to any recovery that we could expect to see. So,
if the feds do not come through, then the State will have to look for other sources of
revenue.
The NYPD tow pound will no longer be on Pier 76; it was a twenty-year effort that
included the help of CB4, Assemblymember Gottfried, and the Governor.
I have introduced several COVID-related bills:
 Regarding the spate of price gouging in the sale of such items as face masks, PPE
items, and medical devices, the Attorney General would be given new powers to go
after price gougers throughout the state. A bill to bring back subway service to normal levels once social distancing
measures have been relaxed.
 A bill to extend the Governor’s moratorium on evictions that will expire on June 18.
The bill would prohibit evictions for six months following the declaration of a state
of emergency.
Anyone who is experiencing problems applying for a new or extended claim for
unemployment benefits should call Maia Berlow in the district office for assistance. She has
been successful in helping a large number of constituents in recent weeks.
President Gale In a big win for CB4, a judge ruled in favor of the residents of an SRO on West 19th
Brewer Street, awarding them $140,000.
I spoke to Steve Banks regarding the fate of the homeless people who have been
relocated to hotels. We need a plan for them after the pandemic has eased. CB4 needs to be
ready to deal with the myriad issues related to bars and restaurants as well. The Board’s
continued input will be important on the question of the implementation of the open-streets
program.
I have also been dealing with the many questions regarding contact tracing, such as the
need for more COVID-19 testing sites and treatment for those who have tested positive. I
have also been speaking to our Community Education Councils – all whose members I
appoint – regarding the great number of children living in temporary housing and the things
that must be done to open schools in the Fall.
Upcoming events include a meeting on May 12 with Congressman Nadler regarding
contact tracing and a meeting on May 15 about the need for more social workers in schools.
Assemblymember Many constituents have been calling about unemployment insurance complaining that
Linda B. they have no money to live on and that the antiquated computer system at the Department of
Rosenthal Labor has made it impossible to apply for benefits or get follow-up phone calls once they
have applied. Another complaint has to do with the DOL continuing to apply forfeit
penalties to state benefit payments right from the beginning instead of applying those
penalties at the end of the claim period. On top of that, the penalties are eating into the
additional $600 weekly federal payment. I have joined in a bill with State Senator Monica
Martinez to remedy this.
These are some of the matters that I have been addressing in recent days:
 I had the DOT issue a stop-work order to a building under construction near my
office on West 72nd Street because it had erroneously been deemed “essential
construction” for containing the requisite number of affordable units.
 Taking inspiration from the activism of CB4, I wrote a letter to the City’s asking
that the streets be opened as soon as possible. And even though the open-streets
program has begun with streets near parks, I believe the program has to be expanded
quickly in other areas.
 I sent letters to the City and State reinforcing the message that it is time for the tow
pound to be moved off of Pier 76.
 I introduced a bill that would prevent food delivery services such as Grubhub and
Seamless from charging a service fee during the COVID-19 crisis.
 I introduced a bill, co-sponsored by Luis Sepulveda in the Senate, to shut down live
markets because of the public health risk that they pose as sources of viruses like
COVID-19 that jump from animals to humans. The bill would place a moratorium
on the operation of such markets and establish a task force to examine the public
health risks to their use.Remarks from Representatives of Elected Officials
Erik Bottcher for Mr. Bottcher offered the following updates:
Council Speaker  The Speaker’s office has been working diligently on the COVID-19 crisis response.
Corey Johnson There are 80 volunteers from the community who have been making thousands of
calls to seniors in the Council District to check on their wellbeing and needs. The
focus has been on food insecurity and a $25,000 contribution was obtained from the
Highline board, as well as a $25,000 contribution from IAC for 2,200 pantry boxes.
The boxes have gone out to seniors, and residents of NYCHA, Penn South, and
Clinton Housing Development buildings.
 The Speaker has continued to work on other problems along with the COVID-9
response, including issues related to housing, sanitation, and transportation. He and
the staff have been working with constituents seven days a week.
 As to the Open Streets policy, he thanked the Board for getting its letter out in time
to influence the Mayor in setting his Open Streets agenda. The DOT released on
Friday the guidelines for implementing the policy as well as the application for
organizations wishing to participate in the program. He asked those organizations
that wish to participate to come forward. He also wants to hear the input from those
who do not.
 The office has been working hard on public safety and dealing with all of the
precincts in District 3, which runs from Canal Street up to Columbus Circle. Daily
talks are had with commanding officers and community affairs officers in the half
dozen precincts in the district on various ongoing issues, including homelessness.
Luke Wolf for Mr. Wolf made the following announcements:
Comptroller  The office has put together a comprehensive resource center for COVID-19 related
Scott Stringer matters at https://comptroller.nyc.gov/services/for-the-public/covid-19-resource-
center/english/overview/
 The budget analysis was released yesterday and can be found at
https://comptroller.nyc.gov/newsroom/comptroller-stringer-releases-analysis-of-fy-
2021-executive-budget/
 The Comptroller is looking at about a $9 billion budget gap for the rest of this year
and next year, which is twice as deep as the Great Recession. There are 900,000
New Yorkers who are unemployed, which amounts to about one in five New
Yorkers.
 The Comptroller put out two COVID related reports: Who are the Front-Line
Workers, and a suite of policy recommendations that the City should take to make
sure all are protected during the duration of the crisis. A study on housing and air
quality was also conducted by the office.
 Last week was Earth Week and the Comptroller took a couple of measures in
relation to it: 1) a call on all major insurance companies to sever ties with the coal
industry; 2) led a successful “vote no campaign” that prevented a J.P. Morgan
director from getting an independent board seat due to his climate denial stance;
and, 3) called for a stop to the Keystone Pipeline.

Chair
JESSE R. BODINE
District Manager
June 2020 Full Board Meeting Minutes
Chair’s Opening Statement: We're still trying to figure out a way forward in the
face of COVID-19 which affected people of color disproportionately. We are reeling
PRESENTATIONS /
once again from the murder of a person of color at the hands of those meant to protect
PUBLIC HEARINGS
us: the police. We are seeing devastation not seen since the Great Depression. As a
result, we have had lockdowns to control the spread of the coronavirus. And we have
local businesses that have been devastated by rioters and looters who took advantage
of the chaos and disorder for their own benefit. We are facing multiple traumas now
due to a lack of leadership – both at the federal level and at City Hall. I think, as
community leaders, even if this board serves only in an advisory capacity, there are
things we can do to make life easier for everyone in our city.
At the early stages of the pandemic, Eric Bottcher secured donations from Friends
of the High Line and the IEC to provide pantry-stable food to those in need. I am
pleased to announce that the Hell’s Kitchen Hudson Yards Alliance, let by our former
district manager Bob Benfatto, has to date secured enough funding for Manhattan
CD4 to have another 500 boxes of pantry-stable food to deliver.
As a next step, there is an action we can take tonight. I am going to propose a New
Business letter to Mayor de Blasio imploring him to have the NYPD focused on
preventing looters and rioters and leaving peaceful protesters alone. Additionally, I
am going to convene a working group to explore what recommendations we can make
to the Mayor to combat the institutional racism of the NYPD. Some obvious answers
have already been suggested, such as the repeal of Section 50-a of the New York
Civil Rights Law that shields police officers’ disciplinary history from public
scrutiny. There is more that can be done, and the working group will prepare a letter
to the Mayor with a list of recommendations that will be approved at the July
meeting. Finally, I am going to reconvene the Small Business Working Group, led by
Burt Lazarin, to investigate measures that can be taken to help small businesses in our
district which have suffered losses, whether due to the coronavirus looting or
otherwise.
Presentation: CB4 Commendation to Avenues School, 259 10th Avenue for
Volunteer Efforts During COVID19 Epidemic
Board Member Inge Ivchenko began the presentation with a statement describing
Avenues School the World School. The school exists to create future world leaders
uniquely equipped to solve global-scale problems. It provides a transformative world-
focused learning experience in key cities and countries around the globe, enabling
their graduates to strive during a time of unprecedented and accelerating challenge andchange. The Avenues New York campus is based in Chelsea and is part of a growing
network of campuses, including Sao Paolo, Brazil, Shenzhen, China, and online. Its
community values are composed of three pillars: welcome, safety, and respect. These
pillars are universally honored by students, parents, alumni, faculty, and staff across
the Avenues campuses. Avenues has made a real effort to become a member of the
Chelsea neighborhood, and much of the credit goes to Morgan Jones, the director of
community engagement and partnerships.
While the COVID-19 pandemic tragedy has touched us all, it allowed Avenues to
shine as a beacon of hope, helpfulness, and leadership. A recent example of their
generosity was the provision of 360 care packages to families in temporary shelters in
our district. They also jumped into a letter-writing campaign and made it part of the
curriculum. They donated money to the EMT station in Chelsea and sent food to
emergency workers at hospitals around the city.
Morgan Jones thanked the board for this commendation and introduced Ava Laden,
an 11th grader who worked with 25 student volunteers and faculty to make 500 masks
that were donated to community groups within the district. He then played a video in
which the girl scouts from Troop 3762 talked about the fundraiser they held that
enabled them to donate lunch to 250 medical workers and 500 more to the Holy
Apostles soup kitchen.
Public Session
Larry Roberts Mr. Roberts asked a question regarding the letter to the Governor in Agenda Item 10 that
asks for the installation of a bike lane along the West Side Highway. He was seeking to
know whether any research was done before the letter was drafted. He likened the approach
to that which led to the Open Streets program which made West 51st Street an open block
with disastrous results. He wants the board to reconsider its position.
Carla Fine Ms. Fine complained about the response of the 10th Precinct to an incident at Clement
Moore Park the previous week. She said there were about 12 young men who entered the
park on dirt bikes who rode around the park shouting obscenities at people who tried to
stop them. Ms. Fine called 311, 911 and the NCO, but got no response for over an hour.
Finally, a patrol car came up 10th Avenue with the siren on and an officer just rolled down
the window and kept moving. When Ms. Fine heard of the same kind of response by the
10th Precinct to the looting that was taking place a few days later, she filed a formal
complaint at the precinct.
Jon Mandel Mr. Mandel spoke about a party of about 100 people that congregated on the 400 block of
West 51st Street this past Saturday as a result of the block becoming an Open Street under
the Mayor’s new program. He complained about people drinking, not wearing masks, and
not social distancing. He blamed the Posh Bar for much of the problem and noted that Posh
has not been a good neighbor in the past. He wants the Board to aid in getting the City to
enforce the rules on Open Streets.
Graig Linn Mr. Linn, of the 49-54 Block Association, commented on his experience on Saturday when
he first was notified by the City that his block was eligible to be an Open Street. He noted
that the DOT quickly put up a barricade but did not supply signage setting out the rules
governing Open Streets. That prompted him to make his own signs and stand outside for
two days to explain what was happening. He stated that people, including the Posh Bar,
wanted to comply with the rules and they did. Posh closed its doors promptly at 8 pm each
day and served food as well. He is asking that, in the future, there should be sufficientnotice, proper signage, and a plan. Mr. Linn went on to complain about the lack of notice
with respect to new temporary shelters being opened in the neighborhood.
Dave Duke Mr. Duke thinks that opening a bike lane along the West Side Highway is something the
Board should reconsider. He is concerned that people who live in the City and use their
cars to commute to and from work would be inconvenienced even more than they already
are with congested streets and highways.
Remarks from Elected Officials
Assemblymember Mr. Gottfried reported that his office began receiving calls early Tuesday morning
Dick Gottfried regarding the looting and violence taking place the night before in Chelsea, particularly
around 9th Avenue and 20th Street. He learned from eyewitness reports that it had nothing
to do with the peaceful protests but was simply criminal looting by an organized group of
people taking advantage of the situation. Upon seeing photos of these incidents, he
immediately sent an email to the 10th Precinct stating that there did not appear to be
anything close to an effective response by the police. He stated that it took them over an
hour to respond – long after the looters had left – and this was all happening only a block
and a half away from the station house.
The Senate and Assembly will be convening in Albany with many members doing so
virtually. They will be taking up a package of bills dealing with the issue of police reform.
One that has gotten a lot of attention is Section 50-a of the NYS Civil Rights Law, which
makes confidential all police officer personnel records. It is unique in New York and
conceals from public view all records of misconduct and abuse. Mr. Gottfried voted against
passage of Section 50-a in 1976 and has been pushing for its repeal ever since. He is a co-
sponsor of a bill to repeal it and he is hoping it will finally happen next week.
There has been a major problem with the spread of COVID-19 in our nursing homes. It is
as serious as it is because of decades of state policy and practice concerning nursing homes.
The state has tolerated understaffing in nursing homes and the state’s corps of inspectors
have been seriously understaffed. Enforcement has been as lax as ever. Soon, there will be
public hearings on this in the Assembly Health Committee, which Mr. Gottfried chairs. He
is working with the Senate health committee on this as well.
Mr. Gottfried has long taken the position that there should a bigger share of taxes on
ultra-high wealth because much of the tax burden in New York has fallen on working
people. To make matters worse, we are underserved when it comes to housing, mass transit,
education, health care, and a host of other things. He has been working with a coalition in
the legislature to raise more revenue from high wealth to deal with the consequences of
COVID-19 as well as the longstanding lack of services that New Yorkers have been
suffering.
Senator Brad Following up on Mr. Gottfried’s words, the Senator stated that he was looking forward to
Hoylman getting back to Albany to take up the package of bills on police brutality and racial injustice.
Among the bills being considered are:
• Repeal of Section 50-a of the Civil Rights Law.
• The Senator’s bill known as the Police STAT Act which for the first time would
require police departments across New York State to record and report information
on who is arrested and ticketed, what race they are, where it happened, and how
many people are dying in police custody.• Legislation that would codify the Governor's Executive Order establishing the State
Attorney General as a special prosecutor for police violence.
• The Eric Garner Anti-Chokehold Act which would make it a class B felony for
police officers to cause serious physical injury or death to a person using a
prohibited chokehold maneuver.
The Senator co-signed a letter with Assemblymember Gottfried asking that the NYPD
move resources from their surveillance of protesters to protecting our personal property. He
believes that the protesters are doing a good job by themselves.
Among the 31 COVID-related bills that were passed last week was the Senator’s bill to
allow pharmacists to administer a vaccine once one becomes available. Parents have been
reluctant during the pandemic to take their children to a doctor’s office for a vaccine and
having pharmacists available in their neighborhoods would make them more likely to do so.
The Tenants Safe Harbor Act, which was introduced by the Senator, passed in both chambers of
the Legislature last week. It protects residential tenants who have suffered financial hardship during
the COVID-19 pandemic. The Act allows only money judgments, and not evictions, for unpaid
rent that comes due while restrictions are in place due to COVID-19.
Borough Ms. Brewer spoke of a press conference that she had attended hours earlier that was
President Gale organized by the chair of Community Board 12 in Washington Heights. Its purpose was to
Brewer resolve tensions between Latino and African American youths that began when a group of
Dominican youths who were protecting stores from looters confronted a group of peaceful
African Americans. The press conference was a success.
Ms. Brewer, like Senator Hoylman, attended several rallies to show her support for the
protesters. She toured the Meatpacking and SoHo BIDs over the past couple of days and
believes her involvement was helpful. She suggested that some bridges and tunnels be shut
down during the curfew to keep out vehicles with out-of-town plates and concealed plates as
a way to minimize looting and disruption. This was done.
Ms. Brewer has taken an interest in the new uses of outdoor spaces that have been
proposed. She also welcomes the latest development in COVID tracing, which involves
testing for the virus at the City’s water treatment facilities, and she has been in contact with
the DEP about it. This is currently being done in other parts of the world, so DEP should
review it as part of the City’s plan for tracing and testing.
The Borough President is continuing work in:
• Food security for seniors and the use of Fresh Direct.
• Fighting for the arts and participating in the bi-weekly virtual meetings being held
by two uptown arts groups.
• Pushing the City Council to enable the Summer Youth Program.
• The Police Athletic League hiring about 100 interns over the Summer.
• Getting tutors for 178,000 students who will be enrolled in Summer School.
• Having full time, culturally-appropriate social workers in every school.
On Tuesday, June 16, Rob Snyder, the Borough Historian will be holding a virtual forum
from 2-4 pm on the topic of oral history and way to archive the coronavirus pandemic.
Council Member The Council Member noted that the City is required by law to have a budget by the end
Helen Rosenthal of June and that she is a member of the budget negotiating team. The City is facing a $10
billion revenue shortfall and a likely $3 billion shortfall in state aid. So, with a $93 billionbudget, that represents over 10% of the City’s operating expenses that have to be worked
out. It will have to be determined which cuts are necessary and where additional revenue
might be found so that important social services are not interrupted, and firehouses not
closed. Two obvious state laws can be changed to provide more revenue and the easiest one
to pass would eliminate the automatic rebate of securities transfer tax. The tax was enacted
in 1905 and was imposed the moment a security was bought or sold; it amounted to only
pennies on the dollar. But in the 1980s, the current law was passed that provides for an
automatic rebate of the tax to the brokerage houses. Now, seems to be the perfect time to
eliminate the rebate because, during the pandemic, the only individuals who made any
money were the brokerage houses on Wall Street. By law, any revenues gained by the tax
would be split evenly between the City and the State. And while there are bills in Albany to
eliminate the rebate, they are pre-COVID and include provisions on where the revenues can
be spent. But with the City now in a revenue crisis, the focus should be more on gathering
revenue that was lost during COVID than on spending.
In the course of negotiating the budget, the Council Member has been receiving calls and
emails about taking money away from the NYPD and adding money to social service and
human service programs. One Ms. Rosenthal’s colleagues who is not on the negotiating
team feels that it is unfair to punish the NYPD this way and that, if it is police behavior that
needs improvement, then there should be other solutions. One that she has suggested would
be to require any officer who is transferred to a new precinct to complete 90 hours of
community service in the new community to become familiar with people there and what
their needs are. This is an idea that Ms. Rosenthal supports.
Remarks from Representatives of Elected Officials
Kevin Jean Mr. Jean Baptiste provided updates on activities during the time of COVID-19:
Baptiste for D.A. • The office has responded to numerous complaints of price gouging and instances of
Cyrus Vance people attempting to scam others into providing personal information. The office set
up an email portal where these issues can be reported:
fraudcomplaints@dany,nyc.gov
• At this time last year, the office saw no complaints or assaults against Asian
Americans, but this year there have been 11 that the office is investigating. The
D.A. is ramping up his campaign against hate crimes and encourages people is to
use his hotline to report them.
• The D.A. responded to concerns about people being quarantined with an abusive
partner during the pandemic by creating a list of resources that can be found at
https://www.manhattanda.org/victim-resources/domestic-violence/
• The D.A. released a statement regarding putting an end to excessive force by the
police. It can be found here https://www.manhattanda.org/statement-by-d-a-

Minutes
District Manager Report Highlights of events the District Manager or Staff attended on behalf of the Board
and upcoming events:o District Manager met with new Breaking Ground Homeless
Outreach Leadership to review the impact that looting, curfew, and
Covid-19 has had on street outreach teams. Positive news: they are
still touring 24/7 and 8 additional teams of outreach specialists will
be coming online shortly.
o District Office is forwarding all reports of stores being vandalized
to the Mayor’s office and Small Business Services.
o MCB4 closed two of its three short term consultant contracts. We
now have a preliminary community needs assessment and a report
of dangerous intersections in our neighborhood.
o June Committee Updates and Board Reminders:
o All June Committee meetings are meeting at their regular date and
time and will be held remotely using zoom. The links to attend all
of these meetings are on our website.
o Reminder: July’s Full Board meeting will be held on Wednesday,
July 22nd.
The Chair reviewed his activities during the past month:
Board Chair Report • He and the District Manager met with all of the new members to welcome
them and review committee assignments.
• There have been many meetings with DHS and service providers regarding
the new shelters in the District and the lack of notice to the community
before their opening. He is continuing to pursue a remedy for that.
• There was a call last night regarding issues at the Lantern Shelter and things
appear to be improving.
• ACES is holding a virtual forum on the reopening of schools in the age of
COVID-19 on June 8 at 6:30 pm. Sign up links are on the CB4 website.
• ACES is holding a meeting next week to find ways to help theatres during
the pandemic.
• During this General Meeting, he reviewed the Open Streets program with
Christine Berthet. She reported that she observed six of the seven approved
blocks that were approved for opening and they were working well. She
confirmed that there was a lack of notice and proper signage. Her most
distressing observations were of people congregating in groups everywhere
along 51st Street and 9th Avenue where they were drinking and disobeying
the rules of masking and social distancing. She believes that it comes as a
consequence of the relaxation of the open container law. The Chair added
that the BLP Committee would be taking up the legislation introduced by
Senator Hoylman to extend the pick-up and delivery rules that are enforced
by the SLA.
• The Chair asking for volunteers for the new working group being set up to
deal with NYPD and its race relations issues.
• He reminded everyone to vote in the June primaries and to complete the
census.Motions, Amendments, &

District Manager
July 2020 Full Board Meeting Minutes
Public Hearing: Scoping Hearing on Draft Environmental Impact Statement on Empire
Station Complex
PRESENTATIONS /
PUBLIC HEARINGS
Paul Devlin, the co-chair of the Chelsea Land Use Committee, explained the purpose
of the hearing and the nature of the development proposed by Empire State
Development. The Board’s input on the scope of the environmental impact study is
due by August 20 and is contained in the letter to ESD that is the subject of Agenda
Item 22. Mr. Devlin asked for comments from the public, but no speakers came
forward and the hearing was closed.
Public Session
Amr Kotb Mr. Kotb is a government and community affairs staff member of the New York Public
Library which, he announced, has reopened at 8 branches with grab-and-go services. They are re-
evaluating as they go for reopening more branches. The NYPL has started its virtual summer reading
program and is distributing book kits in tandem with DOE.
Lisa Wager Ms. Wager is the Director of the Office of Government Relations at the Fashion Institute of
Technology. She announced the college would be opening in the Fall with in-person and
remote learning options. She also noted that the noted the new Black Students Union mural
is up on the outside of the building.
Owen Sweeney Mr. Owens is the former head of HR for Breaking Ground, the largest supportive housing
network in the country. He was the first speaker of the evening to complain about the
homeless shelters on West 36th and West 37th Streets. He stated that poor management has
caused conditions at the shelters to get out of control and that the quality of life on his
block continues to decline. He would like to see these new shelters shut down.
Anita McDonagh Ms. McDonagh was the first speaker of the evening among many who voiced her
opposition to the liquor license application of The Spot bar – the subject of Agenda Item 6.
She cited the history of the applicant’s other bars, especially Rise Bar, as establishments
where the rules were ignored and violated repeatedly.
Marie Emms Ms. Emms, a resident of The Piano Factory, located at 10th Avenue and 45th Street, is also
opposed to The Spot opening on 10th Avenue and 44th Street because of the history of
another one of the applicant’s bars in Hell’s Kitchen that is now closed – Bar-Tini, which
was the subject of numerous noise complaints.
Elizabeth Carfioli Another resident of The Piano Factory, Ms. Carfioli, said she would welcome another bar
in the neighborhood to replace Lansdowne Road, but not Spot Bar.Tracy Choi Ms. Choi is the manager of Rise Bar, which she claims operates like a local bar, not a nightclub.
She stated that they provide a safe environment for their guests and are proactive in lower noise.
There have been no incidents that needed policed assistance.
Adrienne Ford Ms. Ford spoke out against The Spot arguing that when Lansdowne Road was granted its
liquor license in 2004, there were not three schools nearby. Now we have PS 51, Beacon
High School, and Success Academy, all just barely beyond the limitations of the 200-Foot
Rule that applies to liquor licenses. The landscape of the neighborhood, in general, has
changed over the past five years or so. Ms. Ford made a point of her speaking on behalf of
the tenants of Manhattan Plaza where she serves as the vice president of the tenant’s
association.
Charles Cange Mr. Cange is a resident of West 49th Street and a member of the LGBT community who is
seeking the help of the Board in making contact with our elected officials regarding the use
of a federal grant of $500,000 to study bullying and mental health in the gay community.
He stated that the grant was given to Lehman College, but was turned down because of
concerns about being able to fulfill its requirements.
Brian Weber Mr. Weber is a public member of Clinton/Hell’s Kitchen Land Use Committee and a
resident of West 36th Street between 8th and 9th Avenues. Speaking on his own behalf,
Mr. Weber echoed the remarks of Owen Sweeney earlier concerning the temporary shelters
in his neighborhood. He added that the combined population of these shelters is over 800
people in a one-block radius – a density that has given rise to numerous crimes and
negative interactions with his neighbors. The temporary residents in question were moved
from other locations in the city and represent 40% of the total population of those who were
moved. He wants the shelter population reduced for the safety and well-being of his
neighbors and local business owners.
Bruce MacAffer Mr. MacAffer is a former member of the Board and the BLP Committee. He lives at 43rd
and 10th Avenue and spoke in favor of The Spot application, stating that The Spot is not
much different from Lansdowne Road in terms of capacity and hours of operation. He said
it should not matter that it is a drag bar instead of a sports bar.
Sean Reilly Mr. Reilly is a researcher for Service Employees Union Local 32 BJ which represents over
3,300 workers who either live or work in Manhattan CD4. He has spoken against the
application of Chipotle in June at the BLP Committee and has been fighting for the rights
of workers at other Chipotle restaurants for the past year and a half. The fast-food industry
disproportionately serves and employs underage youth. Chipotle follows this trend and
targets teenagers. But unlike other fast-food chains, it serves liquor in various forms. And,
although it serves liquor at its more than 80 restaurants in the City, it does not do so in New
Jersey and does fine there without alcohol. It is illegal for minors under 18 to serve and
handle alcohol in New York. Local 32BJ has filed four complaints against Chipotle for
allowing minors as young as 16 to serve alcohol at its restaurants. The Local has brought
these concerns to three other community boards in the City and each one has voted against
any new liquor licenses for Chipotle.
David Serrano Mr. Serrano has lived at 46th and 10th Avenue for ten years. He stated that he is a regular
at Rise Bar, which he described as an older, more sophisticated bar that is not rowdy. He
expects The Spot to be similar to Rise and welcomes its arrival, especially because the
block that it is on is now devoid of other businesses and has become a homeless
encampment area.
Daniel Kelley The speaker is a resident of Manhattan Plaza and stressed the safety issues in the
neighborhood as being the main reason for his support of The Spot bar, which will keep the
block lit up at night and have doormen outside. He does not consider Rise to be a rowdy
bar and The Spot will not be one either.Aviva Wheeler Ms. Wheeler lives on West 43rd Street between 9th and 10th Avenues. She believes that
the neighborhood will be safer with The Spot in operation at night and is in favor of its
application.
Marisa Redanty Ms. Redanty is a district leader and president emeritus of the Manhattan Plaza tenant’s
association, which is opposed to The Spot bar. She stated that the association is by law the
duly-appointed voice of the tenants and has been recognized as such in its dealings with the
Board. She does not believe that The Spot Bar will have any effect on the homelessness
problem in the neighborhood and is against its application to the SLA.
Latoya Leflore Ms. Leflore has worked in partnership with the Rise Bar in raising funds for charities that
help homeless LGBT youth. So, from a community perspective, the addition of The Spot
and its management team to the neighborhood is welcomed.
David Beatty Mr. Beatty recounted his experience observing a homeless man stealing food from a Duane
Reade store on 9th Avenue and being told by employees that they are aware of his daily
thefts and are unable to stop him because of instructions from management and the lack of
police involvement. He complained that all of the shelters in the area are being
mismanaged to the detriment of the community. He is in favor of The Spot bar.
Brett Rieben Mr. Rieben lives on 10th Avenue near the intended location of The Spot bar. He is a
frequent patron of the Rise Bar and considers it to be the cleanest and well-run bar that he
knows of in the City. He noted the recent closing of several gay bars in the neighborhood
and welcomes The Spot bar for filling that void and adding jobs for the community.
Timothy Guest Mr. Guest lives above the Rise Bar and said noise has never been an issue, unlike what
goes on at other bars in the area. He supports The Spot bar.
David Stuart Mr. Stuart has been a resident for 25 years and a community leader for a decade. He stated
that the sense he is getting from the discussion about The Spot bar is that it will have an
outsized impact on the community. He agrees with that and referred to the letters and
petitions submitted by the attorney for the applicant that came from people living outside
the City. He mentioned his own letter to the BLP Committee.
Christopher Mr. Victor is a dancer who is grateful for the work provided to him by the owners of the
Victor Rise Bar who he believes are responsible and strict managers. He said that during his time
at the Rise Bar he has not experienced any drama or heard of any noise complaints.
Jon Mandel Mr. Mandel lives on the 400 block of West 51st Street where, he said, the Open
Restaurants program has been working favorably. He raised an issue that he is seeking the
help of the Board with: he would like our elected officials to put pressure on the NYPD to
patrol the block more often to deal with problems such as people who bring sound systems
and use their car radios to play loud music late into the night. He stated that calls to 911
and 311 have done nothing to mitigate the noise. He noted that the efforts of the council
member representing Astoria were effective in getting the NYPD to respond.
Thomas Lepri Mr. Lepri lives on West 36th Street near 8th Avenue. He echoed the statements of Owen
Sweeney and Brian Weber regarding temporary shelters. He said the huge influx of new
people in the neighborhood has dramatically changed the quality of life there with residents
fearful of leaving their apartments during the day and night because of the numerous
violent incidents they have either experienced or witnessed.
Xabian Ramirez Mr. Ramirez, who lives at 54th Street and 10th Avenue, supports The Spot bar and noted
that during the pandemic, the Rise Bar has been following all of the rules and rule changes
covering the take-out program.
Darren Major Mr. Major is a member of the Gay Football League and has been a partner with the Rise
Bar in raising funds for LGBT youth. He said he feels safe and supported by those in
charge of Rise and supports The Spot.Theodore Arenas Mr. Arenas is one of the owners of The Spot. He noted that he received 140 letters of
support from residents of Manhattan Plaza. He addressed the issues regarding Bar-Tini
raised earlier, stating that he was the reason for the bar closing. He stated that he asked the
SLA to remove his name from their liquor license because his partners brought someone in
to run the bar with no experience who allowed problems to persist. He does not want to be
associated with the problems of Rise during 2013 and 2014 because they were not his fault,
having left in 2011. As to noise complaints at Rise, he said there were 5 noise complaints
over three and a half years. He noted that 33 out of 48 tenants who live above Rise Bar
support his application.
Allen Azarkin Mr. Azarkin is an architect at the consultancy firm Building Violation Services who has
worked with Mr. Arenas over the years to ensure that Rise Bar remains in compliance with
all building code regulations. He stated that Mr. Arenas is one of the most upstanding
individuals that he has worked with in the hospitality industry and looks forward to
working with him at The Spot.
Guy Crowl Mr. Crowl lives at Manhattan Plaza with his wife. He recounted an incident where he was
asked by someone in his building to sign a petition relating to an issue with Bar-Tini. When
he asked the petitioner whether they knew of Bar-Tini, Rise Bar, or Ted Arenas, they said
no, this was simply a petition against another gay bar opening in the neighborhood. Mr.
Crowl said he has attended fundraisers at the Rise Bar and met Mr. Arenas. He supports
The Spot and thinks it will be a better venue than Lansdowne Road.
Aleta LaFargue Ms. LaFargue is the president of the Manhattan Plaza tenant’s association, which she says
represents over 3,500 residents. She stated that 800 units in the complex are across the
street from the proposed location of The Spot. She also stated that the residents have
directed her to speak for them against the proposal. She disputes the veracity of the owners
when they promise to maintain crowd control and maintains that the petitions signed on
behalf of the owners are meaningless. She wants the Board to view The Spot as a
nightclub, not simply a bar.
Amy Fusselman Ms. Fusselman also echoed the earlier comments about the shelters on West 36th Street
where she lives with her two children. She said the quality of life has been so degraded
with the influx of shelter residents that she and her family cannot even turn left when
coming out of their home.
Ann Miller Ms. Miller lives on West 36th Street and has managed buildings there as well. She echoes
all of the previous comments about the conditions on her block. She is most upset by the
police not responding to 911 calls about open drug use. As a building manager, she has
gotten flooded with emails from tenants complaining about sexual assaults and threatening
behavior. She said tenants are moving out of the neighborhood, including doctors who are
moving their practices. She wants to get the drug use problem dealt with and the
misbehaving shelter residents moved.
Ellen Pearlstein Ms. Pearlstein, who lives in the same building as Amy Fusselman, spoke along with her
father, Phillip. She said that her block has become a terrible place to live and that the plan
to move 800 people into shelters overnight without considering security was an ill-
conceived notion from the start. She stated that conditions are so horrible that no one in her
family ever feels safe to leave the house.
Rashaan James Mr. James is a resident of Manhattan Plaza who stated that the tenant’s association does not
speak for him because he is part of a new group of tenants who are younger and not set in
the old ways of the complex. He said that he was a constant patron of Lansdowne Road and
favors The Spot taking over the space.
Will Schwarz Mr. Schwarz reiterated the state of crisis that exists on West 36th Street. He said that, even
though he lives right next door to a police precinct, he is still unsafe because the policehave given up on trying to remedy the situation. He stated he is followed every time he
goes out to the store and that the block has essentially been destroyed overnight.
Donald Bernstein Mr. Bernstein is the attorney for The Spot. He thanked the BLP Committee for its
recommendation for approval. Addressing the issue of the petitions that he submitted, he
stated that they contained 759 signatures of local residents, 420 of whom live south of West
48th Street and 329 of whom live above West 49th Street. Also, 137 signatures were
obtained in Manhattan Plaza along with 8 letters that came independently from Manhattan
Plaza. As a testament to how the Rise Bar is operated, 33 out of the 48 tenants who live
above the Rise Bar support the applicants.
Artsiom Khaklin Mr. Khaklin is a resident of Hell’s Kitchen who supports The Spot because its presence
will make the streets safer. He also appreciates the fact that the applicants provide jobs to
the gay community.
Kathleen Treat Ms. Treat began with the statement “Spot is not Rise” to convey the idea that the patrons of
The Spot will come from the “bridge and tunnel” crowd and not from the neighborhood.
She accused the applicants of having a history of not abiding by the stipulations in their
liquor licenses and that one can expect the same when it comes to The Spot bar.
Remarks from Elected Officials
Assemblymember Yesterday, I submitted testimony on the Empire Station issues. I want to thank CB4 and
Dick Gottfried CB5 for helping us frame those issues. And I think we are all in agreement on what needs to
be happening on the scoping.
We have been hearing a lot about the homeless in hotels and it is a bad situation. We heard
that 2,000 hotel residents have been moved into the district and I do not think the district can
sustain that. We are looking forward with CB4 and elected officials to clear up this situation.
On a related point, the reason we have so much trouble in the City with housing and
behavior that stems from people with mental problems, is that New York has been working
on an austerity budget for several decades. There are New Yorkers with huge wealth who
are under-taxed, and our city suffers because of that in terms of housing, health care,
education, and transportation. We have to remedy that. I am part of a large group of
legislators who have been fighting to get taxes on ultra-high wealth.
The Assembly Health Committee, which I chair, will having public hearings in August on
the COVID epidemic and its effect on nursing homes, home care and hospitals. Contact our
office for details and if you wish to testify.
Borough Following up on the earlier 51st Street discussion with Jon Mandel, I have been there and
President Gale would be glad to go back if there is a problem.
Brewer
Regarding the Governor’s GPP at Penn Station – his version of ULURP – we will be
making our comments before August 20th. Thank you to CB4 and CB5 for your work on
that and holding hearings on the topic.
I want the people on West 36th and West 37th Streets to be relieved so we are trying to get
rid of the kiosks in this area because they are contributing to the problems there. The same is
happening in other areas of the City. In my opinion, the non-profits running the shelters are
not doing their jobs. We are going to listing for the Department of Homeless Services a
whole number of things that need to be done.I have been up and down 9th Avenue visiting restaurants and many of them are doing the
right thing in terms of outdoor dining.
On August 11th paid census takers are going to be knocking on the doors of people who
have not filled out the census. We are not doing well on the numbers and there are 420,000
New Yorkers who left the City during the pandemic and they are hard to track down.
Garbage is terrible and there is no Sunday pick up. There has been a 63% cut in weekday
service and there are no more pickups of organics. NYU has a year-long study on organics
going on, so hopefully we can bring it back.
Affordable housing has been hurt by budgets cuts. We have been talking to builders and
the banks and we are putting together a task force to determine what affordable housing
programs should look like in the Borough of Manhattan.
I worked on a Black Lives Matter mural in Foley Square with three African American
artists.
I am concerned about the schools re-opening in the Fall and I will try to call every school
in the borough to see what is needed. The aim is to be flexible because these kids are not
learning.
Sign up for our newsletter – I think it’s fabulous.
As a reminder, the URLURP timetable will be opening up again and we will be working
with City Planning Commission on many issues.
Remarks from Representatives of Elected Officials
Eric Bottcher for Mr. Bottcher gave his monthly update:
Speaker Corey  Although it was difficult to arrive at a final budget in trying times, the Speaker was
Johnson able to allocate $5 million in capital funding for the NYCHA Elliott-Chelsea and
Fulton Houses. Another $450,000 was allocated to renovate Hell’s Kitchen Park and
$150,000 was allocated to PS 111 for new closets and shelving in classrooms.
 The Speaker’s efforts to mitigate food insecurity are continuing. In that regard, the
office is grateful for the work of Aleta LaFargue and Guy Crowl at Manhattan Plaza
for their help in distributing food bags to tenants. The Speaker also appreciates the
efforts of Chair Lowell Kern in getting a large donation from the Hudson
Yards/Hell’s Kitchen BID for food purchased at Trader Joe’s that was distributed at
public housing developments and to others in the community.
 Mr. Bottcher acknowledged the issue of homelessness is the most difficult issue that
the office has had to address. It has laid bare the issue of mental health in the
homeless population. Libraries and subways have been closed during the pandemic,
driving the street-homeless population out into the community for everyone to see
their numbers and their problems. Then there is the decreasing population of Riker’s
Island that has put more homeless individuals on the streets. Riker’s has, for years,
provided de-facto housing for those with mental illness. Another aspect of the
pandemic that has made the homeless more visible is the shift of panhandling
locations away from parts of the City that were normally heavily populated with
tourists but are now shut down. Panhandlers are now approaching people in other
locations where they are likely to find larger groups of people, such as outdoor
dining restaurants. The Speaker’s office has been working with restaurant owners on
Restaurant Row to help deal with this problem.
 While it is necessary and appropriate to move people out of congregate homeless
shelters into the thousands of available hotel rooms throughout the City, hotel
shelters have to be sited properly and run competently. But because many of theexisting hotel shelters in the district do not meet this standard, the office has been
working with many of the people in attendance at the meeting, DHS, and others to
get a handle on the operators who are not doing a good job. And, although several
operators have been performing well, others are not. Much of the problem comes
from the fact that many in the shelter hotels have been inappropriately housed. So,
the Speaker’s objective is to get these operators in line and de-densifying the
shelters in neighborhoods where too many have been placed on one block. This
issue has been occupying the majority of the office staff’s time lately.
Haley Berson for Ms. Berson reviewed a couple of the Congressmember’s recent activities:
Congressmember  Today he spoke on the House floor regarding the No Ban Act which seeks to undo
Jerrold Nadler some of the harmful implications of the Trump Administration’s Muslim ban which
prevented refugees, visa holders, and legal permanent residents from entering the
country. It even denied them a right to counsel while being detained at American
airports.
 Mr. Nadler was a leader in getting the House to pass the George Floyd Justice in
Policing Act, one of the most wide-sweeping pieces of police reform legislation
ever to be enacted into law. It effectively bans violent policing practices and
institutes systems of accountability, such as banning chokeholds and no-knock
warrants, reforming qualified immunity, and ensuring that violent police officers
cannot simply move to another jurisdiction after being fired for bad behavior.
Luke Wolf for Mr. Wolf provided updates on the Comptroller’s activities and noted an upcoming event:
Comptroller  There will be a virtual Town Hall on Monday, July 27th at 6:30 pm with Senator
Scott Stringer Brad Hoylman, Assemblymember Linda Rosenthal, and Council Member Carlina
Rivera.
 The office analyzed the federal Payroll Protection Program and how it was rolled
out in the City. They found that, if NYC were a state, it would rank 49th out of 50
states in terms of the number of businesses that were able to access funds through
the program. In Manhattan, only 52% of employee-based businesses received a PPP
loan.
 The Comptroller sent a letter to the Mayor and DOE Chancellor regarding plans for
reopening schools in the Fall in which he raised four concerns: 1) expanding child
care access for families; 2) making sure there clear methods of communication of
expectations regarding remote learning with a focus on having live synchronous
instruction; 3) what is the plan to increase staffing to ensure that the reopening plan
is even possible, and 4) clear guidance on health care and access to nurses for
schools and the school community.
Board Reports & Business
Adoption of Agenda and The Agenda, as amended, and the June minutes were unanimously approved.
Minutes
District Manager Report Highlights of events the District Manager or Staff attended on behalf of the Board
and upcoming events:
 District Manager reconvened the Hudson Yard Construction Task Force
with the support of the Mayor’s Community Affairs Unit and Speaker
Johnson’s office.
 District Manager was a guest presenter for a remote learning class for
Avenues School.
 The district office has been responding to a high number of complaints
regarding the increase in temporary shelters and continues to advocate forthe Dept. of Homeless Services to lead monthly meetings with all providers
and community stakeholders.
 The district office is also receiving a high number of complaints about
homeless encampments and is working with the Dept. of Homeless
Services and other stakeholders such as the Port Authority to resolve some
of these encampments.
 Regarding our new office space, we continue to work remotely, but our
office equipment and files have been moved to a new district office. We are
still working out the finer details of the licensing agreement with the
landlord.
August Committee Updates and Board Reminders:
 To date, only the Business License and Permits Committee will be meeting
on Tuesday, August 11th at 6:30 pm.
The Chair introduced the newest member of the Board, Kerry Keenan, and then
Board Chair Report went on to review his activities during the past month:
 The executive committee members have attended and will continue to
attend, meetings with our elected representatives and the Department of
Homeless Services regarding all of the temporary hotel shelters in our
district, including those on West 36th, West 37th, West 42nd, West 47th,
West 51st Streets, and the Aladdin Hotel. The work is ongoing, and letters
are coming out of two committees on that.
 The NYPD announced on the spur of the moment that it would be holding
community meetings following the protests over the killing of George
Floyd. I wish to thank Christine Berthet, Deloris Rubin, Katy Stokes, and
Viren Brahmbhatt for attending four precinct meetings on such short notice.
 As we announced back in June, we formed a social justice working group
and it has met every Tuesday in June and July. The working group drafted a
letter to the Mayor and a set of recommendations that will be covered later
in the business session. Katy and Viren did a fine job co-chairing the group
and coming up with recommendations that we are going to pursue going
forward, one of which is keeping the group intact to address public safety
issues in the community.
 The other group we announced in June was the balanced business task force
chaired by Burt Lazarin. It is holding a small business forum on reopening
the City on the 28th at 6:30 pm – the registration link is on the CB4
website.
 The Port Authority Working Group got an update with elected officials and
we are looking to have the Port Authority return to the Board in September
to present on their current plan.
 The Chelsea Land Use Committee held a joint meeting with the
Transportation Planning Committee and provided public testimony on the
Empire Station EIS for which there is a letter in the business session of this
meeting.
 Chelsea Land Use is continuing its meetings with the Terminal Storage and
the Starrett-Lehigh Buildings regarding the possible expansion of the
Special West Chelsea District.
 There is finally some good news to report on getting the tow pound moved
off of Pier 76. There are two facilities there: the tow pound itself and an
NYPD repair shop. We have been authorized to announce that the repair
shop will be moved by the end of the year to a former car dealership on
11th Avenue.Motions, Amendments, &

September 2020 Full Board Meeting Minutes
Presentation: 10th Precinct Commanding Officer Inspector Kevin Coleman
PRESENTATIONS /
Inspector Coleman indicated that in the 10th Precinct, which covers Chelsea and
PUBLIC HEARINGS
Hell’s Kitchen, the crime index is down 9.3% this year, probably as a result of the
pandemic keeping people off the streets. He noted, however, that the principal drivers
of crime in the precinct – burglary and auto theft – have increased. Package theft in
residential buildings is of particular concern and he advised residents to have
caretakers look after their packages and to be sure to keep packages out of the line of
sight of anyone who might peer into their building. He also advised against leaving
keys in your car and keeping the engine running while briefly stepping away. The
Inspector touched on several other topics:
• Homelessness is a major concern in the district, as well as the rest of the City
with the rise of homeless people out on the streets due to COVID and the
temporary shelters in hotels. One such hotel that housed 101 people on West
42nd Street was recently evacuated due to a water main break and the
residents were sent back to Brooklyn.
• The Hell’s Kitchen Action Committee was formed by a group in the southern
part of the neighborhood about ten weeks ago. Its purpose is to address crime
by working hand-in-hand with the NYPD. They requested the implementation
of a policy they called “8-for-8” that puts 8 officers at foot posts in a small
area for 8 weeks to create a visible police presence for a predictable amount of
time. Although the plan could not be implemented as fully as desired, more
officers have been deployed in the area between 41st and 43rd Streets from
9th Avenue to 11th Avenue. This has been going on for seven weeks and the
feedback has been positive with fewer quality-of-life issues being reported.
• In the past, DHS has been mainly responsible for homelessness issues in
coordination with the precincts, but that has changed over the Summer. Now,
DHS is more accountable and has to deal with problems such as encampments
themselves. The precinct now alerts DHS when it encounters a problem.
• As to neighborhood policing in general, the Inspector acknowledged that after
the George Floyd shooting, people are upset with the police for legitimate
reasons. He stated that the goal of the department was to carry on with the
philosophy of neighborhood policing put in place five years ago by
Commissioner Bratton. That means having a good relationship with the public
and building rapport with the public so that we can work together.
Cooperation is what allows the department to do its job efficiently and
effectively. The department must be viewed as legitimate for the public to
have trust in the police. Otherwise, victims of crimes and witnesses would notcooperate and those in possession of evidence would not turn it over. Public
safety is a shared responsibility.
• The events that occurred over the Summer, including the looting during
protest marches and demonstrations, were a major setback for the NYPD
because it has made great strides over the past few years. In fact, crime was at
a historic low for the City in 2017 for the previous 50 years. A second historic
low came in 2018, beating the previous year’s numbers. Even with recent
increases in shootings and homicides in the City, the Inspector believes we
will get through it. He hopes to rebuild the precinct’s relationship with the
community and expand upon it with more community outreach.
Presentation: NYC Comptroller’s Office on the Status of the City’s Budget
Preston Niblack, the Deputy Comptroller for Budget, gave a slideshow presentation
to provide an overview of the adopted FY 2021 Budget. Much of the slideshow can be
viewed at https://comptroller.nyc.gov/reports/comptrollers-fy-2021-preliminary-
budget-presentation/
Mr. Niblack offered the following highlights:
• Over the last several months, there has been an unprecedented economic crash
both nationally and locally. In the pre-pandemic month of February, there
were 4.1 million jobs in the City. By April, there were only 3.2 million – a loss
of roughly 900,000 jobs in the space of a month. The unemployment rate, at a
historic low of 3.4% in February, went up steadily to 15%, 18%, and 20% in
June.
• The City recovered about 25% of its lost jobs in July, lagging the national
recovery rate of 45%. This probably has to do with the composition of jobs in
the City being oriented toward retail, tourism, hospitality, and restaurants
where the absence of indoor dining is a factor.
• The pandemic caused the Mayor to have to mark down the revenue projections
contained in his January preliminary budget twice so that revenue projections
at the end of May for this year were reduced by $7.1 billion. This resulted in a
“gap” of $8.3 billion between revenue and expenses.
• About a third of the gap was closed in the FY 2021 Budget by drawing down
budgeted reserves. Another third came from implementing the Citywide
Savings Program, the details of which can be found at
https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/omb/downloads/pdf/csp6-20.pdf . The remaining
third came from a combination of federal aid grants, labor savings, and a
surplus that was carried over from the FY 2020 Budget.
• The City ended up adopting an $88 billion fiscal year 2021 Budget, which is
down about $9.5 billion from the previous budget. Right now, the City is
projecting that revenues will rebound in fiscal year 2022 and going forward.
But spending is still projected well above projected revenues with gaps at
manageable levels of $4 billion next year and $3 billion after that.
• Mr. Niblack went on to answer some specific questions that were submitted to
him before his presentation. They covered matters relating to affordable
housing, the NYPD budget, neighborhood services, transportation safety, and
City employee layoffs. In response to a question from the Chair during the
meeting regarding possible layoffs of community board employees, he stated
that he was unaware of a requirement to do so. His answers can be viewed on
our YouTube page here .
• Mr. Niblack also entertained questions from members during the meeting that
were focused on the DOE budget, school building safety regarding COVID,
funding of school construction and reconstruction projects, and more.Public Session
Derrick Ingram Mr. Ingram, a resident of West 45th Street in Hell’s Kitchen, spoke at the invitation of the
Board following media reports of his harrowing experience with the NYPD in August,
during which his apartment building was descended on by police squads attempting to
arrest him on a warrant that apparently never existed. Mr. Ingram recounted in detail the
events that took place that day and told of the emotional scars that he has been left with. He
asked the Board to write a letter to Council Speaker Johnson and request an investigation.
A letter to Speaker Johnson is the subject of Agenda Item 6. A letter to NYPD
Commissioner Shea regarding the use of facial recognition software is the subject of
Agenda Item 7.
Michael Glaser Mr. Glaser is a small business owner and condo board president of the Chelsea Grand,
located at West 17th Street and 8th Avenue. His children attend Corlears School on West
15th Street between 8th and 9th Avenues. It is a small private elementary school that will
begin in-person classes in a couple of weeks. He stated that the parents are desperate to
keep the school open and operational and that that is contingent upon them getting some
street space for the children. He further stated that the Mayor is working with public
schools on street access, but he is unsure whether the school’s application to DOT will be
successful. He noted that he was at the meeting for informational purposes because the
parents might need the Board’s help in the future.
Shaun Ruskin Mr. Ruskin announced the availability of apartments in the assisted living residence known
as Village Care at 46 & 10, which is located at the corner of West 46th Street and 10th
Avenue. Units are available for both private pay and Medicaid eligible recipients over 62
years of age.
Brian Weber Mr. Weber is a resident of West 36th Street and a Public Member of Clinton/Hell’s Kitchen
Land Use Committee. He has spoken many times as a public speaker at Board meetings
about the temporary shelter situation on West 36th and 37th Streets. He stated that there has
been no progress by DHS in fixing the problems at the three shelters they established in the
neighborhood: 3 separate hotels, run by 3 separate providers for 820 residents. This
concentration represents 6% of all shelter residents who have been moved into temporary
hotels throughout the City and it is a density that is far too great for the neighborhood. He
asked the Board’s help in getting Speaker Johnson to advocate for removing at least one of
the hotels out of the neighborhood.
Lisa Wager Ms. Wager is the Director of the Office of Government Relations at the Fashion Institute of
Technology. She made the following announcements:
• As you know, educational institutions around the country are grappling with
starting the new Fall semester. We are doing the same thing. Our Restart Fall 2020
Plan incorporates significant health and safety protocols. And of course, SUNY
campuses are going to be responsive to whatever changes happen in the
environment. Here is what FIT is doing: Classes begin on Monday and they are
continuing through Wednesday, December 23rd. All classes, except for a couple of
graduate-level courses, are being conducted remotely. Students will have limited
access to lesson studios with the supervision of trained personnel through a
reservation system and following health and safety protocols for social distancing,
et cetera.
• As of November 24th, all classes and coursework will be fully remote. There will
be no students living on West 27th Street in residence halls this semester. Kaufman
Hall, which is in CB4 on 31st Street has a limited number of students. The dining
hall at the Dubinsky Center on 8th Avenue is open for those students to get take-
out food since there is no indoor dining.• We're maintaining a full complement of public safety officers on the campus and
the building and ground staff is continuing to maintain and oversee the campus
environment, so it is safe and pretty. The Fall Restart Plan is on the FIT website,
where you can also see our Fall public programming.
• Three students from our Fashion Design class that graduated in the Spring
redesigned the Girl Scouts uniform and apparel line and it is super cool. There are
18 interchangeable pieces for girls grades three through six. It got lots of media
coverage.
• One of our graduates illustrated LeBron James’s New York Times bestselling
children's book. She is an Illustration alumna from the class of 2008. She grew up
in Queens and says she just basically drew her childhood for this book.
Sandra Ms. Hollingsworth is a registered nurse who works at Village Care at 46 & 10. She added
Hollinsworth to Mr. Ruskin’s statements by noting that the facility is the most affordable of its kind in
the City. She provided her contact number for anyone interested in visiting the facility:
(646) 634-3102. One may also call the facility directly to request a virtual tour at (212)
977-4600.
Pamela Wolf Ms. Wolf had a question for Inspector Coleman regarding additional officers to patrol the
area around the LinkNYC kiosks and sidewalk shed located on Eighth Avenue between
21st and 22nd Streets. She stated that they continue to be an attractive nuisance for the
homeless and drug dealers.
Remarks from Elected Officials and Representatives
Borough Ms. Brewer provided the following updates:
President Gale • She stated that she is continuing her work on a letter with CB4 and other community
Brewer boards regarding problems at temporary hotel shelters, but that a longer discussion
is still needed to resolve them.
• She did a small business call along with CB4 and community members to hand out
the usual PPE supplies and continued to hear the same complaints regarding rent.
But the main complaint is the lack of indoor dining. She is on the Governor’s task
force on reopening and expects the Mayor to make an announcement soon.
• The City got funding from the Governor to help pay for enumerators to go door-to-
door to complete the 2020 Census. Her office sent out 280,000 postcards to people
living in traditionally low-reporting Census tracts. The office also got a list from the
Board of Elections naming people who have moved out of the City temporarily. The
list revealed 35,000 such individuals and her office will now send them a letter to
remind them to complete the Census as City residents even though they are away
temporarily.
• Reopening schools is an ongoing issue, even though a new date has been set for
September 21. Another issue that remains unsettled is that of an executive
superintendent. There is also the issue of having enough laptops available when
schools reopen because the DOE has only 20,000 left. Opinions differ among
schools as to which ones want outdoor learning due to concerns about street noise.
• Ms. Brewer mentioned the letter that she sent to the NYPD regarding barriers. She
acknowledged that some precincts should have them, but the streets should not be
closed because of them.
• The office released a report recently about store vacancies along Broadway and is
awaiting data to determine exactly how many vacancies currently exist.
• Ms. Brewer invited everyone to go visit the new women’s monument in Central
Park because it represents seven years of hard work on her part.• Ms. Brewer thanked the City for establishing MEND NYC, a program to provide
mediation to New Yorkers and hospitality businesses across the City who are in
disputes over quality-of-life issues.
Betsy Schmid for Ms. Schmid gave updates on some of the Congresswoman’s recent activities:
Congresswoman • Much of her time has been spent on saving the Post Office. On August 22, the
Carolyn Maloney House passed her Delivering for America Act, which puts the Post Office back to
the level it was at in January of 2020. She also introduced the Nonpartisan
Postmaster General Act in response to the Trump Administration’s Politicization of
the Postal Service. She sent Postmaster DeJoy a subpoena today asking for
documents that he has refused to deliver. Overall, her work is aimed at making sure
the Post Office is functioning well during the election and that people can rely on it
to get their medications.
• She attended a press conference today on the Lower East Side with other elected
officials to stress the importance of filling out the 2020 Census.
Senator Brad The Senator stated that he enjoyed listening to the public speakers before speaking
Hoylman himself, and he noted that he and his staff member, Maia Berlow, were moved by the
testimony of Derrick Ingram. He mentioned that he and Ms. Berlow had spoken to Mr.
Ingram after his incident to discuss the excessive force that was used by police officers
without a warrant. He further stated that his review of the ACLU’s guidelines on how to act
in such cases was followed precisely by Mr. Ingram at the time of the police action. He
commended him for that.
Mr. Hoylman sent a letter to the Police Commissioner asking for a full accounting of the
events in Mr. Ingram’s case, including the costs of the operation, the process of approval,
names of involved officers, and the use of facial recognition technology. The Senator, with
Ms. Berlow’s help, wrote a bill that would ban the use of facial recognition software by the
police until a task force was set up to determine where the data goes and how it’s used.
The Senator held a press conference at the Farley Post Office with other elected officials
about the need for ballot drop boxes in the State of New York. Thirty-three states and the
District of Columbia have an alternative to voting by mail through the Post Office or going
to a poll site and dropping off a ballot. As Gale Brewer said at the press conference: It’s a
low-tech solution to a complex problem.
Mr. Hoylman gave a big shoutout to CB4’s Leslie Murphy and Josephine Ishmon for the
project that they created to get student teachers from local colleges and universities to
provide live distant learning for school children in the City. It promises to be a huge asset
when remote learning starts up again this month.
The Senator has been getting a lot of calls from tenants at Grand Central Station about rent
that they owe to the MTA. He believes that the MTA should institute a better negotiating
policy with its tenants about overdue rent because Grand Central Station can be viewed as
the front door to the City and the small businesses that operate there should be given a break
of some kind to remain open. Landlords across the City are acting much like the MTA in not
negotiating fairly.
Finally, The Senator reminded everyone about the mammogram van that is coming to the
district, and also to request a mail-in ballot and to fill in the Census.
Councilmember Ms. Rosenthal gave five quick updates:
Helen Rosenthal • She believes that things are finally settling down on the Upper West Side regarding
the temporary hotel shelters. As to the three shelters in her district, she thinks the
NYPD and the shelter providers are doing a great job. The clients are getting good
services. One client told her that he was able to recover faster and that he has more
quiet time to study for his GED exam.• The Council was able to get fairly adequate funding for social service providers in
last year’s budget. And, although the City promised to keep funding at the same
level in the latest budget, it failed to do so. She and other Council Members feel that
they were deliberately misled by the City and, thus, prevented from requesting
appropriate funding. This was one of the reasons for her voting against the budget.
She and others are continuing to seek re-funding certain budget items. She is a
strong supporter of borrowing and believes the State should authorize it.
• She will be sending out an email to parents who have said they can afford to live
without their pandemic EBT card, known as a P-EBT card that was sent out to
families regardless of income status. The email will direct these parents to the
website https://www.sharemypebt.com/ where they can find ways to donate the
value of this food benefit rather than try to give away the card itself.
• Two votes are coming up in the City Council that Ms. Rosenthal welcomes
community input on: tweaking the chokehold bill and, the decision on Industry City.
She is leaning toward voting “No” on both proposals but is looking for feedback on
why she should vote “Yes.”
• Her office has been working remotely and has been helping families get food
through the GetFood NYC program and find ways to deal with their rent issues. She
is encouraging people to fill in their Census forms and asking that everyone call
three of their friends to remind them as well.
Emily Bartosek Ms. Bartosek gave the following updates:
for • The Assembly Member’s office has been getting calls on all of the same issues that
Assemblymember were touched upon by the previous speakers. Constituents have reached out about
Linda Rosenthal school reopening, getting access to food, and hundreds of unemployment cases that
are unresolved with people not receiving their benefits. Hundreds of parents and
grandparents have called about the Department of Parks and Recreation
announcement that it would not be issuing permits for youth activities for the Fall.
Ms. Rosenthal wrote a letter to Commissioner Silver about it and he reversed his
decision. Permits will be issued beginning in mid-Fall for youth athletic teams such
as soccer, baseball, and other minimal-contact sports.
• Ms. Rosenthal will hold a Census phone bank event on Monday, September 14 in
the afternoon. Invitations will be sent by email with more information.
• There will be a virtual blood drive this month with the New York Blood Center,
whose blood supplies are down 75% due to office closures and the suspension of
mobile drive events. Ms. Rosenthal is asking donors to go online to find the center
nearest to them even if they happen to be quarantining in a different part of the state.
• There will be an event with the Food Bank for New York on September 24 at
Lincoln Center where people can receive free pantry boxes of food. Ms. Rosenthal
will be on hand to give out PPE supplies, gloves, and hand sanitizer.
Board Reports & Business

agencies such as DDC. If you see any, please contact the district office and
we can work on resolving them.
• MCB4 and HCC will host a second Tenants Rights Information Session on
Tuesday, September 15th at 6:00 pm. Registration can be found on our

nominating committee. Other committee members are Christine Berthet,
Viren Brahmbhatt, Elzora Cleveland, Sabrina Reveron, Hector Vazquez,
and Rob Walker. Anyone wishing to run for office should email Jesse
Bodine within the next two weeks. The current slate of officers is not
restricted from running and it looks as though they will.
• It’s almost budget time and the Statement of District Needs kicks off again.
Jessica Chait, who is the 2nd Vice Chair, will chair the Budget Task Force.
We are looking at ways to streamline the process and committee chairs will
probably receive advice before their next committee meetings.
• One of the small meetings that took place during August when most of the
Board was on vacation was the Health and Human Services Committee that
stayed on top of the homeless shelter issue in Hell’s Kitchen. We are
continuing to work with Gale Brewer’s office and Corey Johnson’s office
to get the Department of Homeless Services to limit what is going on with
the temporary shelters on West 36th Street.
• J.D. Noland and the Clinton/Hell’s Kitchen Land Use Committee are
continuing to work on the ULURP for Slaughterhouse and some other sites.
• The Transportation Planning Committee and the Chelsea Land Use
Committee had meetings with CB5 and the Regional Plan Association
regarding the Empire Station Complex.
• The Port Authority Working Group continues to work with Port Authority
on a new design for the Bus Terminal.• The ACES Committee has been doing valuable work as evidenced by the
new business letters that will be taken up in the Business Session. A special
shoutout goes out to Leslie Murphy and Josephine Ishmon for their efforts.
• Leslie Murphy has taken over for Maria Ortiz as Co-Secretary because
Maria had to step down because of new work obligations. Patty Carnevale
had to resign from the Board because of professional obligations.

District Manager
October 2020 Full Board Meeting Minutes
Presentation: Deputy Inspector Steven M. Hellman 13th Precinct
PRESENTATIONS /
Inspector Hellman began by noting that crimes in the precinct were down 11% for
PUBLIC HEARINGS
the year, with only 167 crimes reported. Compared to 2018, the reduction is 20%.
Crimes were down in every category except vehicle theft where there were 9 this year
compared to 7 last year. Quality-of-life type crimes are a continuing issue with low-
level random assaults being an example. There were 21 such assaults this year and
they were committed mostly by homeless individuals who have a greater presence than
in earlier periods. He has been working with the Department of Homeless Services to
address this problem.
Inspector Hellman went on to answer questions, including one about how calls of
shots fired are treated and another about how he deals with crimes committed on the
border of a contiguous precinct. He also noted that COVID has had a great impact on
his precinct with 65% of his officers being infected at the same time. In answer to a
question, he explained the policy regarding the wearing of masks by officers on the
street. He stated that officers are required to wear masks where social distancing is not
possible and that there is a disciplinary process in place for officers who do not
comply. Regarding a question about the jurisdiction of the NYPD over the homeless,
he stated that every 911 or 311 call into the precinct is responded to. What that means
is that if the responding officers observe a crime such as drug use, for example, an
arrest will be made. If a responding officer comes upon a homeless encampment, then,
unlike in the past, no enforcement action will be taken, and the Department of
Homeless Services will be called to deal with it. In answer to a final question
regarding measures that the NYPD will be taking to ensure safety at polling sites, the
Inspector stated that there have been numerous planning meetings in the NYPD and
that patrols would be enhanced during the election. Every officer in the city will be on
12-hour tours during the election.
Public Session
Ryan Brodsky Mr. Brodsky complained about Astro’s Dog Run being closed for a month and a half or
two months and his inability to obtain information about it. The District Manager advised
Mr. Brodsky during the meeting that the Board staff would continue to work with him to
get the situation straightened out.
Aimee Todoroff Ms. Todoroff spoke about two bills coming before the City Council on October 15. The
bills, Intro 2068 and Intro 2034 would work in tandem to create a streamlined way for arts
and cultural groups to activate outdoor public spaces in much the same way restaurantsaccess Open Streets. The legislation will create an interactive map that lets New Yorkers
see what is happening in their community. She asked the Board to write a letter to Speaker
Johnson voicing support for the bills.
Guy Yedwab Mr. Yedwab requested CB4 support for the same Open Culture legislation as the previous
speaker. He stressed the needs of small cultural institutions like dance and theatre venues
that are unable to operate while still being on the hook for rent every month. He noted that
CB4 covers the densest area in terms of cultural institutions and venues so providing for
outdoor public performances is a way for these institutions to survive. He thanked Senator
Robert Jackson, who was present at the meeting, for support of rent relief bills that are now
in Albany.
Nancy Sliwa Ms. Sliwa spoke on behalf of her husband Curtis and the Guardian Angels organization that
he founded in 1979 as an unarmed volunteer group to provide community patrols
throughout the city. The organization is comprised of men and women who operate in 13
countries and 39 cities around the world. They have offered their services to various
communities in the city during the coronavirus lockdown because of an increase in crime
and quality-of-life issues. Several members of the Guardian Angels live in Chelsea and
want to offer their help to the community there, in particular concerning the corridor on 8th
Avenue between 20th and 22nd Streets where drug-dealing and open drug use are on the
rise. Anyone who wishes to engage with the organization can do so at their meetings on
Thursdays at 7:30 pm and Saturdays at 1:00 pm on Eighth Avenue and 14th Street.
Brian Weber Mr. Weber is a resident of West 36th Street in Hell’s Kitchen and a public member of CB4.
He is also the interim co-chair of the newly-formed 36th Street Block Association and, as
such, he spoke in support of the letter that is the subject of Agenda Item 12, which is a
letter out of the HH&HS Committee addressing the hotel shelters in the West 30s. He
called for reducing the number of temporary shelters sited in the hotels on West 36th and
37th Streets by relocating at least one or more of the shelters. He mentioned his previous
four appearances at CB4 meetings and lamented the lack of progress in resolving the
problems facing the residents in the neighborhood.
Allen Marc Mr. Marc is another resident of the West 30s seeking support in addressing the safety
issues affecting the children and seniors in his neighborhood. He complained of getting no
help from the Mayor’s office in dealing with the over-population of homeless shelters
whose residents now out-number existing residents. He complained of his inability to find a
realtor who will list his apartment because they claim it is impossible to sell an apartment
in the neighborhood due to the current density of shelters.
Randy Barksdale Mr. Barksdale, who has lived on West 36th Street for 22 years, stated that he has never
seen conditions deteriorate as he has recently. He asked for the Board’s support because he
has had none from public officials.
Alexander Mr. Mattielli is also a resident of West 36th Street who reiterated the sentiments expressed
Mattielli by the previous speakers. He complained of getting no help from city officials and pointed
to his experience of seeing people arrested and released from the precinct just a few hours
later.
Lisa Wager Ms. Wager is the Director of the Office of Government Relations at the Fashion Institute of
Technology. She is a regular speaker at CB4 meetings, and this month made the following
announcements:
• Genesis Jerez, a 2016 BFA graduate of FIT, began her term on October 1 as one of
four Artists-in-Residents at The Studio Museum in Harlem. This 11-month
program awards a $20,000 stipend and the artist’s work is exhibited at the museum
during their term.
• Several FIT alumni designed the dresses worn by Beyonce in Black is King the
feature-length visual album inspired by The Lion King.• The Center for Continuing Professional Studies is offering pre-college courses for
high school and middle school students as well as credit, non-credit, and certificate
programs for adults.
Remarks from Elected Officials and Representatives
Senator Robert Senator Jackson gave the following updates:
Jackson • He and his staff have met virtually through Zoom with the residents of West 36th
Street and the Commander of Midtown South to bring about a resolution of the
safety and security issues in the area.
• The Senator has been meeting with other Manhattan democrats, the majority leader
in Albany, and Senator Chuck Schumer about the status of the city budget. Nothing
is certain until the federal COVID relief package is approved in Congress.
• Mr. Jackson has been involved in the discussions surrounding the Mayor’s intention
to borrow money to fill budget gaps and prevent the devastation that would come
from more budget cuts.
• Mr. Jackson referred to his monthly newsletter for more information on recent
legislation.

2020_newsletter.pdf
Assemblymember Mr. Gottfried offered the following comments:
Dick Gottfried • Regarding the homeless in the district, we have welcomed a lot of programs for
homeless people and those with needy conditions. And what we always find is that
what is needed is a strong program of services and security. Wherever we get that in
place, through either the city or the provider, things work out a whole lot better. We
have not seen that with the homeless in the hotels.
• Mr. Gottfried stressed the importance of voting in person – whether during early
voting or on election day – to the extent one is able, notwithstanding the availability
of mail-in ballots. The reason for that is because absentee votes will not show up in
the count until a week or two after election day. It is going to be very important to
the security of our country and the security of the election that the votes in Hell’s
Kitchen and Chelsea show up in the national totals on TV on election night.
Otherwise, massive disruption in the counting of ballots will follow.
• There is no way we are going to get enough help from Washington to dig ourselves
out of the coronavirus hole. Or, to dig us out of the austerity budget hole that we
have been digging deeper and deeper into even before the coronavirus has evolved.
To do that, New York needs to enact a strong package of increased taxes on ultra-
high wealth. Unless we increase the taxes on really ultra-high wealth, we are not
going to be able to fund healthcare, education, housing, transportation, and a host of
other needs.
Assemblymember Ms. Rosenthal gave these updates:
Linda Rosenthal • She carried a bill about the “pink tax,” which is the practice of charging “pink
products” or products targeted for women more than the same products that are
targeted at men, which has been a long-standing practice. It was included in the
budget and now gender-based discrimination in products and services will no longer
be allowed. So, the pink razor should cost as much as the blue one. The same thing
goes for the cost of dry cleaning.
• There was a recent ruling by Judge Arthur Engoron in which he declared
mechanical voids in buildings to be in violation of zoning laws. As a result, he
stopped construction on a building and prohibited the developer from placing
mechanical equipment on lower floors to increase valuable building heights withoutadding to total FAR. Ms. Rosenthal and Senator Jackson have each proposed bills
that would outlaw this practice.
• Ms. Rosenthal wrote a letter in support of the WPE Committee letter to the
Department of Parks – Agenda Item 7 – regarding the refurbishing and maintenance
of the dog run in DeWitt Clinton Park.
• Flu shots will be available on October 20 from 10 am to 3 pm at the Lincoln Square
Neighborhood Center at West 65th Street for those who call or email the office for
an appointment.
• There will be a Rat Academy event on November 17 with various block
associations. Anyone interested in attending should call or email the office.
Borough Ms. Brewer provided the following updates:
President Gale • Ms. Brewer reviewed the ongoing work dealing with the shelters in the district,
Brewer including her letter to HRA Commissioner Banks, who has promised to get DHS
staff to address the issues that have been raised.
• She mentioned the NYCHA Chelsea Working Group, noting that it was good to
have it up and running again because its work will influence all future discussions
about RAD conversions in the Borough of Manhattan.
• She visited the 10th, 13th, and 17th police precincts to greet their new commanding
officers and to observe activity in the area.
• She encouraged everyone to visit Pier 26 in Hudson River Park, describing it as
“phenomenal.” She noted that one of her three appointees to the Trust, Douglas
Durst, had resigned and she replaced him with Chair Kern as the representative of
the CB4 area.
• Ms. Brewer thanked the Board for working with Brian Lewis of her office on
getting the LinkNYC kiosks along Eighth Avenue removed or relocated. They are
working with DoITT to negotiate with the vendor of the kiosks.
• Her office put out a list of the 100 public restrooms that remain open in Manhattan,
not just for the homeless, but for the everyday New Yorker.
• The office has been using its list of 35,000 residents who moved out of the city
temporarily due to COVID to track them down and get them to fill out the census. It
has also made headway with management at the larger apartment buildings to
receive demographic information on residents who cannot be contacted.
• There have been ongoing issues with getting digital devices to school children in a
timely fashion. And, although the city has them, Ms. Brewer has just recently gotten
permission to spend the money in the 2020 budget to acquire them.
Congressmember Congressman Nadler contributed the following comments:
Jerrold Nadler • The House last week past an updated Heroes Act, which is a modified bill from the
legislation we passed back in May. The legislation once again provides economic
relief for American families by providing stimulus checks, restoring and expanding
the weekly $600 federal unemployment payments through next January, bolstering
housing assistance through direct rent relief, and increasing food stamp benefits by
15%. It supports small businesses by improving the paycheck protection program,
provides the hardest hit small businesses, nonprofits, and entrepreneurs with second
loans, and provides state and local governments with the funding they need to help
weather the pandemic. New York State itself will receive $21 billion and New York
City about $9 billion. It provides essential support for transit infrastructure and
contains substantial assistance for the MTA, which will allow the MTA to continue
operations into next year. It fully funds the Postal Service and provides states with
new resources to safeguard the integrity and security of our elections and ensuring
the integrity of the 2020 census.
• The package contains two pieces of legislation that Mr. Nadler sponsored: The
Restaurants Act and the Save Our Stages Act. It will provide New York Cityadditional targeted assistance for independent restaurants and live entertainment
venues and theaters.
• The House Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee released the findings of its
more than 16-month long investigation into the state of the digital economy,
especially amongst dominating companies like Apple, Amazon, Google, and
Facebook. The findings show the necessity of Congress to take action restoring
competition and amending the antitrust laws.
Carl Wilson for Mr. Wilson gave his monthly update for the Speaker’s office:
Council Speaker • A large bulk of the time spent in CD4 during the past month has been working with
Corey Johnson several of the shelter providers that are in our district. We have been working very
closely with our partners in government, which include the other local elected
officials in CD4. We had a series of meetings with shelter providers and DHS
concerning the shelters in our district.
• We recently met with the shelter operators on 36th Street to discuss their operations
and some of the complaints we've seen. We understand that each of the shelters
there is adding two full-time security members who will focus exclusively on the
outside of the shelter. They are expected to begin before the end of the month.
• One of the problems we identified in the small-budget hotel shelters is the lack of
programming space. So, we got in touch with Metro Baptist Church to find some
programming space for a couple of providers. Things there look promising and we
have scheduled a walkthrough for next week.
• We have also been in touch with some of the general contractors about scaffolding
that has been in place for an extended period on jobs that they are working on,
specifically, 315 and 327 7th Avenue where we have been assured that the
scaffolding would be down by the end of the month.
• We have advised ACE, the supplemental cleaning service operating on West 36th
Street that we provide funding for service on that block for four days a week, which
they do from 8 am to 4 pm.
• We have worked with the shelter provider at the Skyline Hotel to resolve problems
relating to programming space and security. Residents have indicated that
conditions have improved.
• In September, we had a community cleanup day in partnership with our block
associations and CB4. Also, new silver trash cans have been placed on every corner
along 9th Avenue between 42nd and 57th Streets to replace the old wire baskets that
were there.
Luke Wolf for Mr. Wolf provided the following updates:
Comptroller • The Comptroller launched his “Save Main Street” initiative in August as a crash
Scott Stringer relief program to help businesses reopen, stay open, and revive high-vacancy
corridors that have been devastated by the pandemic. His report can be found here:
https://comptroller.nyc.gov/reports/save-main-street/
• The office has put together a back-to-school guide to help parents and teachers as
they prepare to head back to school. https://comptroller.nyc.gov/newsroom/2020-
21-back-to-school-guide/
• The Comptroller has called upon the city to make public schools more inclusive for
non-binary and gender non-conforming students. Right now, students do not have
the option to self-identify as they would like on the city's online teaching platforms
• The Comptroller’s office was able to return over $2 million in stolen prevailing
wages over the course of the pandemic to workers across the city. We will continue
to do that work.Board Reports & Business
Adoption of Agenda and The Agenda and the September minutes, as amended, were unanimously approved.
Minutes
Nominating Committee Paul Devlin, Chair of the Nominating Committee, stated that the current board
officers have expressed their interest to run for office again. Others may come
forward as well.
Interviews of nominees will be held in the coming weeks and the Committee will
present a slate of recommended nominees at the November general meeting.
Budget Task Force Jessica Chait, 2nd Vice Chair and Chair of the Budget Task Force, gave a status
report. She stated that the task force was in the process of gathering feedback, not
only from our committees but also from the community about what our priorities
should be in terms of advocating for the 2022 budget. She encouraged the members
to show up to their committees in these next few weeks and to go through the
process of looking at what we put together previously and thinking of new topics
that may have come to light as a result of COVID and what it has done to our city.
Ms. Chait noted that the task force created a new survey for the community to use
in providing input and that there have already been 120 responses. There is a link to
the survey on the homepage of the CB4 website. She asked that all responses be
submitted by the 16th.
District Manager Report Highlights of events the District Manager or Staff attended on behalf of the Board
and upcoming events:
• Due to the generosity of Brookfield Properties, and the assistance of CB4
member Josephine Ishmon, the CB4 District Office was able to help deliver
$5,000 to the PTA’s of PS33 and PS51 for their re-opening needs.
• Email Blast Highlight: I recommend taking the time to look at our email
blast on the homeless situation in our district. It includes a report from the
City’s outreach teams with data on the number of folks housed as well as
clean up locations and recognized hotspots. It also includes information to
provide to people in need and ways the community can help.
• MCB4 and HCC hosted a second Tenants Rights Information Session on
Tuesday, September 15 at 6:00 pm.
• Full Board Voting: All Full Board members need to fill out their virtual
vote sheet immediately after the role-call vote is conducted. The office
cannot accept late vote sheets of any kind. The vote count listed in letters is
based on individual member vote sheets.
October Committee Updates and Board Reminders:
• The office will be closed on Monday, October 12.
• ACES Committee will be meeting on Tuesday, October 20.
• Budget Task Force will be meeting on Thursday, October 22.

Public Hearing: Manhattan Community Board 4’s Statement of District Needs and
Budget Requests
Presentations / Public
Hearings
Jessica Chait, the Second Vice Chair and Chair of the Budget Task Force, opened the
meeting for public comment on the Task Force’s proposal, which will be voted upon
by the members in the business session of the meeting. With no members of the
public having signed up to speak or anyone coming forward at the meeting, Ms. Chait
closed the hearing.
Public Session
Lucy Lieberman Ms. Lieberman is a resident of West 36th Street between 8th and 9th Avenues and has
been a frequent speaker at CB4 meetings to complain about the temporary hotel shelters
on her block – a matter that will be taken up in Agenda Item 12. She expressed her
frustration with the Department of Homeless Services and elected officials in general for
not resolving the issues that have been well-recognized since they began five months ago
when the area became over-populated with homeless shelter residents. She went on to
recount several recent incidents that occurred near the converted DoubleTree Hotel and
dismissed supposed corrective measures such as extra security and lighting as ineffective
superficial tactics. She stated that it was poor planning to concentrate so many shelters in
a one-block radius and the city should fix it by moving at least one of them. And even with
that, there would still be 500 temporary residents and 100 permanent residents in one
block.
Allen Marc Mr. Marc complained about the public safety issues due to the homeless population on
West 36th and 37th Streets despite the numerous community meetings where they were
discussed. He told of being recently harassed and having to endure constant loud music
and fighting in the streets. He blamed the Mayor and Speaker Johnson for being “missing
in action.”Randolph Barksdale Mr. Barksdale reiterated the concerns expressed by the previous speakers and thanked
CB4 for providing a forum to discuss them. Nevertheless, he complained that there has
been no improvement and believes that at least one shelter should be moved, preferably,
the DoubleTree Hotel shelter.
Lisa Wager Ms. Wager is the Director of the Office of Government Relations at the Fashion Institute
of Technology. She made the following announcements:
• The Museum at FIT Fall Fashion Culture programs have moved online and can be
viewed on the FIT YouTube channel at 6 pm on their designated day and run for
an hour. There will be a conversation tomorrow discussing Native American
fashion design moderated by a member of the Mississippi Choctaw tribe.
• Vogue has named the Museum’s podcast Dressed: The History of Fashion its
number one pick for fashion podcasts.
• FIT has ranked at or near the top of lists that account for parents and students
when they choose colleges. College Magazine has ranked FIT number one on its
top 10 list of colleges for aspiring fashion designers. They note prestigious alumni
such as Nina Garcia, Michael Kors, and Calvin Klein. Also, the online site Best
Value Schools ranked FIT second behind Syracuse University for best New York
institutions with online programming.
Brian Weber Mr. Weber is a resident of West 36th Street and the co-chair of the West 36th Street
Block Association who spoke in support of the letter that is the subject of Agenda Item 15.
He complained that attempts to solve the shelter density problem with increased security
and lighting, as Speaker Johnson and Senator Hoylman have endorsed, simply has not
worked. He recounted a recent incident where one of his neighbors was assaulted and
had to be rescued by her doorman as one example of the deplorable conditions on his
block. He called upon local elected officials to get the number of shelter beds on West
36th Street reduced.
Jane Greenman Ms. Greenman is the resident who was referred to by the previous speaker as having been
assaulted while entering her apartment. She is a recent widow who has lived in her
apartment for 16 years, during which time she said she has never felt unsafe. But
conditions have changed to the point where she does not leave her apartment even to
visit her children and grandchildren. She stated that they too feel unsafe coming to visit
her, as do her other friends.
Anne Santore Ms. Santore is a 71-year-old resident of West 36th Street who has lived on the block for
many years and has spoken frequently at CB4 meetings regarding the deteriorating
conditions that have resulted from the influx of shelter residents. She spoke of a family
she observed walking down Ninth Avenue where a woman was thrown to the ground by a
person who had mental health issues and could not be arrested because of his mental
condition. She stated that she has been unable to walk down Eighth Avenue since March
when the lockdown was imposed and reiterated her position that the problem with
temporary shelters is one of density. She estimated that there were approximately 200
permanent residents on the block and 800 male shelter residents. There are no women’s
shelters or family shelters. So, for perspective, she noted that there were 4 men for every
permanent resident on the streets every day.
Lynn Stefanelli Ms. Stefanelli has been a resident of West 36th Street for 20 years. She stated that the
longtime residents have become “the vulnerable minority, the disenfranchised, the
overlooked and under-represented” whose public health and safety are in jeopardy. She
said she takes her life in her hands every time she leaves her apartment across from theDoubleTree and has been verbally threatened with rape and has had the local
shopkeepers have to form a human chain around her to get home safely. Ms. Stefanelli
recited a long list of violent offenses against her neighbors that she has witnessed and
noted that she can no longer have clients come to visit her loft.
Mirian Natal Ms. Natal came to live in the community in 2003 with her husband and children. She
spoke about nearly being killed by an electric bike that was being ridden in the wrong
direction on the sidewalk. The rider left the scene without being identified, leaving Ms.
Natal with no one to sue for her injuries. She asked for help from the Governor’s office
and Speaker Johnson. Now she would like the Board’s help in finding a way to get e-bikes
identified by their owners in the future.
Remarks from Elected Officials and Representatives
Senator Brad The Senator thanked the public speakers for their moving testimony and assured them that
Hoylman he has been working with his colleagues to remedy an unacceptable situation. He stated
that he has walked the blocks and seen first-hand those things that have been described
and witnessed daily by members of the community. He noted that his request for a sit-
down meeting with the commissioner of DHS has gone unfulfilled and that this is of serious
concern because it is a necessary starting point.
He mentioned his re-election success and lamented the fact that the Senate was not able
to reach a Democratic super-majority of 42. He also mentioned his recent Washington Post
editorial dealing with familial violence.
The local office is partnering with Mt. Sinai Hospital to offer free flu shots outside of Penn
South on 8th Avenue and 26th Street on Tuesday, November 17 from 10 am to 3 pm.
Mr. Hoylman held a press conference about legislation that he carries that would
strengthen New York’s SLAPP statute. The term stands for strategic lawsuits against public
participation and refers to frivolous lawsuits brought by wealthy and powerful interests
such as the real estate lobby and developers such as Donald Trump to dampen criticism
from activists. One such activist who lives in the district, Mike McKee, has been sued by the
real estate lobby over the years, costing him and his advocates tens of thousands of dollars
in an attempt to silence him. The proposed legislation would require those who bring these
kinds of lawsuits to pay attorney’s fees if they lose.
The Senator introduced the Pandemic Self-Storage Act to place a moratorium on lien sales
during the pandemic of items held in self-storage units. The prohibition would also
continue for a short time after the pandemic is brought under control.
Mr. Hoylman is carrying legislation with Assemblymember Harvey Epstein called the Save
Our Storefronts Act. It is a major rent relief bill that will help small business owners across
the district by keeping them from being evicted and helping small landlords who have
leases with them. It offers support that is hoped to be replaced by support under a new
federal administration.
New legislation was passed in Albany that would amend the Administrative Code of the
City of New York to require all new homeless shelters to hold a public hearing on where theshelter will be located before it is sited within a community. This will be a way to avoid
problems like those on West 36th Street by giving residents, elected officials, and
community boards a say on new shelters.
Borough President Ms. Brewer provided her monthly updates:
Gale Brewer • She has been working on getting the tow pound moved off of Pier 76 and has been
assured that it will be gone by the end of the year. There are 50,000 cars towed
there each year and 195 cars towed there per day.
• Concerning waterside projects, she has been working on the helicopter problem.
There have been fewer complaints coming from CB4 than CB7, but she has been in
constant contact with New Jersey elected officials because it appears that most of
the tourist helicopters are coming from New Jersey.
• Ms. Brewer thanked the CB4 members of the NYCHA Chelsea Working Group for
their valuable contributions to the discussion concerning the implementation of
the RAD program in Chelsea. She noted that during her 40 years of dealing with
NYCHA issues, this is the most substantive and will serve as a model for RAD
programs throughout the city in terms of process and resident input.
• She is pleased with the commitment of DHS to finally participate in the discussions
surrounding the hotel shelters on the West Side. She has also been working with
DoITT to see how their apps and data can be used, in particular, to see if a single
call-in number can be established for contacting service providers.
• Ms. Brewer has been pushing the “public realm” proposal as a way to put someone
in charge of the City’s streets. Currently, 21 state and city agencies follow up on
street issues so it would be helpful to have a central source, especially in the time
of outdoor dining.
• Wastewater treatment has come a long way. Boston, for example, has found a way
to locate COVID hotspots by analyzing its wastewater and so have several countries
in Europe. The City has now begun doing the same with a DEP laboratory
conducting 35 tests per day. The goal is to conduct 80 tests per day and that will
happen as soon as new equipment arrives.
• Ms. Brewer served as a moderator in public meetings on police reform and found
that young people were the most articulate on the topic.
• Applications for community board membership will be released next month for
positions that will be filled next year.
Assemblymember Ms. Rosenthal offered the following updates:
Linda Rosenthal • Ms. Rosenthal was happy to note her re-election and confirmed that ballot
counting was still underway in many districts because of the large number of
absentee ballots that have not been processed. It is not important in most races,
but it is in a few tight races in both the Assembly and Senate. She introduced a bill
requiring that everyone who is eligible to vote would be mailed a ballot –
something that is already being done in New Jersey. She expressed her belief that
the City Board of Elections needs to be run more professionally with fewer partisan
squabbles and in a more streamlined fashion. Work will begin on this next year.
• The New York State agency Homes and Community Renewal was given $100
million to distribute to those who were unable to pay rent due to the COVID
pandemic. By the time the program ended, HCR had rejected 57,000 applications
out of 94,000 that were submitted. People were faced with a very cumbersome
application process where they would go through the website to the end where it
would crash, resulting in 11,000 people having to submit paper applications. Ms.Rosenthal stated her intention to return to Albany to remedy the situation and
continues to hope for a federal stimulus package as well.
• The annual Shred Day will be held on November 10 in front of the office at 230
West 72nd Street between 10 am and 3 pm.
• The state levied a large penalty on the City for neglecting to move the tow pound
and, still, the City continues to withhold information as to what sites have been
looked at as a replacement.
• The Parks Department is awaiting parts to restore DeWitt Clinton Park.

Presentation: NYC Health and Hospitals on COVID19 and Test and Trace Program
Chelsea Cipriano, the Executive Director of Inter-Governmental Affairs for the New
Presentations / Public
York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, began the slide presentation
Hearings
with one depicting the COVID-19 zones designated by the Governor in October.
Information on these changing zones can be accessed via the Zone Finder app here:
https://www1.nyc.gov/site/coronavirus/index.page .
She went on to describe the efforts being made to keep the public informed about
the pandemic and to curtail the spread of misleading data. She noted that COVID-19
cases and percent positivity were trending upward recently, and the City was working
to keep both down because doing so is key to keeping New Yorkers healthy and the
City open.
Laura Atlas, of NYC Test and Trace Corps, explained their program consists of three
programs: test, trace, and take care. She provided a list of testing sites in Manhattan
and other resources. She also reviewed the City’s particular version of tracing, which
is to use a mass testing strategy. It allows for determining where the virus is and how
high the threshold of transmission is. It also provides information about where
resources are needed. This all leads to the “take care” pillar of the program that is a
suite of services that all New Yorkers have access to when they test positive for the
virus. For example, the City issues advisories covering quarantining, living
arrangements, and services that enable living away from family members in a hotel,
cost-free. Such services as food and medicine delivery and dog walking are also
included.
Ms. Cipriano went over various advisories that offer guidance to older New
Yorkers and those with underlying health conditions. She also reviewed holiday and
travel advisories, and the four basic steps that one must take to prevent the spread
of COVID-19.
Ms. Atlas advised all New Yorkers to be tested regularly, even when not
experiencing symptoms. The frequency depends on lifestyle and circumstances, all of
which are described more fully on the Test and Trace website. The many resources
available to those who test positive and their contacts can be found there as well.
www.testandtrace.nyc
Ms. Atlas and Ms. Cipriano concluded their presentation with answers to
questions posed by Board members.Public Hearing: Physical Culture Establishment – Mind Body Project – Meditation &
Fitness establishment located at 217 Seventh Avenue.
Paul Devlin, Co-Chair of the Chelsea Land Use Committee, explained the
application for a physical culture establishment and asked for comments from the
public. No public speakers came forward and the hearing was closed.
Public Session
Brian Weber Mr. Weber is a resident of West 36th Street and the co-chair of the West 36th Street
Block Association. He spoke for the sixth month in a row about the ongoing problems
caused by the temporary shelters on West 36th Street and the need to reduce the density
of shelter beds in the West 30s. He stated that he knew of five of his neighbors who have
been physically assaulted and that there have been two homicides in the area within the
past 3 months. He complained about elected officials and DHS who continue to hold
meetings to discuss security when they should be having active discussions to relocate
one of the shelters. He also complained about the Garment District having the highest
COVID-19 infection per capita rate in the City and that testing only once a month in the
shelters is not enough, especially since many residents refuse to wear masks in public.
Christine Gorman Ms. Gorman is the president of the West 55th Street Block Association who spoke about
the Hell’s Kitchen Neighborhood Coalition that was recently formed to address the issue
of homelessness in the neighborhood. The group includes block associations, nonprofits,
businesses, and others. The group acknowledges the need for temporary shelters during
the pandemic but believes that, after almost a year, COVID cannot be used as an excuse
for mismanagement. The coalition aims to work with the City to improve the management
of the shelters in Hell’s Kitchen. She referred to a recent op-ed piece in the Daily News
that was written by Board members Maria Ortiz and Joe Restuccia who reviewed the work
of the coalition.
Catherine Lafferty Ms. Lafferty has lived in Hel’s Kitchen for 21 years. She thanked the previous speaker for
introducing HKNC and noted a press outing that took place in October on the corner of
West 36th Street and 9th Avenue with longtime business leaders, including the
grandchildren of the founders of Esposito’s Pork Store. They wanted to show that the
issues around homelessness are important to business owners as well as citizens in the
area.
Ms. Lafferty pointed out that members of the HKNC want a more consistent dialogue
between care providers and the DHS. She noted that many members have worked in
homeless shelters and volunteer in food pantries currently. They are seeking answers
from the City on long-term plans that will affect the neighborhood.
Travis Rodgers Mr. Travis is a resident of West 42nd Street and a member of the HKNC. He expressed
frustration with elected officials and leaders not being straightforward with residents in
proposing a plan to alleviate some of the pressures that the temporary shelters have
brought to bear on the community. He stated that Hell’s Kitchen has always been a
welcoming community and that it has done more than its fair share in providing for the
homeless. The neighborhood deserves an actual plan of action.
Elka Fears Ms. Fears is the president of the West 47th Street/48th Street Block Association. She
spoke in favor of Agenda Item 1, which deals with the DEP Project. She noted that herneighborhood needs more moderate- and middle-income housing and she wants HPD to
honor the promise that it made in 2009 to address that need. She also spoke in support of
Agenda Item 2, which deals with the restoration of The Windermere.
Lisa Wager Ms. Wager is the Director of the Office of Government Relations at the Fashion Institute
of Technology. She made the following announcements:
• The FIT Virtual Portfolio Day will be held on December 5th for students around
the state and the world who want to apply for admission to the School of Art and
Design. The event will run from 1-3 pm and will be hosted by faculty from each
major who will review portfolio requirements for admission. Prospective students
will learn tips for creating a professional portfolio and have a chance to chat live
with members of the admissions and financial aid teams.
• A team of FIT students took Third Place out of 1,600 international teams in this
year’s Adobe Analytics Challenge. Each year, a corporation supplies real data to
students who crunch the data and give recommendations on real business
problems. This year, Nike was the sponsor – past brand sponsors include Conde
Nast, T-Mobile, and Major League Baseball. The team won $6,000 and made a lot
of business connections.
Sharon Pope- Ms. Pope-Marshall created a program at Bike New York called Street Action Now. They
Marshall work with a cohort of City residents who are interested in conducting street audits to
improve the streets that they live on right within their community. The group collaborates
with the transportation committees of community boards and the Department of
Transportation.
Remarks from Elected Officials and Representatives
Assembly Member Mr. Gottfried got a bill passed in the legislature during the Summer that would strengthen
Dick Gottfried COVID contact tracing by guaranteeing a strong level of confidentiality for contact tracing
information. The bill prevents the sharing of information with law enforcement,
immigration, and others. It is awaiting action by the Governor. He thinks we will be seeing
this legislation enacted and that it would be something of a landmark nationally. It is
similar to the landmark that was created back in 1988 when the first HIV testing and
treatment confidentiality law was enacted. It was crucial to getting people to participate in
HIV testing and treatment and became a model around the country.
Mr. Gottfried acknowledged the growing discussion in the community about helicopters,
particularly helicopter traffic on and off the heliport in Hudson River Park at about 30th
Street. He and others have been working for decades trying to get the heliport moved to
cut down on noise. They have also worked to reduce helicopter volume around the City. He
does not believe there is any excuse for tourism in and around the City by helicopter, nor
helicopter traffic for business purposes. There has not been enough support for change at
either the state or federal level.
He noted that New York would be getting a relatively small allocation of COVID-19
vaccination rather quickly – 170,000 doses, which may seem like a lot, but is not when you
consider the tens of thousands of people in nursing homes and countless numbers working
in hospitals. New York is a state of 20 million people. All decisions about vaccination
priorities are being made, almost exclusively, by the Governor. He has issued a book-length
policy statement about how vaccines will be allocated, but Mr. Gottfried has not yet been
able to review it.Borough President Ms. Brewer provided her monthly updates:
Gale Brewer • She reassured the residents of West 36th Street that she and her staff have been
working tirelessly with CB4 and elected officials to find a solution to the shelter
problem and that she has had many discussions with the DHS commissioner. They
came up with one possibility, but it did not work out. Ms. Brewer stated that she
will ask the Department of Information Technology to digitize homeless outreach
data and shelter data for consolidation on the NYC Open Data portal.
• She has attended the meetings of the NYCHA Chelsea Working Group and praised
their efforts.
• There are about 700 hotels in the city – 60 of which are used for homeless shelters.
And, because there are so few tourists coming to the city now, there may be many
up for sale. She has been working with groups and an affordable housing task force
to call every hotel in the city to check on that possibility. The purpose, of course, is
to secure more permanent affordable housing units to replace those used for
transitional purposes.
• She thanked the Board for continuing the discussion about moving the tow pound
and mentioned that she had taken pictures of two sites on 11th and 12th Avenues
to better understand the City’s proposals. But the same problem persists with the
City and State being at odds over which site will be made available.
• She has been working on the helicopter noise problem with April Adams in her
office who determined that it is mainly due to helicopters coming from New Jersey.
She referred to a comprehensive research article by Julia Vitullo-Martin that was
published in the Gotham Gazette in November and strongly urged everyone to
read it. Talks with public officials and interested parties will occur in New York in
December and New Jersey in early 2021.
• Ms. Brewer believes that there should be a person in charge of the City streets – a
sort of public realm tzar. This person would work with DOB, Dot, MTA, and other
agencies to centralize decision making.
• The City has decided to cut 550 childcare slots in the Borough of Manhattan based
on the premise that there is more poverty in the outer boroughs. Ms. Brewer is
fighting to get them back because she knows that many of the people who come to
work in Manhattan are from low-income families who need Head Start and after-
school programs.
• There are 537 elementary and disabled students returning to school next week
who do not have the devices needed to fully participate. Ms. Brewer allocated
funds a year and a half ago to buy those devices, but the DOB has not done so. She
is pushing the DOB to act.
• Applications for new and current community board members are due on February
1.
Senator Robert Mr. Jackson provided the following updates:
Jackson • The Democratic majority gets back to work on December 7 and 8 to deal with the
impact that the pandemic has had on housing, food insecurity, and health care. Mr.
Jackson is part of a group that is pushing to increase taxes on billionaires and
millionaires to help pay for the economic damage caused by the pandemic. He
wants to deal with the prospect of landlords wanting to evict people at the earliest
possible moment. He wants to see help for those who cannot afford to pay rent
but wants those who can do so.
• The Governor signed into law a bill that the Senator sponsored and had been
pending for almost 20 years. It deals with violations in homes that pose a threat to
life, safety, or health and have not been cured within 60 days. Previously, alandlord could get multiple extensions to complete required work, and now a
landlord must apply to a court for an extension and must prove that it is justified.
• The Senator and his staff have been busy during the pandemic handing out food
bags, masks, and hand sanitizer. They will continue to do so until the pandemic
ends.
• Mr. Jackson and his deputy chief of staff met with the commanding officer of the
Midtown South Precinct and toured the area around West 36th Street. He
concluded, based on his observations, that the area is over-saturated with
homeless shelters and something should be done to reduce density.
Luke Wolf for Mr. Wolf gave the following updates for the Comptroller’s Office:
Comptroller Scott • At the start of the pandemic, the Comptroller launched an investigation into the
Stringer City’s response to find out why the City had become the epicenter of the pandemic
at that time. Now, 8 months later, the City has yet to supply a single document to
the Comptroller and he has taken the Mayor to court to enforce a subpoena for
those documents.
• The Comptroller is working to give equal access to education through remote
learning by ensuring that the 100,000 living at home and 30,000 students living in
shelters have internet access. He is doing that for those at home by subsidizing
“internet passports.” For those living in shelters, he has proposed a comprehensive
plan that can be viewed on his website.

children-of-new-york-executive-director-kim-sweet-op-ed-new-york-city-needs-to-
help-students-in-shelters-get-the-instruction-they-need/
• The Comptroller wrote an op-ed piece outlining greater transparency of the NYPD
through the CCRB. His plan can be viewed here:

accountability-for-nypd-misconduct-by-strengthening-oversight-authority-of-the-
civilian-complaint-review-board/
Hayley Berson for Some of Congressman Nadler’s efforts in Congress during the pandemic include 90
Congressman hearings, passing 78 bills out of the committee, shepherding 92 judiciary bills through the
Jerrold Nadler House of Representatives, and passing 30 judiciary bills into law. The MORE Act, which Mr.
Nadler sponsored, will be on the House Floor on Friday, December 4. Its formal name is the
Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act of 2019. The bill decriminalizes
marijuana at the federal level. The hearing can be viewed on C-SPAN.
Carl Wilson for Mr. Wilson announced two upcoming events:
Speaker Corey • The Virtual Tenant Resource Fair will be held in partnership with HPD on
Johnson Wednesday, December 9 from 6 – 8 pm. It will be a great opportunity to ask
questions related to housing protections during COVID, rent protections, the
housing lottery process, and when to use housing court.
• The Speaker is in the middle of his third annual Holiday Season Toy Drive with Holy
Apostles Soup Kitchen. The next designated drop-off day is Tuesday, December 8
from Noon to 5 pm. New, unwrapped gifts suitable for children 3 months to 17
years can be dropped off at the District Office, located at 224 West 30th Street.
Mr. Wilson also announced that earlier in the day, the City Council won a legal challenge to
several bills that were designated to protect residential and commercial tenants during the
pandemic. The lawsuit was brought on by landlords who had argued that the three bills,
which were a part of a larger COVID-19 relief package, violated their constitutional rights.
The District Court for the Southern District of New York rejected the property owners’
claim by ruling that the actions taken by the Council to combat COVID-19 and help New
Yorkers were reasonable to balance the infringement of contractual rights versus publicinterest needs in the middle of a pandemic. The Speaker thinks this is a major victory for
small business owners who need protection from landlords during a very unprecedented
time.

Street and Seventh Avenue.
John Greco Mr. Greco explained the reason for his decision to withdraw his SLA application for
Posh, the intended subject of agenda Item 26. He stated that the input from the block
associations at the BLP Committee made him and his business partner reconsider their
plans for a new establishment in the neighborhood.
Remarks from Elected Officials and Representatives
Assembly Mr. Gottfried commented on the results of the last election, noting that Democrats now
Member Dick have a majority in the State Senate with thirty-nine members – the largest majority since
Gottfried 1914. More striking, however, is that the makeup of the Legislature is more diverse. Overthe past two election cycles, more than two dozen freshman Assembly members have
been elected who did not have previous political experience, many of whom are women
and people of color. In the Senate, fifteen of the thirty-nine members are freshman.
Mr. Gottfried referred to the recent City Charter revision that imposes term limits on
community board members. His hope is that members who are affected by this will find a
way to stay involved in the process.
Vanessa Diaz for Ms. Diaz made the following announcements on behalf of the Borough President:
BP Gale Brewer  Applications are now being accepted for community board memberships.
 Capital funding applications for schools and nonprofits are being accepted
through February 25th.
 The office is working with community boards in preparation for the 2020 Census.

a free Learn-to-Tango event being held on Friday, February 8th from 6 to 8 pm.
Chris Mills Mr. Mills is the pastor at One Community Church in Hell’s Kitchen. They are holding a

Michael Steigman Mr. Steigman is the market manager for Down to Earth Farmer’s Markets, located on
West 23rd Street between 8th and 9th Avenues and West 34th Street at Hudson Yards.
Agenda Item 18 is a letter to DOT requesting parking on West 34th Street on Thursdays
during Spring through the Fall for vendors at the market. He asked the members to vote
in favor of the letter.
Marla Dafay Ms. Dafay is an advocate for persons with disabilities and, last year, volunteered to
assist CB4 in its efforts to identify small businesses in the district that comply with their
ADA requirements for wheelchairs. She and her colleagues counted 107 establishments
between West 34th Street and West 57th Street along Eighth and Ninth Avenues that
provide wheelchair access. Ms. Dafay is a board member of the group known as
Disabled in Action which has offered to distribute CB4’s ADA guidelines to small
businesses.
Remarks from Elected Officials and Representatives
Brian Lewis for Mr. Lewis made the following announcements on behalf of the Borough President:
Borough  The office is coordinating with community boards in connection with CityPresident Gale Planning’s proposed zoning text amendment to remove the “mechanical void”
Brewer loophole that allows developers to add unnecessary height to their high-rise
towers.
 Ms. Brewer joined Congressman Nadler in a letter to the USPS voicing their
dismay in the decision to move their finance station out of the Google Building
on Ninth Avenue without community input. They asked for the decision to be
scrapped and the process to be restarted.
 Applications for community board membership are due by 5 pm on Friday,
February 8th.
 Ms. Brewer will give her State of the Borough address at NYU’s Skirball Center
on Sunday, February 24th from 2 to 5 pm.
Carl Wilson for After having just returned from a vigil held for a cyclist who was killed by a truck at the
Speaker Corey intersection of 45th Street and Eighth Avenue, Mr. Wilson said there was much work that
Johnson the City needed to do to ensure the safety of cyclists. He thanked the board for its efforts
in that regard.
A briefing session was held with representatives from the Departments of Sanitation,
Health and Parks, along with those from every block association in the district between
Canal and 63rd Streets to address best practices for rodent prevention. There will be a
workshop at the Greenwich House Senior Center in the West Village to provide guidance
on how to create a block association on March 7th from 6:30 to 8:30 pm.
The annual Community Resource Fair is being held at John Jay College on February 13th
where free vision screening, blood pressure screening and flu shots will be available from
6:30 to 8:30 pm.
A scoping meeting for a new green space in Hell’s Kitchen on Tenth Avenue will be held
on Tuesday, February 12th from 6:30 to 8:30 pm at the Urban Gateway School, located at
439 West 49th Street. Participants can share their ideas on how to transform the vacant
City-owned lot between 48th and 49th Streets into a green space and have their input used
by NYC Parks in developing a schematic design that will be presented to CB4 for public
review.
Erica Overton for The Child Victims Act, co-sponsored in the Assembly by Ms. Rosenthal and in the
Assembly Senate by Brad Hoylman, was passed in both chambers on January 28th and is now
Member Linda awaiting the Governor’s promised signing. The law allows survivors of sexual assault to
Rosenthal sue their abusers and institutions until age 55, up from the current age of 23. It also
includes a one-year look-back window that allows others who were not able to sue in the
past to file fresh claims. Victims of criminal sexual abuse can now seek felony charges
until their 28th birthday and misdemeanor charges until their 25th birthday.
On January 29th, Ms. Rosenthal’s gun buyback legislation was passed in the Assembly
and the Senate as part of a comprehensive gun safety package that includes the banning of
bump stocks, strengthening background checks, limiting gun possession on school
grounds, and creating extreme risk protective orders.
During this past Summer, staff members from the assembly member’s office conducted a
sanitation survey in response to numerous complaints about the buildup of trash at many
locations in the district. After observing locations where trash was overflowing trash bins
and strewn about, the office sent a letter to the Department of Sanitation and was advised
that they had removed trash bins so that people would not litter. Realizing that the tactic
failed, Sanitation is now replacing the bins.
Taysha Clark for The Senate Majority Conference passed two bills sponsored by Senator Hoylman: The
State Senator Gender Expression Non-Discrimination Act (GENDA) and legislation to ban the use ofBrad Hoylman conversion therapy on minors under the age of 18 by mental health professionals.
GENDA prohibits discrimination based on gender expression or identity and adds
transgender New Yorkers to those protected by the state’s Hate Crime Law.
The Senator has taken part in the discussions regarding the Women’s Building and will
continue to monitor developments.
Robert Atterbury The first hearings in Congress on H.R. 1, the For the People Act of 2019, began on
for Congressman January 29th. The comprehensive bill strengthens our voting, campaign finance,
Jerry Nadler lobbying, and government ethics laws.
On this day, February 6th, the first hearing in eight years was held on gun violence.
Congressman Nadler, who is the new House Judiciary Chairman, opened the hearing with
a statement that can be seen here: https://nadler.house.gov/press-release/chairman-nadler-
opening-statement-hearing-preventing-gun-violence-america .
Acting Attorney General Whitaker is scheduled to appear before the Judiciary Committee
on Friday when he is expected to answer a long list of prepared questions about such
matters as his discussions with the President and his unwillingness to recuse himself from
the Special Counsel’s investigation. Next week, the committee will hold an oversight
hearing on the Trump Administration’s family separation policy that separated children
from their parents at the border.
Congressman Nadler joined other elected officials in a letter to the Federal Bureau of
Prisons and Department of Justice regarding the horrific conditions over the past week at
the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn where inmates were left with no power or
heat. He also joined the families of inmates, public defenders and New York lawmakers
on a tour of the facilities where they spoke to the warden and demanded immediate action
by the BOP. Electricity was restored on Sunday and efforts are underway to fix the
heating system.

March 2019 Full Board Meeting Minutes
Public Hearing: Manhattan Community Board 4 Response to the Fiscal Year 2020
PRESENTATIONS /
Preliminary Budget
PUBLIC HEARINGS
Jefferey LeFrancois, chair of the Budget Committee, summarized the work of the
committee and the Board’s response set forth in Agenda Item 18. No one from the
public came forward to speak.
Public Hearing: Citywide Mechanical Voids Text Amendment
J.D. Noland, chair of the Clinton/Hell’s Kitchen Land Use Committee, reviewed
the Board’s response to the CPC’s proposed zoning resolution text amendment
contained in Agenda Item 1. A representative of City Council Member Ben Kallos
voiced his support of the proposal.
Public Session
Ethan Goodman Mr. Goodman is a representative of the firm Fox Rothchild, the architects who designed
the parking garage that is the subject of Agenda Item 1. He made comments further to
those made at the Chelsea Land Use Committee meeting regarding what he believes is a
mischaracterization of the impact that the garage will have on pedestrian traffic in the
vicinity of the garage. He noted that a required finding for approval of the garage is that
pedestrian flow not be impeded by the presence of the garage on 18th Street. He stated
that the estimated 7,600 pedestrians cited in the Board’s proposed letter are not accurate
because most pedestrians would in fact be walking on the opposite side of the street. He
also mentioned that the garage is meant to fulfill a need in the community for additional
parking due to the recent construction of residential buildings that have not included
accessory parking.
Sally Carlson Ms. Carlson, a resident of the building located at 360 9th Avenue where New Mates
Global is seeking a liquor license, voiced her concerns about the application. She stated
that the applicant was slow to fulfill its promise to perform acoustical testing within the
premises and she worries that it might not live up to its other obligations.
Peggy Kauh Ms. Kauh represents a large building on 14th Street that has lost curbside access to its
secondary entrance due to work being done in connection with the L Train repairs. The
entrance is used for services and deliveries. She thanked the board for its continuing
support in addressing the needs of the many seniors and disabled children who live in
her 350-unit building.
1Michelle Jackson Ms. Jackson runs an initiative called Seeds to Soil located in the cooperative space at
424 West 54th Street. This summer they are building a rooftop residents’ garden in the
form of a labyrinth. A fundraiser is being held on Saturday, March 9th from 8 -11 pm at
Prime Produce, 424 West 54th Street.
Julia Knight and Ms. Knight introduced Poster House, the only museum in the country devoted
Samantha Hirsh exclusively to posters. It is dedicated to presenting the impact, culture, and design of
posters, both as historical documents and methods of contemporary visual
communication. Poster House, located at 119 West 23rd Street, is scheduled to open in
mid-June, with a community day event happening on June 1st.
Lisa Wager As the Director of Government and Community Relations at the Fashion Institute of
Technology, Ms. Wager reviewed current news and upcoming events at FIT:
• Kevin Mayes, a 1981 alumnus of FIT in Fashion Design, served as head tailor
on the film production of Black Panther for which Ruth Carter won an Oscar for
costume design. She was the first person of color – male or female – to win this
award.
• There is an exhibition called “Hattitudes” being held in the Art and Design
Gallery at the corner of Seventh Avenue and 27th Street – Friday will be its final
day. It was curated by forty-two students who took hats from the collection of
Nina Kurtis and created individual 360-degree displays featuring a hat from a
distinctive time period or fashion trend.
• FIT has been included – for the first time ever – in the list of U.S. colleges and
universities that produced the highest number of 2018-2019 Fulbright U.S.
Scholars. The awards went to: Deirdre Sato, dean for International Education;
Joseph Antee, associate professor of Fashion Business Management; and,
Brenda Cowan, associate professor of Exhibition and Experience Design.
Remarks from Elected Officials and Representatives
Brian Lewis for Mr. Lewis made the following announcements on behalf of the Borough President:
BP Gale Brewer • Now that the Community Board Application period is closed, new applicants
should have received an email invitation to sign up for one of the interviewing
sessions. There will not be any interviewing of reapplicants this year.
• The Borough President held her State of the Borough address on Sunday,
February 24th at NYU Skirball Center on the theme “What is Urban Policy
Now.” She touched on issues such as expanding broadband access, improving
bus service, addressing gentrification, and improving immigration graduation
rates. One highlight was a panel discussion with former Counsel to Mayor de
Blasio Maya Wiley, former Daily News columnist Juan Gonzalez, Center for an
Urban Future chief Jonathan Bowles, and Asian American Federation leader
JoAnn Yoo.
• The office has launched an Accessibility Taskforce that will handle outstanding
transportation and urban design accessibility issues as well as workforce
discrimination and development, education, and much more. The taskforce will
meet regularly in the months to come and will be comprised mostly of
accessibility advocates.
• As congestion pricing continues to be debated by state legislators, the Borough
President will be convening a public hearing on March 21st that will feature
testimony from Ms. Brewer, elected officials, transportation professionals and
advocates, and community stakeholders.
• On Wednesday, March 20th, the office will host its Women’s History Month
Celebration at 6 pm at Gibney Dance on Chambers Street. The focus will be onthe topic of incarcerated women.
• On March 7th, the office will be hosting an open house at the Northern
Manhattan Office for jobs with the U.S. Census Bureau in preparation for the
2020 Census. It will run from 4-6 pm and members of the Bureau will be on site
to answer questions and provide assistance.
Chris Nickell for Mr. Nickell made his first appearance at a CB4 board meeting representing newly-elected
State Senator Senator Jackson who shares representation of parts of the MCD4 district with Brad
Robert Jackson Hoylman. Mr. Jackson’s district runs from the top of Washington Heights down to
Chelsea along the far West Side and happens to be the most gerrymandered district in the
state. The Senator’s local office is near 214th Street, but he is exploring an office-sharing
arrangement with other elected officials in our district to provide greater access for
constituents.
The Senator is co-sponsoring a parallel bill to the City’s proposal relating to mechanical
voids which will have a State-wide reach and be a bit more restrictive. Another one of the
Senator’s bills deals with transparency in charter schools, compelling charter schools to
abide by the same standards of accountability and transparency as New York public
schools. The Senator is also fighting for full public funding for education, as he has since
launching his Campaign for Fiscal Equity in 1993 that resulted in a $16 billion payout for
the City’s public schools. He is a big proponent of the universal rent control package that
is being put forward by the Housing Justice for All Alliance. Mr. Jackson is opposing
Governor Cuomo’s attempt to lower the lobbying threshold because it would ensnare
even the smallest grassroots citizen groups that would be forced to register as lobbyists.
Matt Tighe for While Mr. Gottfried supports the City Planning zoning text amendment proposal on
Assembly mechanical voids, he has also co-sponsored a bill with Assembly Member Linda
Member Dick Rosenthal to amend the Multiple Dwelling Law as it relates to building heights – a
Gottfried missing component of the text amendment. The bill will require that all void space
exceeding either 5% of the total building height or 20 feet be counted toward total floor-
area-ratio (FAR). After that, each additional 12 feet of void space height will be counted
as an additional floor for the purposes of calculating total FAR. Further, the legislation
will count any ceiling height in excess of 12 feet as an additional floor. And, the
legislation will also ensure that open space, such as balconies and terraces not bordered
by four walls, be counted toward total FAR.
Mr. Gottfried’s New York Health Act, the single-payer health insurance plan, will be re-
introduced in the Assembly with the new addition of long-term care as part of the system.
The bill now covers care for all adults, senior citizens, and those with disabilities. The bill
was voted out of the Health Committee with a 17-to-8 vote and now moves on to other
committees, a full vote, and then to the Senate where the new Democratic majority may
finally approve the law.
New legislation that the Assembly Member has introduced includes a bill to
decriminalize adult sex work in New York. He believes that stopping sex work should not
be the work of the criminal justice system, which should focus its efforts on stopping sex
trafficking.
Tomorrow, March 7th, the MTA will be holding an open house on the new L Train plans.
It will take place from 6 – 8 pm at Our Lady of Guadalupe Church, located at 328 West
14th Street.
Kevin Jean The 2019 High School Internship Program began accepting online applications in
Baptiste for D.A. February and will continue to do so until March 11th. The program is open to high school
Cyrus Vance students who live or attend school in Manhattan. Applicants must attach a one-page
resume, 300-word essay and a letter of recommendation.
The D.A.’s Office also announced the Summer 2019 Gun Violence PreventionFellowship that provides young people with an opportunity to strategize on ways to
prevent gun violence in Manhattan communities. Applicants can be current college
students, or young adults on track to graduate high school or complete their GED by
Summer 2019. They must be personally affected by gun violence in their communities,
or families. All applications must be submitted by 5:00 pm on March 28th.
In February, the D.A. secured a conviction in the first ever prosecution of murder as an
act of terrorism. It involved the stabbing death of a man on a sidewalk in Hell’s Kitchen
by a white supremacist who was attempting to start a race war. He was sentenced to life
in prison without the possibility of parole.
The D.A.’s Manhattan Construction Task Force will be making a presentation on April
10th before the Clinton/Hell’s Kitchen Land Use Committee.
Jessie Kay for Ms. Kay reviewed some of the Congresswoman’s recent priorities:
Congresswoman • She has been working to fully fund the Victims Compensation Fund as a result of
Carolyn Maloney the recent announcement that funds were going to be cut due to budget shortfalls.
In response, she joined other legislators in submitting bipartisan legislation called
the Never Forget the Heroes: Permanent Authorization of the September 11th
Victim Compensation Fund Act. It will restore any cuts to awards, ensure that
any future victims will be fully compensated, and make the VCF permanent.
• She has also been working on census outreach and held her first Town Hall in
Manhattan with Council Member Carlina Rivera to discuss how they are working
to ensure a fair and accurate Census count. And following the Supreme Court’s
decision to hear an appeal by the Trump Administration of a district court order
that removed a citizenship question from the 2020 Census, she stated: “Our
constitution clearly mandates that every single person living in this country must
be counted every 10 years. The Supreme Court must recognize this clear
constitutional requirement to count everyone and reaffirm that the citizenship
question violates that mandate.”
• A bill was passed in the House that would require universal background checks
for all gun sales, thereby closing the so-called gun show loophole.
• The Congresswoman will be hosting her State of the District address at Hunter
College on Sunday, March 10th from 1:00 – 2:30 pm.
Board Reports & Business
Adoption of Agenda and The Agenda, as amended to include new Items 25 and 26, and the February
Minutes minutes were unanimously approved.
Highlights of events the District Manager or Staff attended on behalf of the
District Manager Report board and upcoming events:
Meetings\Events attended by CB4 staff on behalf of the board:
• District Manager provided testimony in front of the Government

• CLU and HHHS Committees are holding a joint meeting on
Monday, March 18th at 6:30 pm at 353 West 30th Street
•
All other committees will be meeting at their regular times andlocations
There were several small meetings over the course of the month dealing with the
Board Chair Report replacement of the Women’s Detention Center at the corner of 20th Street and
11th Avenue. Even though there has been a proposal and discussion between
City and State officials, the project is still very much a work in progress.
Mr. Lazarin noted that March is the month when community board
memberships expire. Some members choose to reapply for another term, while
others choose to retire. This year, three members have chosen not to reapply and
were given the opportunity to say a few words about their plans. Andrea
Bernard, Austin Ochoa and Barbara Davis each gave brief statements.

April 2019 Full Board Meeting Minutes
Presentation: by Julie Menin, Director, Office of the Census for New York City on
the Mayor’s 2020 Census Program, and Jolie Goldin of the U.S. Census Bureau.
PRESENTATIONS /
PUBLIC HEARINGS
The Office of the Census for New York City is focused on ensuring a fair and
accurate population count of New York City through the federal 2020 Census
survey. The Office came into being as a result of the possibility that the Census will
contain – for the first time in seventy years – a question regarding citizenship. There
is great concern that the question will stop a large portion of the population from
completing the survey. The Office aims to inform residents of the importance of
their individual participation and that the City has a great deal to lose if the
population is under-counted. At stake is the City’s fair share of the $800 billion for
federally funded programs that is distributed nationwide. Affected programs in the
City include public schools and housing, senior centers, SNAP, Medicaid, roads and
bridges, and more. The City cannot afford to have an even lower participation rate
than the 61.9% it did in 2010 as a result of fears associated with citizenship. The
Office’s outreach team will be working with CB4 on a continuing basis after the
survey is mailed out next March. And, because the survey can be completed online,
there will be multiple locations where people can respond – civic centers, houses of
worship, senior centers, libraries, pop-up centers and community board meeting
places.
Ms. Goldin provided general information about the Census, including the fact
that it seeks to count 300 million people in 140 million households. The Census is
the source of information that determines how many representatives each state gets
in Congress. An undercount in New York could result in the loss of two seats.
Applications for Census taker and other jobs can be submitted online at:
www.2020census.gov/jobs .
The Census will be delivered on March 12th when counting will begin online, by
phone and by mail. The database will be open for business in 12 different languages
with online support in 47 other languages. The count must be completed and
presented to the President by December 31, 2020; counts will be released for
redistricting by April 1, 2021.
Presentation/Public Hearing: ULURP Application for 201-207 7th Avenue – HPD
and Asian Americans for Equality
Joe Restuccia, Co-Chair of the Housing, Health & Human Services Committee,
opened the hearing with a brief description of the site and its history, dating from1976 as a City-owned property that is now going to be re-developed through an HPD
program that supports the development of affordable co-op apartments. He noted the
many meetings that have been held since August of 2017 with Council Speaker
Johnson, HPD, CB4 members and committees, Asian Americans for Equity (the
developer), and Aime Gross Architects – all of which have culminated in this
ULURP application. A full description of the application is contained in the letter
that will be voted upon in Agenda Item 1. He then turned the meeting over to Veanda
Simmons, the Director of Manhattan Planning at HUD.
Ms. Simmons indicated that the ULURP application was certified on January 28th
and that she has had multiple meetings with all of the parties involved, both before
and after that certification. She said she was pleased to have reached the point where
re-located tenants would finally be back in one of the new 26 affordable units. She
then turned the meeting over to representatives of the development team, HUD, and
Aime Gross who each presented the details of their work.
Keyla Espinal, the sole public speaker, is one of the re-located tenants of the site.
She was born in one of the apartments where she grew up with her family and said
that she was excited about getting back to her building. She asked the Board to
approve the application.
Public Session
Michael Huaraci Mr. Huaraci, who lives near the Port Authority Bus Terminal, presented a petition signed
by more than 500 residents calling for the renovation plans to include more green space
in the area. Specifically, Lot D between 37th and 38th Streets should contain a full
public park rather than the micro-space that has been proposed.
Rich Rickaby Mr. Rickaby gave a visual presentation of the wayfinding signs proposal that he initiated
and is the subject of Agenda Item 21. The proposal calls for the installation of cardinal
direction signs near subway exits to assist pedestrians to find their way upon reaching
street level.
Barbara Eastman Ms. Eastman also advocated for more green space and believes it should be located
beside the Dyer Avenue entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel because of the large number of
residents in the area.
Chris Mills Mr. Mills and his wife are starting a new church, known as One Community Church, to
serve in Chelsea, Hell’s Kitchen and Hudson Yards. He announced two upcoming
events: an informational session on April 14th at 500 7th Avenue; and, a garage sale in
conjunction with the 44th Street Better Block Association on June 1st from 10 am to 5
pm on West 44th Street between 9th and 10th Avenues.
Betty Mackintosh Ms. Mackintosh announced the eighth growing season of the Hell’s Kitchen Farm
Project, which is located on the roof of Metro Baptist Church at 410 West 40th Street.
Vegetables grown on the farm are given out in the basement-level food pantry of the
church. All volunteer farmers are welcome. An open house will be held on Saturday,
April 13th. There is also a summer internship program for high school youth that runs
from July 10th to August 17th. Flyers were made available.
Jane Ritter Ms. Ritter who lives at 77 7th Avenue spoke in support of Option 2 of the 14th Street
Traffic Mitigation and Bus Plan. She and the residents of her building want the parking
and loading zone to be located on the North side of 14th Street to allow for free access to
the building’s service entrance.
Matt Robinson Mr. Robinson asked the Board to coordinate with the other community boards that arealso dealing with the issues relating to the 14th Street bus plan.
Nathan Oliver Mr. Oliver, representing Bike New York, announced its annual Five Boro Bike Tour that
will take place on May 5th. It is the organization’s main fund-raising event and provides
funding for bike-riding and bike maintenance classes throughout the City.
Paul Groncki Mr. Groncki lives on West 16th Street between 6th and 7th Avenues. He thanked the
Board and the Transportation Committee for their work on the M7 Bus re-routing from
16th Street onto 18th Street.
Shaunte Mosely Ms. Mosely spoke for the Ryan-Chelsea Health Center, noting that it offered primary
and specialty care, as well as fitness classes five days a week. She made flyers available.
Mike Dale Mr. Dale is the business operations manager for a public school located at 41st Street
and 10th Avenue. He is advocating for more green space near the school – necessary
space for recreation in an area with constant heavy traffic.
James Harvey Mr. Harvey, of 301 West 48th Street, said he was attending his first CB4 meeting as an
advocate for the homeless through Pathways for the Homeless. He asked the community
to come together to fight homelessness,
Remarks from Elected Officials and Representatives
Assembly Mr. Gottfried noted that Pier 40, while not a part of MCD4, is a part of Hudson River
Member Dick Park – the larger entity that includes the district. He stated that some of the financial
Gottfried needs of the Park must be met by Pier 40 commercial projects which come under review
by MCB2. Currently, the Pier houses only a large parking facility with a soccer field in
the middle. The parking facility was slated to be moved and replaced many years ago, but
the NYPD, which is responsible for such action, has not done so. He suggested that, when
the time comes for development to be approved for Pier 40, the same level of restrictions
that will apply to Pier 76 in MCD4 be applied to Pier 40. MCB4 should not have to
contribute more to the Park when, in fact, it enjoys less green space than MCD2.
The new State budget was passed on April 1st. Even though New York has experienced
reduced federal aid and lower-than-expected revenue, the budget will still do more for
mass transit, education, the environment and criminal justice reform. Although the budget
includes substantial in State aid to New York City public schools and increased funding
for Medicaid, it was not enough. There are four key factors that led to this outcome:
1) The new State leadership had pledged not to support any new taxes.
2) Estimates of available tax revenue provided by the Comptroller and the Governor
were lower than expected.
3) The Governor continues to insist on a 2% limit on year-to-year growth in state
spending. That reduction this year was even tighter than the reduction in State
revenue, resulting in more funds being set aside in the State’s “rainy day fund”
than were put aside last year.
4) The State Constitution gives the Governor overwhelming authority in setting the
State budget.
The Trump administration is proposing a new rule governing Title X funding for family
planning. It would block funding of any entity that refers patients for abortion. New York
gets about $16 million of such funding and much of it goes to Planned Parenthood. The
Assembly has set aside $16 million in the budget to offset the gap in funding if the federal
cuts goes through.State Senator The Senator discussed the FY2020 State Budget, the first one for the new Democratic
Brad Hoylman Majority, noting that it was not perfect, but still one that he was proud to have voted for
because it supports vulnerable communities, protects the environment, funds important
programs and infrastructure, and generally serves as a counterweight to the Trump agenda
in Washington. So, while the Budget fell short on education funding, public financing of
elections, NYCHA, and the legalization of recreational marijuana, its accomplishments
include measures relating to:
 Congestion Pricing to help fund the MTA, as well as reduce traffic, clean the air,
and make the streets safer.
 Criminal Justice Reform to end cash bail for most crimes, ensure speedy trials,
reform the discovery process, and limiting the forfeiture of personal assets.
 Foundation Aid increases of $618 million for public schools and a three-year
extension of mayoral control of New York City schools.
 Vulnerable New Yorkers by securing funding for Runaway & Homeless Youth
programs, Holocaust survivors, and the Nurse-Family Partnership program.
 Voting Reforms by securing funding for early voting, the use of electronic poll
books, online voter registration, and mandatory paid time off for employees to
vote on Election Day.
 A Statewide Ban on Plastic Bags with a 5-cent fee on paper bags.
 LGBTQ Community program funding for groups such as GMHC and SAGE.
The Senator’s Robocall Prevention Act passed in committee last week. It would require
telemarketers and debt collectors to obtain the express consent of New Yorkers before
targeting them with robocalls. It would also compel telephone service providers to make
their call-blocking tools available free of charge to all customers.
The Senate passed Mr. Hoylman’s bill requiring more transparency from the State Liquor
Authority by making the stipulations connected to a liquor license viewable online.
Brian Lewis for Mr. Lewis made the following announcements on behalf of the Borough President:
BP Gale Brewer  The BP continues to work with CB4 and the NoVo Foundation to resolve issues
surrounding plans for the former Seaman’s House YMCA/Bayview Correctional
Facility. She will be convening a meeting with elected officials on April 11th.
 The Garment District Alliance Special Programming committee will hold its
inaugural meeting this week. The committee is a key component of the city’s
plan to preserve fashion manufacturing tenants in the Garment District.
 The office will announce community board appointments by mid-April. New
applicants’ terms begin effective immediately; departing members should
continue to attend meetings until announcements are made.
 A congestion pricing plan, the first in the nation, was recently approved and it
will impose a fee on most vehicles when they enter Manhattan south of 61st
Street, with revenues to be directed mostly to the MTA. A commission is slated
to nail down the details by the end of 2020 and implement the congestion plan as
early as 2021.
 Ms. Brewer recently sponsored a bill in the City Council (along with Speaker
Johnson and Congress Member Rosenthal) that calls for the establishment of a
database for vacant storefronts. The bill requires landlords to list vacant
storefronts, how long they have been empty, the asking rent and contact
information for the landlord.
 The office will be celebrating Earth Day – Monday, April 22nd – by distributing
thousands of reusable bags to grocery stores throughout Manhattan. Locations
will be posted on the Borough President’s website.
Robert Atterbury There was much recent activity in Congress that involved Judiciary Committee Chairman

declaration.
 Worked with Assembly Member Gottfried and the tenants of the Polyclinic

Carl Wilson for The Speaker gave his first State of the City address on March 5th during which he called
Speaker Corey for municipal control of New York City’s mass transit system and for revolutionizing the
Johnson way in which we plan our street space. The 104-page plan can be found on the Council’s
website:
http://council.nyc.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/LetsGo_Transit_Report.pdf

Board Chair Report Mr. Lazarin noted the resignation of Italo Medelius, one of the co-secretaries
and that he was going to appoint someone to complete his term which ends at
the end of the year. He asked for volunteers. He also noted that because Barbara
Davis was resigning, her co-chair position on the Housing, Health and Human
Services Committee was vacated and he appointed Maria Ortiz to replace her.
He made reference to the $46,000 that was left over from last year’s fiscal
budget. The Board was able to make use of some of those funds to hire Tony
Robbins to research sites in Hell’s Kitchen that might justify the creation of a
Hell’s Kitchen Historic District. He has experience with his work on the Special
West Chelsea District. His report is due by the end of June.
He asked the members to consider forming a Census taskforce to inspire interest
in the Census among community residents.

Lisa Wager As the Director of Government and Community Relations at the Fashion Institute of
Technology, Ms. Wager reviewed current news and upcoming events at FIT:
 IBM has collaborated with the FIT/Infor Design and Technology Lab to leverage
IBM’s artificial intelligence (AI) for fashion capabilities. Students from Fashion
Design and three programs in the Business School will work with IBM’s AI teams
to help leading fashion companies develop solutions to challenges in product
design, merchandising, planning and allocation, and customer sales and service. At
the same time, FIT faculty will be looking at how to integrate some of IBM’s AI
tools into the curriculum in Math, Science, Creative Technology and Design, and
FBM.
 Several exhibitions of graduating students from the School of Arts and Design will
be installed throughout the FIT campus from Wednesday, May 15th through
Wednesday, May 22nd. The exhibitions will display the best work of graduating
students in every department in Arts and Design.
Marni Halasa Ms. Halasa spoke on behalf of the activist group Fight for NYCHA that recently held a
protest campaign against NYCHA’s privatization plans for the Fulton and Elliot/Chelsea
developments, as well as other developments in Manhattan and Brooklyn covering 62,000
apartments that would be managed by private developers. The plan would come under the
federal Rental Assistance Demonstration program and would convert these units to federal
Section 8 housing. Ms. Halasa cited federal studies that found the RAD program involves
insufficient vetting of managers and too little oversight by NYCHA. She also gave
examples of cases where tenants have lost their apartments under RAD.
Rick Criswell Mr. Criswell is the general manager of the McKittrick Hotel on West 27th Street next door
to Il Bastardo. He noted the letter that he sent to the Board recently complaining about the
stress that Il Bastardo’s customers have created for his staff. He stated that he had to hire
additional security to deal with the problem. He asked the Board to approve the BLP letter.
Jeffrey LeFrancois Jeffrey is Second Vice Chair of the Board but spoke in his capacity of Executive Director
of the Meatpacking BID. He announced their annual electronics recycling event that will be
held on Friday, May 10th between 11am and 4pm. The drop off location is on 14th Street
just West of 8th Avenue on the south side of the street. There is no limit on the number of
items that will be accepted.
Pamela Wolff Pamela is a public member of the Chelsea Land Use Committee. She spoke as a resident of
Chelsea in favor of the letter that is the subject of Agenda Item 4. She asked that the letter
be approved in its entirety as it reflects the vital importance of preserving the historic
building located at 418 West 20th Street.
Remarks from Elected Officials and Representatives
State Senator Senator Jackson made his first appearance before the Board since his election last year to
Robert Jackson represent the 31st Senate District – the narrow strip along the West Side that runs from
Marble Hill down to Chelsea. The Senator is the Chair of the Committee on Cities, as well
as a member of several others, including Education, Higher Education, Labor, and Housing
& Buildings. He has focused his political career on full funding of public education from thetime he was a school board president, through his twelve years on the New York City
Council, and up to the present. His main battle has been with the State in getting the $4
billion of court-mandated funding that has been overdue for years. He indicated that it might
finally happen now that Democrats are the majority in both chambers but admitted that the
Governor still holds veto-proof control in Albany by virtue of the Silver v. Pataki decision of
the Court of Appeals. He said the Democratic Party should push to gain another five or six
seats in the Senate to overcome this obstacle.
He spoke about a farm worker bill he sponsored that would amend the Labor Law to require
farm workers and domestic workers to be given at least one day of rest per week like other
employees in New York. He said that this action was needed because farm workers are
prohibited from joining unions in New York.
The Senator stated that there are nine bills in the Assembly that have to do with affordable
housing and that he supports all of them. One, for example, would impose a vacancy tax on
vacant or abandoned storefronts; another would prohibit landlords from charging tenants for
legal fees without a court order.
Brian Lewis for Mr. Lewis made the following announcements on behalf of the Borough President:
BP Gale Brewer  He congratulated the newly appointed members of the Board and noted that the BP
had to make some tough cuts: for every 1 appointed candidate, six others were not
able to be appointed. He noted, however, that there were other opportunities for
community service, such as CECs, Neighborhood Advisory Committees and
Community Advisory Boards. One should contact the BP’s Director of Community
Affairs, Rosie Mendez, regarding those options.
 He asked all Board members to save the date for the annual CB Reception at the
Museum of Natural History, which will be held on Wednesday, May 29th from 6-
8pm.
 A very productive meeting was held on April 11th between stakeholders in the bid
to convert the former Bayview Correctional Facility into the Women’s Building.
Though all sides support the mission of the Women’s Building, there had been some
difficult unresolved questions that had been brewing over the past few months.
During the discussion, it emerged that there was more common ground and
willingness to collaborate than many realized.
 Staff members attended the inaugural session of the Garment District Alliance
Programming Committee on April 4th. It is expected that the committee will soon
distribute a draft RFP for programming that will utilize the $25 million allocated to
support the garment manufacturing industry that characterizes the district.
 There has recently been much talk surrounding the City’s plans for NYCHA’s
Fulton and Elliot/Chelsea Houses. The BP joined with other elected officials in
calling on the City to release their plans to the public so that the community will
have an opportunity to understand what is in store for their homes before they can
meaningfully contribute to the conversation. The letter makes clear, whatever the
plan is, that there will be no support for a plan that displaces or evicts residents, and
which otherwise does not protect the communities of Fulton and Elliott/Chelsea.
 The Mayor’s Office/DOT just announced that they will be moving forward with
what they call a Transit-Truck-Priority Pilot on 14th Street during the L Train
shutdown. This is a follow-up design to the originally planned and much-discussed
Busway. A few weeks ago, the BP sent a letter to DOT requesting that they choose
to move forward with the Busway plan, one of the two options they were weighing
against traditional SBS lanes like the ones on 23rd and 34th Streets. The BP knows
that there are legitimate concerns by those living on the side streets adjacent to 14th
Street regarding traffic spillover onto 13th and 15th Streets and that there must be
constant monitoring in the area. The Charter Revision Commission will hold its Manhattan hearing on a preliminary
staff report on proposed changes to the NYC Charter in the City Council Chambers
on May 9th at 6pm. Everyone is encouraged to read the proposals on the website
charter2019.nyc and testify. Written testimony can be submitted online at
chater2019.nyc/submit-your-ideas.
 With Stonewall 50 and World Pride right around the corner, the BP has announced
her Pride Ball at the Alhambra Ballroom in Harlem. Details and RSVP are
forthcoming.
Matt Tighe for The latest news from the MTA is that the M7 bus will be re-routed in June to allow for
Assembly the bus to make a left turn onto 14th instead of 16th or 18th Streets. Trucks will also remain
Member Dick on 14th Street and not be re-routed.
Gottfried
In the joint letter to NYCHA regarding Fulton Houses, it was stressed that the authors
would not allow any plan to advance that does not protect and preserve the Fulton Houses
community, that involves the displacement of residents from the Fulton Houses property, or
that diminishes tenant rights or affordability.
The Congressman was the lead co-sponsor of a Green amendment to the state
constitution that passed in the Assembly and is expected to pass in the Senate. If it does, then
it would have to be re-introduced in the next legislative session to get on the ballot in 2021.
The amendment would effectively say that each person has a right to clean air and water and
a healthful environment.
The Assembly took up the issue of maternal mortality this month as a result of increased
maternal mortality in the City and a finding that there is a wide disparity in incomes of
mothers who die during childbirth. Black women in New York are two to three times more
likely to die than white women. A bill was introduced to create a Maternal Mortality Review
Board that would review every death, identify causes and establish strategies to reduce the
risk. The bill is awaiting the Governor’s signature.
Dimandja On April 16th, in partnership with the Secret Service and the U.S. Postal Service, the D.A.
Utshudi for D.A. announced the first-of-its-kind indictment of a dark web storefront that sold and shipped
Cyrus Vance drugs to people in 43 states and laundered about $2.3 million in cryptocurrency. The D.A.
was able to pursue the indictment through information obtained about suspicious ATM
withdrawals in New York and New Jersey.

Public Session
Mary McGee Ms. McGee is a resident of the Fulton Houses in Chelsea. She is opposed to the proposed
development plan for the complex and believes that the existing buildings are structurally
sound and merely need funding for repairs.
Jaqueline Lara Ms. Lara is also a resident of the Fulton Houses and, having been relocated there out of a
homeless shelter, is upset to learn that her apartment might be demolished. She, too,
opposes the City’s proposed development plan.
George Weaver Mr. Weaver, also a Fulton Houses resident, expressed his disappointment with Speaker
Johnson, believing that he should be doing more to protect the interests of the residents at
his complex.
Marni Halasa Ms. Halasa is the founder of a group known as Fight for NYCHA that advocates on behalf
of all NYCHA residents. She asked the Board to support its resolution for the imposition of
a 1% tax on all corporations with more than a thousand employees in the City so that the
revenue it generates can be used to fund NYCHA. She stated that Fulton Houses needs only
$168 million, which represents a mere two-tenths of one percent of the annual City budget,
and the City should find a way to allocate it to the Fulton Houses.
She also stated that the residents of Fulton Houses have formed an independent tenant’sassociation that is separate from the one headed by Miguel Acevedo because of their belief
that he is not adequately representing them. The new group held a rally in front of City Hall
and had a press conference before the latest community meeting on Tuesday. They are
seeking CB4’s support.
Paul Gronki Mr. Gronki is the president of the West 16th Street Block Association. He spoke about the
14th Street bus plan, noting that the bus stop a Fifth Avenue should be re-instated as its
absence presents a real hardship to the elderly. On a separate note he stated that Chelsea
does not need any more market-rate housing.

PRESENTATIONS /
PUBLIC HEARINGS
Public Session
Paul Gronki Speaking on behalf of the West 16th Street Block Association, Mr. Gronki hoped that the
increased signage requested in the Board’s letter to DOT would in fact deter trucks from
turning onto 16th Street off 7th Avenue. As to the letter to DOT regarding experimental
loading spaces in his neighborhood, he noted that the “No Parking” signs used to enable
loading and unloading by FedEx and others were confusing because drivers are not aware
of the fact that the signs are intended for their benefit. He also voiced opposition to the use
of air rights from NYCHA to subsidize private development because Chelsea does not need
any more market-rate housing.
Tyrone Anthony Mr. Anthony, who lives at 300 West 46th Street near 8th Avenue, is opposed to the
application of Wabo Cabo for a liquor license because he believes the establishment will in
fact be a nightclub and not a restaurant. He noted the existing noise issues on his block
would be exacerbated by Wabo Cabo due to loud music, vibrations, and after-hours traffic.
Mary McGee Ms. McGee is a resident of Fulton Houses who believes her Chelsea neighborhood is over-
developed and any further development would not benefit existing residents of Fulton
Houses. She agrees with the position taken by the Board in its letter to NYCHA (Item 43)
but made clear her vehement opposition to the RAD program because it replaces
guaranteed benefits coming from NYCHA under Section 9 with uncertain funding under
Section 8. She wants the Board to delay sending its letter to NYCHA until the residents of
Fulton Houses have had the opportunity to meet with the Board.
Linda Ocasio Ms. Ocasio has been a resident of Fulton Houses for forty years and, she too, is opposed to
the NYCHA proposal. She noted that her development is at risk, even though it is one of
the best-maintained developments in the NYCHA system. She believes that there are
untapped sources of revenue to make repairs, making privatization accompanied by
demolition unnecessary.
Bobby Vangelatos The Deputy Center Manager of the Chelsea Recreation Center announced an upcoming
back-to-school event on Tuesday, September 3rd where children will be given book bags
and school supplies. A forthcoming flyer will provide details.
Lee Shepard Mr. Shepard lives in Manhattan Plaza at 43rd Street and 10th Avenue. He is concerned
about increasing quality-of-life issues from public urination to drug dealing that he haswitnessed over recent years. He wants to see more police officers patrolling the
neighborhood.
Robert Nolan Mr. Nolan lives at 301 West 45th Street in a building that abuts the Cabo Wabo property.
He is concerned about the live and recorded music noise, vibrations and, most importantly,
the crowds forming around the establishment. He characterized Cabo Wabo as a nightclub
that happens to serve food and noted that the location has never housed and establishment
that had a liquor license.
Thomas Blewitt Mr. Blewitt lives at 300 West 46th Street. He endorsed earlier comments made in
opposition to Cabo Wabo but emphasized the safety issues arising from large groups of
people exiting the establishment onto 8th Avenue through a bike lane.
Roberto Mr. Rodriquez has lived in Fulton Houses since 1946. He made a case for government
Rodriquez finding the money for public housing by referring to the first public housing being built and
the enactment of the Public Housing Act during the Great Depression.
Lisa Wager As the Director of Government and Community Relations at the Fashion Institute of
Technology, Ms. Wager reviewed current news and upcoming events at FIT. She
highlighted the work of two teams of FIT students who participated in the fourth annual
Biodesign Challenge in June. The competition brings together student teams from 34
colleges and universities from around the world who present concepts and research into
biologically inspired fibers and other materials. One team presented their research on a
biodegradable alternative to Spandex, which is not biodegradable and is contained in 80%
of clothing. The other team won the top prize for sustainable fashion for its work on faux
fur made entirely from milkweed fluff, flax, and other natural materials.
Remarks from Elected Officials and Representatives
Assemblymember Mr. Gottfried credited the new Democratic majority for the success of the last legislative
Dick Gottfried session. He made the following comments:
● We can expect medical marijuana and health care to be on next year’s agenda.
● He is concerned that the redevelopment plans for Pier 40 might be too restrictive in
allowing what can be developed there. Because Pier 40 relies on revenue-producing
developments, this has the potential to limit funding.
● He wants nothing to go forward at Fulton Houses until a working group is
established – one that includes representatives of residents and the community.
Brian Lewis for Mr. Lewis gave updates and made the following announcements:
BP Gale Brewer  Everyone is invited to apply for community board placements. The Borough
President’s office is particularly sensitive to the need to have representation from
public housing.
 The Borough President remains opposed to the demolition of public housing and the
Fulton House Working Group is calling for all possible options to remain on the
table.
 The BP’s’ office attended a rally for tenants at 336 West 17th Street for tenants
facing neglect and is lending its support to the residents of 219 West 24th Street
which is up for demolition as a result of neglect.
 Held public hearings on the issue of zoning loopholes
 Leading a Complete Count Committee for the 2020 census
 Supporting a bill to require landlords to register vacant storefronts
 BP’s office issued $29M of capital funds to fill holes in the city budget Upcoming events include:
o Fresh Food for Seniors program – see flyer
o Dominican Day Parade Kick-Off Event on August 1; parade August 11
o Know Your Rights Forum on August 5
 African American Day Parade September 15
State Senator Senator Jackson introduced Chris Nickell, his Deputy Chief of Staff. He went on to
Robert Jackson announce his intention to visit all the neighborhoods in his district through a program he
calls “Senator on your Corner.” He and his staff are preparing for the 2020 Census.
The Senator believes that the Senate accomplished a great deal in the last session, but more
needs to be done in the areas of health care for all New Yorkers, and Electoral Fusion.

September 2019 Full Board Meeting Minutes
Presentation: Update on 2020 Census Events in Community District 4
PRESENTATIONS /
PUBLIC HEARINGS
Joli Golden of the U.S. Census Bureau gave the presentation and stated that
Community District 4 has a hard-to-count tract, which means that in 2010 more than
30% of residents did not self-respond. She is therefore seeking more partners in the
district who can energize the community and facilitate the count. She thanked CB4 for
working with Grow with Google at the August 4th employment event where 150
people applied for Census jobs. She hopes for similar success at the next event which
will be held on September 19th at the Google offices on Eighth Avenue between 6 and
8 pm. This event will help to get the 300,000 applicants needed to cover the New York
area. Flyers were made available.
Hearing: Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Preliminary Scoping for Draft
Environmental Impact Statement for Bus Terminal Redevelopment
No speakers came forward to speak. The matter was later discussed in connection
with the letter in Agenda Item 17.
Public Session
Tyrone Anthony Mr. Anthony is the president of the 300 West 46th Street Tenants Association. He voiced
his concerns about proposed renovations and tenant re-locations in his building. He
complained about a lack of outreach by the landlord that limits tenant involvement.
Doreen DeMusis Ms. DeMusis is also a tenant of 300 West 46th Street who is being re-located so that the
landlord can move a community room to the roof and put a restaurant in its place. She said
she is being moved to a fifth-floor studio apartment that will be difficult to reach because
the elevator will be out of service during renovations.
Libra Jiminez Another tenant of 300 West 46th Street, Ms. Jiminez, believes that tenants are being bullied
into re-locating for the purpose of installing another restaurant which, she believes, should
not be viewed as a true renovation.
Elsie Hidalgo Ms. Hidalgo is a resident in a Clinton Housing Development building. She identified
herself as the person who assists Spanish-speaking tenants in her building when dealing
with landlord and Section 8 issues.Jennifer Mallicote Ms. Mallicote lives at 300 West 21st Street and believes that conditions in her Chelsea
neighborhood have deteriorated recently due to increased homeless presence, aggressive
panhandling, drug dealing and prostitution. Her main concern has to do with the 24-hour
sex-related shops on Eighth Avenue that draw undesirable people to the neighborhood. She
also noted many shuttered businesses in the area and thinks that adds to the problem.
Ann Margret Ms. Warner introduced herself and her colleagues as Columbia journalism students who are
Warner covering community boards as part of their studies. Their focus so far has been on
healthcare, housing and transportation.
Pamela Wolff Ms. Wolff is a public member of the Board who spoke on her own behalf and the Council
of Chelsea Block Associations. Ms. Wolff voiced concerns like those of a previous speaker
about escalating public safety issues surrounding the stretch of Eighth Avenue between
20th and 22nd Streets. Specifically, over the past year, there has been more open drug
dealing and late-night prostitution activities. She noted that meetings with Speaker Johnson
and efforts by the 10th Precinct have recently improved conditions. She believes that the
presence of 5 wi-fi kiosks within a 2-block area have created an attractive nuisance and
would like to see three of them removed.
Wendy Gonzalez Ms. Gonzalez is a board member representing the West Side Community Fund. She
reminded everyone that the window for the Chelsea and Hudson Yards community
improvement grants is open but will close on the upcoming Friday.
Bobby Robaina Mr. Robaina works in the Office of Government Relations at the Fashion Institute of
Technology with Lisa Wager. He made the following announcements:
• Disney on Broadway continues its 25th-anniversary celebration in partnership with
FIT and has asked FIT Fashion Design students to reimagine contemporary designs
for some of its iconic female characters. The design challenge brought nearly 100
submissions, and 10 students were selected as finalists.
• The 10 finalists will have their garments on display in an exhibition at the Art and
Design Gallery at the corner of 27th Street and Seventh Avenue from Thursday,
September 19 – October 6.
• The reimagined gowns are for Jane from Tarzan, Rafiki and Nala from The Lion
King, Elsa and Anna from Frozen, Jasmine from Aladdin, Belle from Beauty and
the Beast, Ariel from The Little Mermaid, Katherine from Newsies, and Mary
Poppins.
• Three of the student finalists will be featured on Strahan and Sara (the last hour of
Good Morning, America) on September 12th.
• FIT’s special program for community members provides curator-led, one-hour
tours of the exhibitions at The Museum at FIT each Monday for those who rsvp at
Mondays-Friends@fitnyc.edu or by phone at (212) 217-4715.
Charlene Kaloki Ms. Kaloki is the new community coordinator at the Ryan-Chelsea Health Center. She
announced a back-to-school event for children on the upcoming Friday where backpacks
and school supplies will be given out. She also noted that exercise classes will continue to
be held on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays each week.
Inge Ivchenko Ms. Ivchenko is a Board member who spoke on behalf of the London Terrace 27th Annual
Street Fair that will be held on Saturday, September 21st from 10 am to 5 pm on West 24th
Street between 9th and 10th Avenues. The Fair features artists, craftspeople and vintage
clothing vendors and will have no commercial vendors.Remarks from Elected Officials and Representatives
State Senator The Senator introduced Maia Berlow as his new liaison to the Board. He continued with the
Brad Hoylman following comments:
• His office created a Parent and Family Resource Guide for public school children in
the City, which would be distributed the following day when schools open for the
new school year.
• The Child Victims Act went into effect on August 14th and since that date more
than 600 civil cases have been filed by victims of childhood sexual abuse against
their abusers.
• The Governor signed the Senator’s bill banning confessions of judgment on out-of-
state loans, thus invalidating legal documents signed by debtors in which they agree
to pay lenders a sum of money and forfeit their right to sue.
• The Senate and Assembly held a joint hearing on the recent Con Edison blackout in
which the president of Con Ed was questioned and urged to come forward with a
plan for redundancy to avoid similar blackouts.
• The Governor signed the Senator’s bill – co-sponsored by Dick Gottfried in the
Assembly – to ban floating digital billboards on the Hudson and East Rivers.
• The Senator and his Senate colleagues are holding a forum on the new rent laws at
the CUNY Graduate Center on September 10th at 6:30 pm.
Assemblymember Mr. Gottfried proudly noted the good working relationship shared by the elected officials
Dick Gottfried who represent our district. He made the following comments:
● He and other elected officials are forming a working group that includes community
stakeholders, CB4, and tenant leaders of the Fulton Houses and the Elliott-Chelsea
Houses to address the proposals put forth by NYCHA to address funding the capital
needs of those developments.
● In response to the Trump Administration’s new “gag rule” on abortion and
reproductive health services that bars funding for family planning under Title X, Mr.
Gottfried helped lead the effort to include money in the 2019 New York State
budget authorizing $16 million to support family planning providers in the event of
lost federal funding.
● He sponsored the 1977 law that first decriminalized the possession of small amounts
of marijuana, making possession of 25 grams a violation punishable by a fine.
However, the law had a provision that made the public display of marijuana a
misdemeanor. This did not affect the desired effect of the law for the first 25 years
of its existence. But in the 1990s the police made it a practice to coax young people
to empty their pockets in front of them, thereby triggering the public view provision.
This led to tens of thousands of misdemeanor arrests and convictions. Under New
York’s new marijuana law, there is no public view provision and the decriminalized
quantity level is now one ounce. Possession of up to two ounces is now a violation
with a penalty of up to $200. Most importantly, the new law automatically expunges
a person’s criminal record for past possession arrests and convictions for amounts
and offenses that are now decriminalized.
● He is taking part in a teach-in at the LGBT Community Center at 208 West 13th
Street at 6:30 pm to answer questions about his new bill to decriminalize sex work
in New York State.
● He and BP Gale Brewer will be holding a public forum at the Hartley House on
September 23rd at 6:30 pm to discuss his new single-payer bill, the New York
Health Act.
Assembly Ms. Rosenthal reviewed some of the legislation that she was involved with during the last
Member Linda Assembly session, including:
Rosenthal• The omnibus affordable housing legislation that includes bills to repeal vacancy
deregulation, reform rent control and eliminate the fuel pass along. A full summary
of the many bills in this legislation can be found at:
https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Linda-B-Rosenthal/story/87492 .
• The first-in-the-nation legislation that bans the declawing of cats.
• The Child Victims Act that provides a one-year lookback window. Ms. Rosenthal is
working on ways to help victims find pro bono legal representation in cases where a
money judgment is uncertain.
• A law that allows campaign funds to be used for childcare expenses while running
for office as well as when serving in public office in New York.
• The Securing Wages Earned Against Theft bill that helps employees recoup stolen
wages from their employers. The bill creates a new “employee’s lien” on an
employer’s property.
The Assemblymember will be holding a Census Job Fair on Friday, September 13th from 11
am to 2 pm at the Amsterdam Houses Community Room at 216 West 64th Street. She will
also be riding the M104 bus with NYC Transit President Andy Byford on Friday, September
6th starting at 10:07 am from the stop at 92nd Street and Broadway where passengers can
interact with Mr. Byford.
Brian Lewis for Mr. Lewis gave updates and made the following announcements:
BP Gale Brewer • The BP continues to work with the City and other elected officials to pause the
process of considering revenue generation at the Fulton Houses. Staff members
attended a tour given by NYCHA of the Ocean Bay development to monitor what
NYCHA is telling Fulton residents and what questions or concerns tenants are
expressing.
• The BP will give testimony tomorrow at a public meeting on the Port Authority Bus
Terminal replacement at the Times Square Westin Hotel. Public testimony can be
given at 4:30 and 6 pm.
• The BP partnered with CB4 to flyer Fulton Houses regarding the 2020 Census
Employment event hosted by Google in August.
• The Trump administration’s “Public Charge” rule will go into effect on October 15.
Implementation of the rule will hinder the ability of undocumented immigrants
receiving public benefits from attaining legal permanent status. At 6:00 pm on
September 5, the office will host an informative town hall to discuss the rule at
Synod House of The Cathedral of St. John the Devine. The staff will also be
handing out flyers before the first day of class at several public schools.
• There will be several charter revision proposals on the November ballot, including
the establishment of ranked-choice voting, the restructure of the CCRB, and
changes to ULURP. A public meeting to discuss these proposals will be held on
September 16 and October 17 at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.
• Claims for food lost during the Con Edison blackout can still be filed for
reimbursement of costs up to $515 for residents. Claims must include an itemized
list and proof of loss (e.g. receipts, canceled checks, or photos of spoiled food.)
• Borough Presidents can now subsidize fees paid by community groups when they
use public facilities and are able to prove a hardship paying such fees.
• This year marks the 50th anniversary of the African American Parade. The BP will
host a pre-parade reception at the Adam Clayton Powell State Building on
September 13.
Robert Atterbury Mr. Atterbury reviewed key legislation that the Congressman is working on in the House
For Congressman Judiciary Committee, along with other matters of interest:
Jerry Nadler • Two gun control measures – the Make America Safe Act, which bans high capacity
ammunition magazines, and the Extreme Risk Protection Order Act, which prevents
those deemed a risk to themselves or others from accessing firearms.• There will be a public hearing on September 25 on protecting America from assault
weapons.
• Over the Summer, the Judiciary Committee served subpoenas on Trump
Administration figures Rob Porter, Corey Lewandowski and Rick Dearborn in
relation to information contained in the report of Special Counsel Rob Mueller. The
Committee also asked a federal judge to expedite the testimony of White House
Counsel Don McGahn. There was also a request to the National Archives for
documents sought during the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh that were
denied to the Committee.
• In July, the MORE Act of 2019 was introduced into Congress as the first federal
legislation to decriminalize and de-schedule marijuana.
• The Raise the Wage Act that the Congressman co-sponsored was passed by the
House; it will gradually increase the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour by
2025.
Carl Wilson for Mr. Wilson made the following announcements:
Speaker Corey • The office is partnering with City agencies to host a recycling event at Mathews-
Johnson Palmer Playground in Hell’s Kitchen on Sunday, October 6 from 1 to 4 pm.
• He noted that there were idea submission cards at the back of the room that
attendees could use to provide input for the Participatory Budgeting Program.
• There are a few weeks left in the Food Bag Program for Seniors that the Speaker
and BP Brewer have organized.
Luke Wolf for Mr. Wolf made his first appearance before the Board as Scott Springer’s new liaison. He
Comptroller made the following announcements:
Scott Springer • The Comptroller unveiled the NYC Under 3 plan to deliver the single largest local
investment in childcare in the country for families with children under age 3 and
bringing costs down to zero for families who need support the most.
• Research has revealed that 41 percent of all teachers hired in the 2012-13 school
year left within five years. To combat a further exodus of teachers, the Comptroller
has proposed the largest teacher residency program in America. The plan establishes
a year-long, paid, classroom residency program to train 1,000 new teachers each
year.
• The Comptroller’s analysis found that internet disparities are pervasive throughout
New York City. Across the five boroughs, 29 percent of households lack broadband
internet access. Internet disparities are most apparent in underserved communities.
With billions in federal aid at stake, New York City’s digital divide threatens an
undercount of vulnerable populations in the first-ever digital Census in 2020. The
Comptroller urges comprehensive outreach to support the Census and demands that
the Census Bureau provide paper forms to NYC communities at risk of an
undercount.

District Manager
October 2019 Full Board Meeting Minutes
The meeting began with the public session, as there were no presentations or public
PRESENTATIONS /
hearings this month.
PUBLIC HEARINGS
Public Session
Tyrone Anthony Mr. Anthony is the president of the 300 West 46th Street Tenants Association. Following
up on the comments that he made at last month’s board meeting, he complained that the
management staff of his building has not engaged the senior and disabled residents to
discuss the impact of ongoing renovations.
Doreen DeMusis Ms. DeMusis is also a tenant of 300 West 46th Street who is being re-located during
renovations. She stated that the new building manager called to ask that she meet to discuss
her re-location plan and that she refused because she did not believe she would be offered
anything satisfactory. She had requested earlier that she be given a studio apartment on the
first floor because of a proposed elevator shut down but was not given a reply.
William Beer Mr. Beer lives on West 16th Street between 9th and 10th Avenues. He complained of
deteriorating conditions in his neighborhood due to traffic, construction and noise. He
presented a list of seven items of concern that he wishes to distribute to businesses in the
neighborhood and asked the Board members for help in doing so.
Linda Ocasio Ms. Ocasio, a resident of 419 West 17th Street, spoke in opposition to proposed demolition
at the Fulton Houses and the RAD program. She mentioned the NYCHA-sponsored tour of
a RAD development at Ocean Bay that she attended with other residents. In her opinion,
the conditions there are oppressive for the stringent security measures that have been
adopted, among other things. She wants the City to find the money to do repairs at Fulton
Houses rather than go through with its RAD proposal.
Daniel Ramirez Mr. Ramirez gave a speech in Spanish denouncing the plans for Fulton Houses.
Jennifer Mallicote Ms. Mallicote, who lives at 300 West 21st Street, reiterated the concerns she voiced last
month about the public safety issues in her neighborhood. She pointed to an increased
homeless presence, aggressive panhandling, drug dealing and prostitution. She also stated
that the amount of theft and violence that occurs can be directly correlated to the number of
sex-related businesses nearby. She wants the support of CB4 in her effort to get the City to
enforce existing regulations that restrict the number of such businesses within 500 feet of
schools and religious institutions.Pamela Wolff Ms. Wolff, a public member of the Board’s Chelsea Land Use Committee, spoke on her
own behalf with respect to the same issues raised by the previous public speaker. She
focused on the stretch of Eighth Avenue between 20th and 22nd Streets where the existence
of too many wi-fi kiosks appears to enable bad behavior. Ms. Wolff also spoke in favor of
Agenda Items 5, 6 and 7 which she voted for in committee but would not be authorized to
vote on at this meeting.
Bobby Robaina Mr. Robaina works in the Office of Government Relations at the Fashion Institute of
Technology. He made the following announcements:
• FIT received a grant from the National Science Foundation in the amount of nearly
$187,000 to help further the college’s goal of developing innovative ideas at the
intersection of design, technology, and science. The funds will be used to purchase
an electron microscope to aid on-campus research and improve undergraduate
science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics education.
• Fourth-year Fashion Design student Hannah Myers won the Paraiso UpCycle
Challenge this summer. The competition asked students to raise awareness of
sustainability by upcycling deadstock fabric from international swimwear designers
and using it to create their own swimwear designs. Upcycling, also known as
creative reuse, transforms by-products and waste materials into products of better
quality and environmental value. Ms. Myers chose to demonstrate the impact of
pollution through her two swimwear designs, which incorporated fishing net
imagery and its negative effect on sea creatures.
Dierdre Carson Ms. Carson, from the law firm Greenberg Traurig, spoke on behalf of her client David
Lesser who owns 418 West 20th Street, which is the subject of Agenda Item 6 – the letter
to the LPC that came out of the CLU Committee. She objected to portions of the letter in
the belief that they are factually erroneous or misrepresentations of the intentions of the
presenter at the CLU meeting. After her legal argument in favor of the LPC application, she
asked the Board to disregard the recommendation contained in the letter.
Peter Nezey Mr. Nezey also spoke on behalf of the owner of 418 West 20th Street, focusing on what he
believes is the CLU Committee’s misapplication of a “restoration” standard instead of an
“appropriateness” standard in evaluating his LPC application and thus arriving at an
incorrect conclusion.
Bob Liff Mr. Liff is a neighbor of Mr. Lesser on West 20th Street who, along with another neighbor
at 412 West 20th Street whose letter he read from, supports the LPC application under
discussion. They believe that denying changes sought in the application would be of harm
to the long-term protection and preservation of their buildings.
Marni Halasa Ms. Halasa is a member of the advocacy group Fight for NYCHA that is working to find
ways to fully fund NYCHA developments. She wants the Board to oppose any plans for the
privatization of NYCHA, including demolition, RAD programs, rezoning, air rights sales,
and NYCHA infill development.
Timothy Harrell Mr. Harrell is the Outreach Coordinator for the NYC Civilian Complaint Review Board.
He urged people to call the CCRB if they are aware of police misconduct. He announced a
town hall that will be held at the Grand Street Settlement located at 80 Pitt Street on
November 13th from 6:30 to 8 pm.
Remarks from Elected Officials and RepresentativesBorough Ms. Brewer presented recent updates on her activities:
President Gale • Now that the Mayor’s Office has agreed to pause its plans for Fulton Houses and
Brewer join the Fulton Houses Working Group, it is understood that no further actions will
be taken until all options have been considered in formulating strategies for
generating funds for needed repairs.
• The office has been hard at work on preparations for the 2020 Census and the BP is
especially thankful that Google has taken an interest by making its facilities
available for census worker recruitment events – three so far – that have resulted in
a significant number of applications.
• Staff member Brian Lewis has been working with CB4 on the quality of life issues
that have recently plagued Chelsea.
• The BP thanked CB4 again for its work on the Port Authority Bus Terminal
replacement.
• The Manhattan Paper Challenge has been underway for three months and has been
increasing awareness of the importance of recycling in homes and businesses.
• To address the challenges facing religious institutions in the Borough when they are
approached by real estate developers, the BP convened a Religious Facilities Task
Force to help these organizations’ leaders learn how to repurpose, preserve, or
redevelop their properties for maximum community benefit. The first public
meeting where affected communities can express their views will be held at the
Borough Office on Monday, November 25 from 6 to 8 pm.
• The BP has a new initiative to make the borough more age-friendly. The kickoff
event will take place at John Jay College on Sunday, October 27 from 12 to 3 pm.
• The BP is co-sponsoring the Reduce, Reuse, Repair, Recycle Fair hosted by the
Manhattan Solid Waste Advisory Board. Sunday, October 6, 1:00 – 4:00 pm at the
Mathews-Palmer Playground, 445 W. 45th Street.
• The retail vacancy bill that the BP co-sponsored in the City Council has passed,
making it necessary for retail property owners to have their properties listed in a
database for tracking purposes.
• Ms. Brewer briefly reviewed the five ballot proposals to change the City Charter
that will be voted on in November. Flyers were made available.
Assemblymember Ms. Rosenthal made the following comments:
Linda B. • She passed most of the legislation regarding electronic cigarettes and, even though
Rosenthal the City has its own legislation banning the flavored variety, she believes there is a
need for state law as well. Most recently, she introduced a bill fashioned on the one
passed in San Francisco that bans the sale of all e-cigarettes until such time as the
F.D.A. declares them safe tobacco cessation devices.
• She noted that a federal judge in Philadelphia had just ruled that so-called safe
injection sites do not violate federal law. These are places where people bring their
own pre-obtained drugs to a safe, sterile environment that is overseen by medical
staff. This clears the path for the same thing in New York. The City Council
determined in a past study that it should be allowed. She has had a bill in New York
for several years and is hoping the State Department of Health will review it.
• There was a public hearing on campaign finance reform where Ms. Rosenthal
testified in favor of reform and the need for a robust law that also allows for
everyone to participate.
• Annual flu shot day will be held at her district office at 230 West 72nd Street on
October 7 from 10 am – 1 pm. Those who are interested should call for an
appointment.
Matt Tighe for Mr. Tighe gave the following updates:
Assemblymember • The Fulton Houses Working Group will be meeting on a weekly basis and to inform
Dick Gottfried their work there will be bi-weekly public engagement sessions. All work on theFulton Houses project in the Mayor’s office has come to a halt and all RFP dates
have been stricken from the calendar.
• On September 5, Mr. Gottfried testified on his own behalf and for other elected
officials at a scoping session for the new Port Authority Bus Terminal. He
recommended that the new terminal be built in-place on the existing site, adding
new levels to the bus terminal, making room for commuter and tourist buses, and
holding the Port Authority to its promise not to use eminent domain on other
properties in Hell’s Kitchen.
• Mr. Gottfried introduced a bill in the Assembly to make all two- and four-year
SUNY and CUNY institutions and public community colleges free of tuition and
fees for New York residents who agree to reside in the state for five years
subsequent to graduation.
• On October 28, Mr. Gottfried will hold a public information session on the newly
enacted rent laws at which lawyers from the Legal Aid Society will discuss the new
laws and answer questions. It will be held at Hartley House at 413 West 46th Street
at 6 pm.
• The Governor just signed legislation that was passed last year to extend the date to
register to vote in the November primary from October 11 to February 14.
Congressman Mr. Nadler noted the formation of the Fulton Houses Working Group and that it now
Jerry Nadler includes the Mayor’s office. The Mayor has agreed to begin the planning process all over
again. Mr. Nadler reaffirmed his opposition to demolition in any circumstances.
He went on to mention that half the bills that have been passed in the House this session
have come out of the Judiciary Committee which he chairs. One bill that was recently
reported out of the Committee is the FAIR Act, which ends forced arbitration between
merchants and consumers. If enacted, it will level the playing field in consumer transactions
for the first time in decades. It would restore the rights of employees and consumers to the
court system, while still enabling the voluntary use of private arbitration.
Another bill that was reported out of the Judiciary Committee with bipartisan support is the
Copyright Alternative in Small-Claims Enforcement Act of 2019. It is expected to be passed
in the House and would establish a voluntary small claims court within the Copyright Office
to hear copyright suits seeking $30,000 or less in total damages. Its purpose is to provide a
forum wherein it is economically feasible for independent creators such as songwriters or
visual artists to protect their rights against copyright infringement and have damages
assessed without having to pay for legal representation.
Mr. Nadler provided a summary of the most important issues facing Congress vis-à-vis the
Trump Administration’s refusal to comply with subpoenas, the President’s actions in
seeking help from Ukraine for political purposes, and the hearings related to the
impeachment inquiry.
Kevin Jean Mr. Jean Baptiste made two brief announcements:
Baptiste for D.A. • The Manhattan District Attorney’s Office expanded its Saturday Night Lights
Cyrus Vance program out of Manhattan into 20 gyms across the City. The program is the D.A.’s
signature youth-development and violence prevention program.
• The Office has stopped prosecuting all 16- and 17-year-old defendants as adults.
Their cases are now handled in Family Court with the D.A.’s Office continuing to
assist with resources such as programming.
Taylor Ms. Abbruzzese gave the following updates:
Abbruzzese for • The Congresswoman spoke at a press conference alongside Rep. Nydia Velazquez
Congresswoman and other members of congress on the Public Housing Emergency Response Act
Carolyn Maloney that was introduced by Rep. Velazquez the previous week. The legislation would
provide $70 billion public housing nationally, with $32 billion going to NYCHA.• This summer, the final version of the 911 Victims Compensation Act became law.
• In late August, Ms. Maloney hosted a gun safety town hall to discuss legislation she
is working on to address the Country’s growing gun violence epidemic. She called
on the Senate to take up the House bills H8 and H1112 that would require universal
background checks and close the gun show loophole.
• Through her work on the Financials Services Committee she introduced the
Financial Services Transparency Act. She has also introduced two bills that would
relieve tax burdens on American citizens living overseas.
• As a longtime defender of women, Ms. Maloney authored the Debbie Smith Act in
20004 to end the backlog of unanalyzed DNA evidence taken from rape kits. She is
now working on having the Act reauthorized. She also introduced legislation to
create a Women’s History Museum on the National Mall; the bill now has 292
bipartisan co-sponsors.
• The Congresswoman is excited to learn that the impeachment inquiry of the
President that she called for in June is now open.

There was a meeting with the Port Authority that members of the Bus Terminal
Board Chair Report Working Group attended on September 9th. This informational meeting did not
meet our expectations because of a lack of interest on the part of the Port Authority
in creating additional park space near the terminal. Their reasoning was based on
cost numbers that did not comport with reality. The next meeting will include
representatives of our elected officials as well as members of CB5.

PRESENTATIONS /
Manhattan Community Board 4 Statement of District Needs and Budget Priorities for
PUBLIC HEARINGS
Fiscal Year 2021
Second Vice Chair Jeffrey LeFrancois, Chair of the Budget Task Force, offered a
summary of his presentation before proceeding to discuss the following:
• An overview of the Budget Task Force functions and responsibility
• Fiscal Year 2020 successes
• Statement of District Needs
• Requests for Fiscal Year 2021
• Next steps
The work product of the Budget Task Force is contained in the Statement that is the
subject of Agenda Item 31. It must be passed by a vote of the Board before being sent
to the Department of City Planning.
Public Hearing:
The following people spoke during the public hearing:
• Christina Perry, the Director of Outreach for Chain Theatre on West 36th
Street, wants an exemption from paying property taxes on its building that
houses six nonprofit theatres. She is requesting funds to hire a government
expert to explore the means for pursuing the exemption.
• Ginny Louloudes, Executive Director of the Alliance of Public Theatres,
explained the reasons for the Chain Theatre tax exemption and the
justifications for it.
• Porter Pickard of the York Theatre Company that is housed in the Chain
Theatre building noted the benefits that his organization would gain from a tax
exemption.
• Meghan Finn, the Artistic Director of The Tank, located on the first floor of
the West 36th Street building, described her work with emerging artists whose
works are performed at the venue and the opportunities that free space affords
them. A tax exemption makes continued free space possible.
• Randi Berry, the Executive Director of Indie Space, is an advisor on the Chain
Theatre project, and, also has its own budget request included in CB4’s
package. Her organization offers free advisory and consulting services to
artists facing a real estate challenge, transition or opportunity.Mr. LeFrancois thanked the speakers and indicated that their concerns should be
brought before the Arts, Culture, Education & Street Life Committee so that they can
be taken up by the Board for inclusion in next year’s budget considerations. Other
members added that it might be more appropriate to address the tax exemption outside
of the budget process.
Public Session
Joli Golden Ms. Golden of the U.S. Census Bureau noted that the 2020 Census was going to begin in a
mere 144 days with the database opening on March 12th followed by Census Day on April
1st. She stressed that the Census Bureau was continuing to recruit in Lower Manhattan
because there were only 2,700 current applicants for that area and 7,000 more are needed.
And because recruitment is done locally, she asked CB4 to increase its help by distributing
cards and flyers in the neighborhoods in the district.
Dan Sheldon Mr. Sheldon represents the tenants of 150 West 26th Street in its efforts to prevent the
issuance of a liquor license to the applicant in Agenda Item 8. Their primary objection is
that there are already 12 licensed establishments within 500 feet of the premises, 8 of which
are on their block. The bar would be located on the ground floor of a 25-unit residential
building where 24 units have signed a petition against the proposed license. The block is
saturated with bars and restaurants, one of which has been a constant source of trouble.
Jennifer Mallicote Ms. Mallicote is a frequent speaker at CB4 meetings where she tells of incidents in her
neighborhood along the stretch of Eighth Avenue between 21st and 22nd Streets. This time
she mentioned three violent incidents involving a slashing, shooting, and a robbery, along
with a mysterious case of a person who was found dead on the street. She has worked with
the NYPD but still sees conditions worsening.
Marni Halasa Ms. Halasa is a member of the advocacy group Fight for NYCHA that has been working
city-wide with residents to oppose RAD being adopted in NYCHA developments. She
complained of being shut out of a meeting of the Mayor’s working group, even though she
had been promised a role earlier in the Summer by Borough President Brewer. She said
other interest groups and stakeholders were shut out as well. She went on to state her belief
that the working group is a sham and that it has violated the state Open Meetings Law. Her
group has filed a complaint with the U.S. Attorney’s Office.
Curley Santos Ms. Santos is a community leader from the Elliott Chelsea Houses who also complained of
being shut out of the Mayor’s NYCHA working group. She asserted the claim that the
meeting was a public meeting subject to the Open Meetings Law and that, as a member of
the public who lives in public housing, she had a right to attend the meeting.
Doris Bachman Ms. Bachman lives at West 46th Street and 10th Avenue. She complained about large
amounts of litter on the sidewalks in her area and thinks the solution would be to install
three trash cans for garbage, recycling, and food and compost. She also wants people to use
different color bags to separate cans and bottles for the people who collect them privately
for redemption. Ms. Bachman also complained about the shortage of M11 buses on Tenth
Avenue.
Sean Reilley Mr. Reilly is a researcher for the Service Workers International Union Local 32 BJ. The
union represents janitors, security workers, airport workers, apartment workers, and others.
There are 85,000 members in New York City – one in every 100 adult workers – with
3,300 members who either live or work in MCB4. Over the past year, the union has been
collaborating with Chipotle workers to better their working conditions. Mr. Reilly came to
the meeting to raise issues relating to practices in five Chipotle liquor license holders in
MCB4. He claims that the company violates fair scheduling and minimum wage laws and,more importantly, requires underage workers to mix and serve alcoholic beverages. He
wants CB4 to oppose the renewal of Chipotle’s liquor licenses because of this.
Lisa Wager Ms. Wager is the director of the Office of Government Relations at the Fashion Institute of
Technology. She made the following announcements:
• ChalkFIT was first organized in 2013 by Professor of Illustration Dan Shefelman.
As part of their curriculum, Illustration students create a temporary mural on FIT’s
façade. This year, the mural has doubled in size to 82 panels and stretches along
Seventh Avenue from 26th to 28th Street. This year, the theme is FIT’s 75th
anniversary and are of iconic moments in FIT’s history and going forward. Eighty-
four students used non-toxic, water-soluble chalk mixed with water to create bold,
colorful murals. Blick Art Materials donated $1,000 worth of supplies for the
project. The murals will be on the facades for several months.
• Yoko Katagi, assistant professor of Social Sciences and a breast cancer survivor, is
working with Sidney Nobleza – who graduated last year with a bachelor’s degree
in Technical Design – to manufacture and market a garment for post-op
mastectomy patients to be worn both in the hospital and after they’ve been
released.
Alex Wolaver Mr. Wolaver represents the 350 West 51st Street Tenants Association in its efforts to
combat the problems in the neighborhood caused by the residents of Stardom Hall, a
supportive housing facility run by the Lantern Organization at 330 West 51st Street. He
believes the facility poses a danger to the community because of numerous instances of
violence against outsiders and staff and the inability of staff members to curtail such
violence. He recited numerous instances of criminal activity over the past two years that
have left members of the community in a state of fear. And while his Association is in
favor of providing assistance to people like the residents of Stardom Hall, he believes that
Lantern does not fulfill its duty to provide mental health support and supervision of its
residents. He listed the many changes that he wants Lantern to make in its operation.
Julia Knight Ms. Knight is the director of Poster House, located at 119 West 23rd Street, that opened in
June. It is a museum dedicated solely to posters from all over the world. The museum will
be offering more free events, including one on November 11th for military veterans. It is
also working to provide at least one free community day for each exhibition cycle. The next
one is on Saturday, November 23rd.
Remarks from Elected Officials and Representatives
Assemblymember The Assemblymember made the following comments:
Dick Gottfried • He spoke about the Chelsea NYCHA Working Group – what gave rise to its
creation and the most recent meetings that have been held to deal with the proposal
to fund the NYCHA complexes in the district and the use of private management.
He was happy to note that the Mayor has agreed to halt any action on his proposal
that would lead to the demolition of buildings at the Fulton Houses. He stated that
the Working Group would be holding public meetings to gather community input
and that there should be some conclusions by the end of the year.
• He mentioned the fact that, for the first time since the 1930s, New York now has a
Democratic Legislature and Governor. This has led to the passage of a great deal of
legislation, including environmental legislation. The environmental advocacy group
known as Environmental Advocates keeps a score rating for members of the
legislature in New York. Mr. Gottfried and some of his colleagues were given ascore of 100 by the group, with the Assemblymember being labeled an
“Environmental Champion.”
Brian Lewis for Mr. Lewis provided the following updates and announcements on behalf of the Manhattan
Borough Borough President:
President Gale • The BP has been active in the Chelsea NYCHA Working Group, having attended its
Brewer two most recent meetings. She looks forward to a thorough investigation of all
possible options to meet the needs of Chelsea’s NYCHA complexes. In response to
an earlier statement by a member of Fight for NYCHA, Mr. Lewis confirmed that
Ms. Brewer had indeed recently appointed a resident of Fulton Houses who is a
member of that group to the Working Group and the speaker might not be aware of
it.
• The BP has also been active in the Chelsea Quality of Life/Public Safety Working
Group and has been closely following the public meetings held by Speaker Johnson.
She is aware of the concerns related to the LinkNYC kiosks on Eighth Avenue and
looks forward to working on those concerns with Speaker Johnson’s office.
• The BP is working with the Garment District Alliance to allocate $2.5 million to
programs that will support garment manufacturers in the district because she knows
the importance of taking steps to ensure that garment manufacturers remain in the
Garment District.
• The Community Board application process will begin earlier this year than last with
the BP’s website going live at the end of this week or next week. The application
itself has been tweaked in a way to make it easier to complete. Members should
check to see whether it is time to re-apply.
• There have been recent concerns about community boards that have more than 25%
of its members employed by the City. The BP will not remove anyone during their
term if their board’s membership rises above the 25% limit. Instead, during
appointment time, efforts will be made to reduce the City employee percentage
below 25% by making necessary adjustments.
• The BP has commissioned a comprehensive study of residential parking plans in
seven cities worldwide. This was done in contemplation of congestion pricing to get
an idea of what parking schemes work best.
• The BP’s Budget unit is holding four informational workshops for Manhattan’s
public schools and not-for-profits. One for public schools was for tonight and the
other on the 13th from 4 – 6 pm. One for not-for-profits will be held on the 14th
from 4 – 6 pm. All meetings are at 1 Centre Street.
• The Religious Facilities Task Force is holding a public hearing to get community
input on strategies that would support the longevity of religious congregations while
upholding historic preservation and the economic and cultural vitality of
neighborhoods. The hearing will take place at 1 Centre Street on Monday,
November 25th from 6 – 8 pm. It will also be streamed live on the BP’s Facebook
page.
Robert Atterbury The Congressman joined with other local electeds to ban non-essential helicopter use in the
for Congressman City and made sure that the Hudson River was part of the legislation. The bill does not cover
Jerry Nadler drones, as they are governed by separate statutes.
He also joined Rep. Velazquez in a bill to appropriate $70 billion in capital funding to
public housing nationwide, $32 billion of which would be designated for NYCHA. The
large portion going to NYCHA reflects its massive size compared to other housing
authorities in the nation.
Last week the House approved specific procedures that would be used in the impeachment
proceeding now underway in Washington. Those resolutions lay out what would be
regarded regular order in the four separate committees now considering their own lists ofarticles of impeachment. They also set out the procedures to be used on the House floor after
the final preparation of articles by the Judiciary Committee, if deemed called for by the
Committee.
Maia Berlow for The Senator recently introduced the Adult Survivors Act which opens a one-year window
State Senator giving people over the age of eighteen the right to file a civil suit against their sexual
Brad Hoylman abusers. This legislation would cover people like Harvey Weinstein and Jeffrey Epstein.
In response to a request from Local 32 BJ, the Senator has written a letter to the SLA
opposing the renewal of Chipotle’s liquor licenses because of their violations of worker’s
rights.
The Governor signed into law a bill that Mr. Hoylman co-sponsored with Assemblymember
Glick that requires the SLA to create and maintain a public database of information related
to on-premises liquor licenses.
Erica Overton for Ms. Rosenthal is hosting her annual mammogram event on Monday, November 25th from
Assemblymember 1:30 – 4:00 pm. Those who are interested in having the procedure should call the office for
Linda B. an appointment.
Rosenthal
The Assemblymember has been working on e-cigarettes for over a decade and has recently
introduced five new bills against e-cigs: the first one would place a moratorium on the sale
of e-cigarettes until the F.D.A. has deemed them safe; another would prohibit the use of
toxic metals and a disclosure of materials in the vaping product and the hardware used to
smoke it.
In response to a threat by the Trump Administration to cut SNAP benefits to recipients
around the country, Ms. Rosenthal submitted testimony against such action. The proposed
guidelines would limit income to $16,000 per year and would affect about 230,000 people in
New York.
Carl Wilson for The Council last week passed the Streets Master Plan to improve safety and street use by
Speaker Corey adding 50 miles of new bike lanes, 30 miles of bus lanes, more pedestrian plazas, and other
Johnson design innovations.
During the past month, the Speaker’s office was involved in several quality-of-life meetings
dealing with drug issues, homelessness and public safety. He is focused now on finding
legislative solutions to combat some of those problems, including altering the functionality
of LinkNYC kiosks in the district.
The TIL Program buildings at 201-207 Seventh Avenue are now vacant so the developer,
Asian Americans for Equality, and HPD can begin environmental tests. A nine-month pre-
demolition process is expected, with completion sometime in late 2020.
A Medicare enrollment event will take place tomorrow at the Hudson Guild on West 26th
Street from 1:00 – 2:00 pm.
Luke Wolf for Mr. Wolf highlighted two reports that were recently released by the Comptroller:
Comptroller • The Creative Economy Report provides an up-to-date look at the City’s creative
Scott Stringer economy. The creative sector, as defined in the Report, “ includes any industry the
primary output of which is creative or cultural – from museums and art galleries, to
film and television production, theater and dance companies, fashion, publishing,
advertising, and more.” The creative sector employees 293,000 people and, in 2017
paid $30 billion in total wages. The sector accounts for 13% of the City’s economic
output with $110 billion in economic activity that can be traced directly or indirectly
to it. The Report can be downloaded at https://comptroller.nyc.gov/reports/the-
creative-economy/• The Retail Vacancy Report addresses concerns about retail that has grown since the
time of the Great Recession of 2008-2009. Data from multiple sources used to
create the report reveal that retail vacancy rates have risen by 50% over the past
decade. In the Hell’s Kitchen/Clinton area the rate is 8.6% compared to 5.8%
citywide. There are three major causes for this increase: 1) the rise of Amazon and
internet shopping; 2) higher rents; and 3) City regulations that make it onerous to
move into a newly vacant space.
The Report offers three recommendations to reduce the vacancy rate: 1) the City
should provide tax incentives to businesses that move into high-vacancy areas; 2)
there should be a more streamlined path for businesses seeking regulatory action
that would include a single-point-of-contact customer service; and, 3) retail vacancy
and the future of retail in a district should be much more ingrained in the city
planning process so that the community is aware and can move forward over the
coming years and decades to prevent temporary high vacancy rates from becoming
permanent. The Report can be downloaded at
https://comptroller.nyc.gov/reports/retail-vacancy-in-new-york-city/

Metro Baptist Church.
The Fund for the City of New York granted funds to CB4 that made it possible to
hire three new planning fellows for the coming year – 2 from Columbia and 1 from
Pratt. They will be working with the Chelsea Land Use Committee, the Port

December 2019 Full Board Meeting Minutes
Hearing: Application to the Board of Standard and Appeals for a Physical Culture
Establishment at 155 West 23rd Street - Solidcore
PRESENTATIONS /
PUBLIC HEARINGS
Betty Mackintosh, co-chair of the Chelsea Land Use Committee, described the
application. No public speakers came forward and the hearing was closed.
Public Session
Sophia Laskaris Ms. Laskaris stated that her family comes from a long line of street vendors, with her
parents arriving in the 1950s and being able to buy a home and send three children to
college with their earnings from vending. Street vending has always been a path for the
City’s diverse group of new arrivals to earn a living and become productive members of
society. But now, they have been hindered in their efforts by constant police harassment,
excessive fines by the Health Department, and by obstacles created by business owners.
Sonia Perez Ms. Perez presented her personal story in Spanish with the help of an interpreter. She has
worked for many years assisting street vendors in their quest to get Intro 1116 passed by
the City Council. And, although 29 members of the Council support the law, Speaker
Johnson has not put it up for a vote. Ms. Perez noted that the current street vendor laws
have been in effect since the 1980s and need to be changed to allow for more vendor
permits.
Mohamed E- Mr. E-Sherif has been a vendor for ten years and has operated a food cart on West 34th
Sherif Street since 2014, before the completion of the 7 Train and Hudson Yards. His presence
was welcomed during the construction phase of Hudson Yards, but that changed when the
project was completed. He complained of being a constant target of health inspectors, the
NYPD and the Parks Department inspectors who have the common goal of removing his
food cart from its current location. He recalled a day when 22 inspectors showed up
together and 15 minutes later left without finding any violations. He is from one of 25
families that operate 8 food trucks; every one of them has had similar problems.
Nazih Attia Mr. Attia also operates a food cart in Hudson Yards. He complained of being harassed by a
building owner who placed planters in his regular location, forcing him to move.
Juan Salas Mr. Salas is disabled and has worked as a street vendor for 15 years with a license but has
been unable to obtain a permit.
Heleodora Vivar- Ms. Flores spoke about vendor issues in Spanish with the aid of an interpreter. She too has
Flores worked for many years as a license-holder lacking a permit. She requested the Board’s
support in having Speaker Johnson put Intro 1116 up for a vote. Working without a permit
puts her at risk of arrest and having her property confiscated.Sari Kisilevsky Ms. Kisilevsky is an associate professor at Queens College CUNY who has been working
with the Street Vendors Project. She argued against the notions that street vendors add to
street congestion and draw business away from small businesses. She asserted that vendors
usually set up in natural alcoves away from sidewalk traffic and add foot traffic in
underserved areas, which benefits small businesses. She stated that there is no evidence that
vendors actually compete with brick and mortar stores; the evidence seems to suggest an
opposite reality where vendors are complimentary to small businesses.
Elrana Jaramillo Ms. Jaramillo, a resident of Washington Heights, was aided by an interpreter in requesting
support from the Board with respect to the passage of Intro 1116. She noted that Speaker
Johnson gave his support to bicycle delivery workers but withheld his support for street
vendors even though they come from the same class of low-income immigrant workers.
She believes that the vendor permit system needs to be reformed since the number of
allowable permits has been frozen for more than 30 years.
Emily Rosenzweig Ms. Rosenzweig is a staff member of the Street Vendor Project, a coalition with more than
2,000 vendor members in the City who are working to secure fair working conditions for
street vendors. All of the previous speakers are members of SVP. The group has been
fighting for permits for many years and almost got a bill passed in 2016. The current bill –
1116-A – has majority support in the Council and only needs Speaker Johnson’s action to
be passed into law. The current cap on vendor permits has been in effect since 1983
resulting in long waiting lists that can last for as long as 20 years. One provision of 1116
would gradually increase the number of food vending permits available, adding 445 new
permits per year over a period of ten years. There are about 20,000 people on the waiting
list now. The SVP is asking CB4 to pass a resolution in support of 1116.
Josephine Ishman Ms. Ishman, a public member of the Board, announced a public meeting of the ACES
Committee along with Community Boards 1 and 2 to conduct a panel discussion on
students with learning disabilities. It will be held on Monday, December 9 at the Quest to
Learn Middle School, located at 351 West 18th Street, from 6:30 – 8:30 pm.
Michael Mr. Prichinello of Renn Sport Union announced an event that it will co-sponsor with the
Prichinello Classic Car Club on December 14 from 10 am – 1 pm at Pier 76 at Hudson River Park.
Maia Berlow Ms. Berlow is Senator Brad Hoylman’s community liaison to CB4 who announced a public
conversation with the Senator and NYS Attorney General Tish James to discuss New
York’s progressive future. It will be held on December 16 from 6:30 – 7:30 pm at the
CUNY Graduate Center, 365 Fifth Avenue.
Miriam Fisher Ms. Fisher represents the Elevator Action Group which advocates for making subways
100% accessible with the inclusion of elevators, escalators, and ramps for people with
disabilities and others who need them to access the subway system. There is a plan that has
the support of the Governor and Speaker Johnson, but she fears that there is no meaningful
provision for funding at the MTA. She asked that people participate at her rallies and send
postcards to the Governor. She provided postcards that were pre-addressed and stamped for
that purpose.
Bobby Robaina Mr. Robaina works in the Office of Government Relations at the Fashion Institute of
Technology. He made the following announcements:
• A new exhibition is opening at the Museum at FIT on December 10. Power Mode:
The Force of Fashion will explore the multiple roles fashion plays in challenging
power dynamics within society. The show will feature 50 objects from the
museum’s permanent collection, many of which have never before been on public
view.
• Fashion-Schools.org has named FIT the number one college for fashion design and
fashion merchandising in its 2019 rankings.Tom Mullaney Mr. Mullaney is a resident of West 26th Street near the Ainsworth Bar which has been a
longstanding problem in the neighborhood. He stated that the bar had been raided the night
before and shut down for underage drinking and operating as a nightclub without a license.
Multiple arrests were made as well. It reopened the following day.
Joni Bokser Mr. Bokser, who is a member of the Board, made an announcement on his own behalf
regarding an event that will be held at FIT on December 10 from 6:30 – 7:30 pm. The New
York State Governor’s Office of Motion Picture and Television Development, FIT,
and The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel will host a conversation with award-winning American
costume designer Donna Zakowska.
Marni Halasa Ms. Halasa is a member of the community group Community Control of Land Use New
York. The group supports the Small Business Jobs Survival Act in the City Council and is
pushing Speaker Johnson to hold the public hearing to debate it that he promised. The bill
gives commercial tenants a minimum 10-year lease at a fair rent, the right to renew that
lease, and mandatory arbitration to negotiate rent increases.
Hatim Bakr Mr. Bakr operates a coffee cart in Hudson Yards. He complained that the businesses in the
Hudson Yards development have banded together to have his cart shut down by making
complaints to the NYPD, Parks Department and Health Department.
Remarks from Elected Officials and Representatives
Senator Robert The Senator was accompanied by his policy director Michael Levy who distributed copies
Jackson of the Community Update. Mr. Jackson gave the following updates:
• He attended a property tax roundtable earlier in the day where the sensitive issue of
property tax reform was discussed. He noted that the issue has been avoided by the
City Council in the past but needs to be addressed.
• There was a recent public hearing on foundation aid during which it was revealed by
the CFO of the NYC Board of Education that the City is missing about $1.1 billion
in aid from Albany according to a formula that was enacted into law under
Governor Spitzer.
• There will be a holiday party at the district office located at 213th Street and
Broadway on December 11 from 4 – 7 pm. There will also be a workshop on re-
envisioning public schools at the Castle Hill School on December 17 from 6 – 8 pm.
Brian Lewis for Mr. Lewis presented recent updates:
Borough • The first meeting of the Chelsea NYCHA Working Group was held in November
President Gale and the BP looks forward to upcoming meetings where alternative sources of
Brewer funding for NYCHA will be explored.
• The website for community board applications and reapplications is now live at
manhattanbp.nyc.gov/cbapplications. Paper applications are also acceptable, but the
online form is preferred and has been made easier to complete.
• A public hearing of the Religious Facilities Task Force was held in November with
70 people in attendance. The Task Force supports religious congregations by
upholding preservation and neighborhood vitality. The next meeting will be held in
January.
• The BP has a discretionary budget to support organizations in the borough.
Applications for Capital Grants will open soon; Cultural Tourism Grants are now
open. Non-profit and cultural organizations are encouraged to apply.
• There will be a workshop to share protocol and procedural information on street co-
naming in January or February.• The 4th Annual Holiday Diaper Drive that the BP holds in partnership with the
Foodbank for NYC and the Girl Scout Council of Greater New York has begun and
will run through January 31. Donations can be made via the Food Bank’s Amazon
Wish List or in person at the BP’s offices at 1 Centre Street or 431 West 125th
Street.
Matt Tighe for Mr. Tighe gave the following updates:
Assemblymember • Over the past couple of months, Mr. Gottfried has been traveling across the state
Dick Gottfried with State Senator Rivera to gather testimony about the New York Health Act. They
have held public hearings in the Bronx, Rockland County and along the Hudson
Valley. The bill, which will be reintroduced in the next session, is now two votes
short of a majority in the senate.
• The State Finance Commission announced its recommendations on the statewide
public finance system. It addressed third party qualifications and Mr. Gottfried
believes it should never have been a part of their considerations in the first place. He
believes that the legislature should come together to undo what he considers an
undemocratic scheme.
• The Assembly will return to Albany on January 8th and one priority that will be
immediately taken up is a $4 billion shortfall in the Medicaid budget. Mr. Gottfried
seeks to address this by not cutting any critical services but by raising revenue from
taxes assessed on the wealthiest New Yorkers.
Kevin Jean Mr. Jean Baptiste made two brief announcements:
Baptiste for D.A. • The D.A.’s Office has expanded citywide its supervised-release program that was
Cyrus Vance begun in 2016 with $13.6 million in asset forfeiture funding. The program allows
the D.A. to ask a judge for supervised release instead of bail. It has proved to be
very successful.
• In November, D.A. Vance announced the Vehicular Violence Accountability Act
alongside sponsors Senators Tim Kennedy and Brad Hoylman. The legislation was
drafted by the D.A.’s office upon the recommendation of a special grand jury
empaneled by D.A. Vance. The law would enable more prosecutions of dangerous
drivers by creating a new article of the Penal Law titled “Vehicular Violence,” and
establishing the new crimes of “Death By Vehicle,” a class A misdemeanor, and
“Serious Physical Injury by Vehicle,” a class B misdemeanor. Mr. Jean Baptiste
thanked CB4’s Transportation Committee for its input and support.
Taylor Ms. Abbruzzese gave the following updates:
Abbruzzese for • Last month Congresswoman Maloney was elected permanent Chairwoman of the
Congresswoman House Committee on Oversight and Reform – the first woman to hold that position.
Carolyn Maloney In addition to her work on the Impeachment Inquiry, she and representatives
Velazquez and Nadler introduced legislation to ban non-essential helicopter flights
over the City.
• The Judiciary Committee passed a resolution in support of the Equal Rights
Amendment to the Constitution, something that the Congresswoman has been
working on during her entire career.
• A bill to create a Women’s History Museum co-sponsored by Rep. Maloney passed
in committee. The Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act of 2019 also passed in the
House.
• As her first official act as Chairwoman of the Oversight Committee, Ms. Maloney
filed a lawsuit against Attorney General Barr and commerce secretary Wilbur Ross
for failure to produce subpoenaed documents regarding President Trump’s attempt
to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.
Phillip Ellison for Mr. Ellison reviewed Mr. Williams’s background as a housing and education activist, and
Public Advocate City Council member before becoming Public Advocate. He also compared Mr. Williams’s
Jumaane predecessor Tish James’s approach to the office as one focused on the legal process and Mr.
Williams Williams’s reliance on community organizing, policy and legislation as a way to achievesuccess. He noted that Mr. Williams has already taken part in introducing legislation in the
City Council and will continue to do so.

January 2018 Full Board Meeting Minutes
ULURP Applications for New Mixed-Use Developments Using Transferable
PRESENTATION &
Development Rights from Hudson River Park
PUBLIC HEARING
Betty Mackintosh, co-chair of the Chelsea Land Use Committee, explained the
general contours of these two applications and the actions that CB4 will take in the
ULURP process. The applications relate to a proposed rezoning and special permit
provisions for construction of two buildings on Block 675 which lies between 29th
and 30th Streets and 11th and 12th Avenues. A building at 601 West 29th Street will
be developed by Douglaston Development LLC, and another will be built by
Lalezarian Properties at 606 West 30th Street. Both buildings will use development
rights transferred by the Hudson River Park Trust from floor area available on Piers
59, 60 and 61. The proposed price for such floor area is $304 per square foot. The
applicants will pay approximately $46.6 million for 153,063 square feet.
The applicants outlined their proposals in a slide presentation that condensed the
information they shared at a Chelsea Land Use Committee meeting held on
December 18th.
• The Lalezarian development will replace a single-story structure that has 150
feet of frontage on West 30th Street and is currently zoned for light
manufacturing uses. The new building will be a 36-story mixed residential-
commercial building containing approximately 218 dwelling units; 25% of
total floor area will be permanently affordable pursuant to the City’s
Mandatory Inclusionary Housing program. Lalezarian’s ULURP application
requests amendments to the Zoning Resolution and zoning map along with
provision for a special permit to facilitate the development rights transfer.
• The Douglaston development will be built on an L-shaped property that
fronts on 11th Avenue and West 29th Street. It will include a 62-story
building with up to 198 as-of -right accessory parking spaces. Out of a
possible three options for ground floor use, the most likely will include an
EMS station that would replace the existing facility on West 23rd Street near
10th Avenue. That scenario would produce approximately 917 dwelling
units with 25% of total floor area coming from the MIH program, as it does
in the Lalezarian project.
Two speakers from the public made comments following the presentation:
• Omar Ahmed, a resident in the neighboring OHM building, spoke in support
of the proposed Block 675 development saying it would be good for the
neighborhood by increasing foot traffic.
• Tony Simone is the director for consumer affairs of Hudson River Park
1Friends. He was thankful for the opportunity to speak for his organization’s
interest in obtaining the maximum value for air rights being sold by the Trust
to fund the build out of the park.
Written testimony was submitted by Joe Rose prior to the hearing concerning the
valuation of the development rights to be transferred by the Hudson River Park
Trust. Mr. Rose is a member of the board of Friends of Hudson River Park and is a
former board member of the Hudson River Park Trust and former chair of the City
Planning Commission. He made clear that he was submitting testimony solely on his
own behalf. Mr. Rose is of the belief that the appraisals relied upon by the applicants
are defective in that they are based on faulty assumptions. He recommends a sales
price in line with that of development rights that were recently transferred from Pier
40. That price was $500 per square foot of floor area and, if applied with respect to
Block 675, would yield an additional $30 million to the Trust.
There were several questions from board members that primarily concerned air rights
valuation, building height, the distribution of affordable units within buildings, and
the EMS station. Each of these topics will be addressed in upcoming committee
meetings and the next general meeting of the board on February 7th, at which time a
final recommendation letter will be voted upon.
Public Session
Jenna Ms. Chrisphonte is a former CB4 office staff member who is currently the director of

Corey Johnson new chair and thanked the outgoing chair. Then he announced that he had just been

the community. PABT has been improving on-time delivery of buses from the
terminal to New Jersey and updating bus tracking system inside the terminal to keep
buses off city streets. PABT has partnered with Urban Pathways, the homeless
outreach provider, to identify chronically homeless neighbors in the PABT and
surrounding area to connect them with services. They have an on-site psychiatric
nurse to help with immediate needs. Mr. Shaff stated that PABT has put artwork up

March 2018 Full Board Meeting Minutes
Manhattan Community Board 4 Response to the Fiscal Year 2019 Preliminary
PUBLIC HEARING
Budget.
Jeffrey LeFrancois, co-chair of the Budget Task Force, reviewed the board’s role in
the preparation of the City Budget for the next fiscal year that begins on July 1st.
This hearing is one part of the process that gives the community board the
opportunity to respond to the Mayor’s preliminary budget. The Task Force decided
to frame its response in the form of a prioritized list of eleven items that were
submitted last year but failed to get the Mayor’s approval for inclusion in the 2018
Budget. He noted the great success that the board has had in past years in getting the
community’s needs addressed in the budget.
He asked for comments and questions from the public and, hearing none, declared
the hearing closed.
Public Session
James Wallace Mr. Wallace, who is a board member, spoke as a member of the community in reminding
those present that it was Arts Week with several exhibitions happening around the City.
One of the world’s most prominent art exhibitions – The Armory Show ₋₋ is taking place
from March 8th through the 12th at Piers 92 and 94 located at Twelfth Avenue and 55th
Street.
Remarks from Elected Officials and Representatives
Afraz Kahn for The office is currently reviewing the Block 675 proposals within the ULURP process
BP Gale Brewer and is expected to submit its comments in agreement with the position taken by CB4.
The BP, along with Speaker Johnson and other elected officials, met with DOT
Commissioner Trottenberg regarding the L Train shutdown to ensure that the study that
DOT conducted will be shared with them.
The office sent a letter to DOT regarding newspaper dispensers on City sidewalks asking
that they be better maintained in the Midtown South area where they have become a
nuisance.
Robert Atterbury The congressman spoke at a hearing today against a bail reform measure that he believes
for Congressman would weaken the bail system for pretrial detainees. He also complained at that hearingJerrold Nadler about the House not taking up any gun control measures during the current session.
Mr. Nadler joined other officials and advocates asking OMB Director Mick Mulvaney to
withdraw his proposal to remove the World Trade Center Health Program for 9/11
responders from the direction of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and
Health. Although no longer a member of the House Transportation Committee, he has
continued to work with its members regarding federal funding contributions to the
Gateway Project.
Eli Szenes- Senator Hoylman is a co-sponsor, along with assembly members Glick, Gottfried and
Strauss for State Rosenthal, of bus trip to Washington, D.C. on March 24th for people wishing to join the
Senator Brad March for Our Lives protest. Flyers were made available at the meeting.
Hoylman
The senator is seeking to close a loophole in New York’s Safe Act which bans assault
weapons by making it illegal for those under 21 to possess long guns. Currently, the law
simply prohibits their purchase.
Senator Hoylman’s Child Victims Act was included in Governor Cuomo’s executive
budget this year and, because of that, it is likely that it will become law in April. The Act
removes the statute of limitations for prosecution and filing of civil suits related to child
sexual abuse.
Carl Wilson for Carl made his first presentation as Speaker Johnson’s new liaison to CB4, replacing Matt
Council Speaker Green who has a new position in the office.
Corey Johnson
The free community screening of the film Saturday Church that the Speaker was
scheduled to host tonight at the SVA Theatre will now be held on Tuesday, March 20th.
Next Tuesday, March 13th, the Speaker’s monthly housing clinic will be held at the
district office from 5:30 to 7:30 P.M.
Hartley House decided last week to close its 46th Street location. Speaker Johnson will
begin meetings next week with members of the community and CB4, as well as other
elected officials, to assist Hartley House in its efforts to remain in the community and
continue providing services.

newsstand in place. This newsstand would also have a negative impact on the revenues of their
food court, which is a significant revenue stream for the institution.

May 2018 Full Board Meeting Minutes
There was no presentation or public hearing this month.
PRESENTATION /
PUBLIC HEARING
Public Session
Jason Toledano Scout Toledano spoke about the Boy Scouts program and the role it plays in the
community. He said its aim is to teach leadership and confidence by providing unique
outdoor experiences. Many of the young people living in the CB4 community currently
do not have access to the opportunities offered by the Boy Scouts. Mr. Toledano provided
flyers that outline ways to get a scout troupe established in MCD4.
Jeffrey Speaking on behalf of the Meatpacking BID, Jeffrey announced a joint event with the
LeFrancois Lower Eastside Ecology Center that will be held on May 11th at 14th Street and Eighth
Avenue where people will be able to dispose of unwanted electronic devices for
recycling.
David Tillyer Mr. Tillyer noted the upcoming meeting of the Waterfront, Parks and Environment
Committee where issues concerning Clinton Park will be discussed. He offered members
of the committee and the community the opportunity to walk through the park with him to
observe the areas where he believes remedial action is needed.
Tiffany Henkel Ms. Henkel is the pastor of Metro Baptist Church. She is also the chair of the Hell’s
Kitchen South Coalition, the group whose community plan endorsement by CB4 is the
subject of Agenda Item 18. She thanked the board for its support.
Lisa Wager Ms. Wager of the Fashion Institute of Technology gave an update on recent activities and
upcoming events at FIT, all of which can be viewed at www.fitnyc.edu.
Susan Berg Ms. Berg is a resident of the Chelsea Hotel who spoke about security issues at the hotel.
She said that there was no way for residents to contact the front desk now that house
phones have been removed during the renovation of the hotel. Even though management
has provided cell phones to residents, it is not possible for elderly residents to simply dial
“0” to reach the front desk in the event of an emergency as they have for decades. An
even greater safety issue has arisen from management’s having severed all landlines to
Verizon without prior notice to tenants. Ms. Berg also bemoaned the closing of Dan’s
Chelsea Guitar, a longtime fixture in the community. She believes management could
1have taken measures to preserve this business but chose not to do so.
Jonathan Berg Mr. Berg is also a resident of the Chelsea Hotel; he has lived there for forty-five years. He
has not had a landline for several months and, because of this, he cannot conduct his
business. He blames management for not knowing how to deal with tenants, even though,
he admits, they are able to successfully run several hotels. He further pointed out that the
reason we tend not to hear many complaints coming from residents is that they have
signed agreements with management that require all complaints to go only to the head of
the tenant’s committee who chooses to remain silent in exchange for a newly refurbished
room.
Remarks from Elected Officials and Representatives
Afraz Kahn for Ms. Brewer recently held a Borough Board meeting where representatives of the MTA
BP Gale Brewer and DOT discussed the L Train shutdown. The Borough Board will continue to provide
a platform through which community boards will be able to add their input on issues
related to the shutdown.
The BP had a meeting with Brookfield to stay abreast of the construction of Manhattan
West. She also met with CHEKPEDS to review recent updates to its Crash Mapper tool;
she noted her willingness to provide more funding to support it.
The BP initiated a Charter revision commission with Public Advocate Tish James that
will be holding a town hall meeting next month. There will also be a reception for new
and returning community board members on June 19th at the American Museum of
Natural History.
Robert Atterbury Congressman Nadler was pleased to see the passage of the Music Modernization Act,
for Congressman which he supported. The Act is intended to address longstanding inequities in the music
Jerrold Nadler marketplace that have become more pronounced with the advent of streaming services.
Last month he announced the introduction of the Special Counsel Independence and
Integrity Act that limits President Trump’s ability to fire Special Counsel Mueller and
interfere with the investigation into Russian election meddling.
Congressmen Nadler and Bobby Scott released a Government Accountability Office
report that shows disparate discipline policies and practices applied to students of color,
boys and students with disabilities that result in harsher discipline for those students.
They called upon the Trump Administration to take serious note of the findings in this
report.
Congressman Nadler continues to work with his counterparts to have the Gateway
Project move forward.
Erica Overton for The Assembly passed the Child Victims Act and it is now in the State Senate where it is
Assemblymember hoped Brad Hoylman can help get it passed.
Linda Rosenthal
There will be a rally on May 7th at 10 A.M. in front of the B/C subway station at 72nd

pregnant riders at that station and others in the City. The MTA announced that it would
be shutting down the stations at West 66th Street and West 72nd Street for repairs and
improvements without any provision to include elevators.
At a recent town hall with New York City Transit president, Andy Byford, he stated that
he would examine issues related to the M104 bus line and report his findings next
month.
Carl Wilson for The City Council voted to extend rent regulations and called for an overhaul of theCouncil Speaker City’s approach to easing school crowding. Speaker Johnson is most proud of a series of
Corey Johnson eleven bills called the Stop Sexual Harassment in NYC Act which mandate a host of
anti-sexual harassment trainings and prevention measures to ensure a safe and respectful
workplace.
Upcoming events include the Westside Summit on May 20th at the Highline 14th Street
passage where the Speaker will give his State of the District address and announce the

Public Hearing: City Wide Hotel Special Permits in M1 Zoning Districts
PRESENTATION/
PUBLIC HEARING Presentation: Heritage of Pride to Present on Pride March 2018 Route
Julian Sanjivan, March Director at Heritage of Pride, gave a slide presentation
outlining changes to the 2018 Pride March in format and practices:
• Route change: the route has been reversed and shortened for 2018 moving
south-bound on 7th Avenue in Chelsea, turning east on Christopher and 8th
Streets, and north on 5th Avenue to conclude at 29th Street.
• March/Street Access: all persons participating in the march will now be
required to wear wristbands to enter access points and closed streets.
Community members who live within a closed street will be required to
show ID with the corresponding address to be granted passage. Mr.
Sanjivan referenced the institution of wristbands at the Puerto Rican Day
Parade to support this method.
• Attendance: Mr. Sanjivan expects approximately 5 million people to
participate in this year’s Pride March. These new practices are being
implemented to prepare for World Pride 2019 which will take this same
route and expects a larger amount of people.
This presentation and the process of the change in practices and route were met with
concerns from the community board and neighbors. The community board was not
involved in early conversations regarding the chance in route and street closures
which could negatively impact Chelsea residents. Concerns from the board included:
residential access for neighbors who do not have ID, challenges with Access-a-Ride
pick-up/drop-off, lack of community communication and input regarding route
change, and the historical implications of taking route-change and formatting
directives from the NYPD.
The community board has expressed discontent with this year’s process and asks
Heritage of Pride to engage in conversation and partnership prior in a timely manner
for future marches.Public Session

District Manager
July 2018 Full Board Meeting Minutes
Public Hearing: Garment Center District Rezoning
PUBLIC
J.D. Noland, Chair of the Clinton/Hell’s Kitchen Land Use Committee, opened
HEARINGS
the hearing for comments on the changes to the Special Garment Center District
proposed by the Department of City Planning and the NYC Economic Development
Corporation (EDC), noting that the Board’s response is the subject of Agenda Item
32. He then introduced six speakers, whose comments are set forth below.
Public Hearing: PCE Special Permits at 560 W. 33rd Street a/k/a 35 Hudson Yards
– Equinox Fitness Club & Equinox Hotel Spa
J.D. Noland opened the hearing to public speakers and, none having come forward,
the hearing was closed.
Public Hearing: Renewal PCE Special Permit for Brick Gym 257 West 17 Street
Public Hearing: Renewal PCE Special Permit for OrangeTheory Gym at 124 West
23rd Street
Betty Mackintosh, Co-Chair of the Chelsea Land Use Committee, opened the
hearings on the Brick Gym and the OrangeTheory Gym. No speakers came forward
for either hearing, so both were closed.
Public Session – Garment Center District Rezoning
Morgan Jones Mr. Jones, an assistant vice president of the Economic Development Corporation, outlined
the proposal, the substance of which is contained in the Board’s Agenda Item 32 letter.
Dana Langman Mr. Langman is a garment designer who asked that the rezoning process be slowed down to
allow for more consideration of the long-term effects of the proposal.
Barbara Blair Ms. Blair is the President of the Garment District Alliance, which participated in the
steering committee convened by Borough President Gale Brewer and Council Speaker
Corey Johnson. She asked the Board to “approve with conditions” rather than “deny unless”
the application for rezoning. She believes that this wording acknowledges the significant
progress that has been made by the many people and entities who have worked on
preserving the district.
1Teresa Snider Ms. Stien is a costume designer and associate professor of costume design at Brooklyn
Stien College. She spoke on behalf of the members of Union Local 829 and the students at City
colleges who have a connection to the Garment District. She believes that it would be
counter-productive to open up the district to developers through rezoning before the plans
for preservation have been finalized.
Katie Sue Ms. Nicklos owns a forty-year-old glove manufacturing business located in the district. She
Nicklos would like to see the tax incentives offered to landlords who provide manufacturing leases
extended from the proposed 15-year period to a permanent affordability option.
Samantha Ms. Cortes is the executive director of Save the Garment Center and a resident of MCD4.
Cortes She believes that it would be greatly harmful to existing manufacturers in the district if
safeguards are not put in place for easy transitioning after the zoning restrictions are lifted.
That means suspending such action until the programs that have been proposed are proven
effective.
Public Session – General Concerns
Rita Lee Ms. Lee was the district manager of CB2 for 26 years. She spoke on behalf of the new
Lincoln Plaza Cinema, which is scheduled to close at the end of August. She invited all
to attend the final viewings at the cinema and provided fliers.
Dan Pichinson Mr. Pichinson is the new executive director of the Ryan/Chelsea Community Health Center
located on Tenth Avenue between 45th and 46th Streets. He introduced Brian McAdoo, the
President and CEO of the Center. His organization serves about 10,000 patients annually,
with 75-80% of those patients living within the boundaries of MCD4. About 50% of
patients are on Medicaid, 15% are uninsured, and 15% are on Medicare. The Center has
received a grant from a charitable foundation that will fund several geriatric services that
the community has indicated a need for. The Center will also soon be starting a new
program focused on the needs of people struggling with opioid addiction.
The week of August 12th through the 19th is National Health Center Week. The Ryan
Center will be holding events outside on Tenth Avenue, one of which is healthy food
preparation. Samples will be served.
Dave Duke Mr. Duke voiced a complaint about the bike lane that runs along West 26th Street between
8th and 9th Avenues. He stated that the configuration of the bike lane has made his block
dangerous because of traffic buildup and the difficulty in parallel parking due to a sidewalk
extension. Mr. Duke was advised that his concerns would be addressed at the next
Transportation Committee meeting in September.
Dave Fulton Mr. Fulton is the president of the board of Chelsea Commons, a condominium building that
sits behind four historic former rowhouse facades located at 305-313 West 22nd Street.
There is an application pending before the Landmarks Preservation Commission that
proposes window replacements. The application was reviewed by the CLU Committee and
a letter to the Commission was written and then approved by the Executive Committee. It
was mailed to the Commission because of time requirements and is now to be taken up for
ratification in Agenda Item 38. CB4 has taken the position that the proposed window
replacements are not appropriate and requested that a public hearing be held on the matter
instead of it being resolved though staff review. Mr. Fulton takes objection to this.
Mandisa Ms. Wright spoke on behalf of the Women’s Building, the old women’s prison building on
Wright West 20th Street between 10th and 11th Avenues. She announced their third annual block
party which will be held on September 22nd. The event is intended to involve the
community in the programs offered at the Women’s Building that are aimed at training and
employment for formerly incarcerated women.
Lisa Wager Ms. Wager, the Director of Community Relations at the Fashion Institute of Technology,
offered news of recent events. One recent graduate, Grace Ansonia, assembled a collection
of her designs for her graduate thesis and one piece caught the eye of a famous hip hopartist who wore the piece at the FIT Runway Show. It was remarkable for the fact that it
was worn by a plus-size model.
FIT students teamed up with the Honeybee Conservancy and the Sustainability Council to
install beehives on the green roof that goes over 27th Street. The hive can be seen live 24/7
with the Bee Cam fitnyc.edu/sustainability
Remarks from Elected Officials and Representatives
Assemblymember Ms. Rosenthal announced the decision by DOT to install a dedicated left turn signal at
Linda Rosenthal the intersection of 8th Avenue and 57th Street and credited the work of her office and
CHEKPEDS over a period of four years.
Ms. Rosenthal expressed her disappointment with State senators who left Albany for
vacation in June before voting to extend the school zone safety camera program that was
set to expire on July 25th. The program has proved to be an effective deterrent to
speeding. She has called on them to return to Albany immediately.
She sponsored a bill that is awaiting the Governor’s signature that will require free
feminine hygiene products to be provided to individuals housed state and local
correctional facilities. She also co-sponsored a bill that passed in the Senate and
Assembly that would require the MTA to hold a public hearing when it plans to shut
down a subway station for more than three months.
Shred Day – the day when residents can have old papers shredded professionally – will
be held this coming Sunday from 10 am to 2 pm outside Ms. Rosenthal’s office at 230
West 72nd Street.

September 2018 Full Board Meeting Minutes
There were no presentations or public hearings this month.
PRESENTATIONS /
PUBLIC HEARINGS
Public Session
Ashley Ms. Gonzalez spoke on behalf of the Muhlenberg Public Library promoting Library Card
Gonzalez Month. She made applications available to those in attendance.
Marla DeFex Ms. DeFex is a resident of Manhattan Plaza and a member of Disabled In Action, an
organization that represents people with disabilities. She spoke in favor of the Board’s
proposed guidelines for business owners with respect to making entrances ADA compliant.
These guidelines will be outlined in a flyer that will be introduced into the Business License
and Permits process. She stated that there are currently 107 businesses in the community
that do not have ADA compliant entrances. She thanked the Transportation Committee for
creating the flyers. The flyer and the plan to distribute them will be on next month’s
agenda.
Martin Treat Mr. Treat, who is a board member, echoed all that Ms. DeFex stated. He, too, is a member
of Disabled In Action.
Earl Bateman Mr. Bateman of the Paul Kasmin Gallery at 515 West 27th Street introduced himself as a
representative of the many art galleries in West Chelsea. He noted that the area, for its size,
has the highest concentration of galleries in the world. Because of the current shift in the
economies affecting the middle galleries in the district, he expects to seek the help of CB4
and to attend future meetings.
Daryl Cochrane Mr. Cochrane introduced himself as the Director of the Manhattan Community Service
Center of the NYC Commission on Human Rights, the City agency that enforces the non-
discrimination laws. He displayed a poster that addresses the new Sexual Harassment Act.
It will be required to be posted in English and Spanish in all NYC businesses beginning
tomorrow, although it will not be enforced for another six months.
He noted a new law that prevents employers from asking about a person’s salary history in
job applications. He also presented a flyer on discriminatory harassment that deals with the
two dozen protected classes such as race, gender and sexual orientation. It explains the
procedure by which to file a complaint with his agency and notes that the last act of
harassment must have occurred within the last twelve months.
He further noted that his agency gives advice on ADA compliance and that staff membersare available to do measurements and assessments at residences and businesses.
Lisa Wager Ms. Wager is the Director of Government and Community Relations at the Fashion Institute
of Technology. She announced a new exhibition entitled Pink: The History of the Punk,
Pretty, Powerful Color. It explores the changing significance of the color pink over the past
three centuries.
FIT was recognized for its best practices for work and energy efficiency. Its master plan for
energy efficiency has yielded a savings of over $3 million a year for taxpayers.
Inge Ivchenko Ms. Ivchenko, who is a board member and resident of London Terrace, announced the
annual London Terrace Street Festival that benefits the Holy Apostle Soup Kitchen. It is the
most unique street fair in the city having artists from all parts of the city, as well as furniture
and clothing designers. There will be a variety of vendors, but very little food. The fair will
be held on Saturday, September 22nd from 10 am to 5 pm on 24th Street between 9th and
10th Avenues.
Remarks from Elected Officials and Representatives
Assemblymember Mr. Gottfried reviewed the status of the law regarding school-zone speed cameras, noting
Dick Gottfried that after the state Senate refused to renew the law which expired in July, it became
necessary for the Governor to issue an executive order extending the law for thirty days in
time for the beginning of the school year. It then became necessary for the City Council
and the Mayor to enact a local law to implement the extension. Mr. Gottfried is hopeful
that state law will ultimately be enacted so as to avoid local action having to be taken
every month.
He went on to mention the ribbon cuttings at Chelsea Waterside Park and Matthews-
Palmer Playground.
Afraz Kahn for Ms. Brewer, the City Council Speaker and the Public Advocate sponsored legislation that
BP Gale Brewer established the 2019 Charter Revision Commission. It will hold hearings over the next
year, develop proposals and make recommendations that will appear on the ballot in
November of 2019. The first round of hearings will begin in the Bronx on September
12th and continue in the other boroughs throughout September.
The Mayor has his own Charter Revision Commission which, among other things, has
proposed term limits for community board members. This is something that Ms. Brewer
is adamantly against, given the institutional knowledge that board members gain over
time. She and the other Borough Presidents have sent a letter to the Mayor’s Commission
voicing their objections to this proposal and others.
In August, Ms. Brewer and other elected officials took a bus tour with DOT Director
Trottenberg to examine the bus routes that will be affected by the L Train shutdown. The
dialogue resulting from this tour is ongoing.
Brennan Ward Mr. Ward announced a new festival called Little Dominican Republic that will resemble
for State Senator others such as the Little Italy and Little Odessa Festivals. The unveiling will take place at
Marisol 12 pm on Friday, September 7th at West 175th Street and Broadway.
Alcantara
Kevin Jean- October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month and the D.A.’s Office, along with other
Baptiste for partners, conducts a march from the State office building in Harlem to 116th Street and
Manhattan Francis Lewis Boulevard where victims of domestic violence gather to speak about their
District Attorney personal experiences. The event starts at 5:30 pm on October 1st.
Cyrus Vance
Beginning September 4th, the D.A.’s Office initiated a criminal justice diversion program
for individuals caught in possession of small amounts of marijuana. It is a pre-
arraignment program that results in the issuance of a desk appearance ticket for those whoagree to participate in one of the programs offered to them, such as job training and
education. Upon completion of the program and before the desk appearance date, the
D.A. will decline to prosecute the charge of possession.
Effective August 1st, the D.A.’s stopped prosecuting people for smoking and possessing
under 25 grams of marijuana in public. Exceptions to this policy include instances where
a person is deemed a public safety threat or engaged in the act of selling.
Board Reports & Business
Adoption of Agenda and The Agenda was approved unanimously. The July minutes were approved with
Minutes one abstention.
District Manager Report Highlights of events the District Manager or Staff attended on behalf of the
board and upcoming events:
Upcoming News:
• CB4 District Office will be getting a 2-year extension on our current
lease. Because of the speed at which the city approves office space, we
will continue to look for new office space.
• CB4 will partner with NYC Business Solutions and the Greenwich
Village Chelsea Chamber of Commerce as well as the Hudson
Yards\Hell’s Kitchen Alliance to host two small business trainings. The
first will be October 29th at 10 am at 239 West 14th Street at the
Spanish Benevolent Society. The Second will be Tuesday, December
11th at 11 am at 412 West 42nd Street, 3rd Floor.
Meetings attended:
CB4 conducted several site visits to help resolve city service issues:
• West 39th (10/11 Aves): blocking of sidewalk and illegal parking
• West 29th Street (11th Ave): pedestrian safety issues
• West 46th Street (8th Ave): illegal bus loading/unloading and parking
August Committee Updates and Board Reminders:
• ACES – Thursday, September 6th – 305 West 44th St, 2nd Floor
• TRANS – Thursday, September 13th – 305 West 44th St, 2nd Floor
• BLP – Monday, September 17th – Fountain House, 425 West 47th St,
Lower Level
• All Other Committees remain the same
Mr. Bodine thanked Nelly Gonzalez and Janine Pretente for their help keeping
the board running so smoothly.
Board Chair Report The Chair mentioned the CB4 social event that took place in July where CB4
hats were distributed. The idea for the hats came from CB12 and is intended to
give members the opportunity to wear the hat in the community with the goal of
engaging others in a conversation about the workings of CB4.
The Chair also reminded members of the bio page on the CB4 website that
provides the bios of the members who submitted them for inclusion. He asked
everyone to consider submitting a bio to the District Manager.
The opening of Chelsea Waterside Park was a welcome event, but there are still
a few unresolved problems with the park that are being addressed with Speaker
Corey Johnson’s office.There was a meeting last month regarding problems at the homeless facility on
48th Street known as Urban Pathways. This was in addition to meetings
concerning ongoing problems at the Aladdin Hotel shelter that is supposed to be
in the process of shutting down.
Another meeting was held with the Borough President’s office to discuss the
decade-old issue of the promised affordable housing that was to be constructed
on the parking lot site at the NYCHA Harborview Terrace complex. The Mayor
had a private meeting in August where several alternative ideas were discussed,
including adding 70% of the new units as market rate units instead of the
building being 100% affordable.
The Transportation Committee had a meeting with the developer of the new
Target store on the old Hess gas station site on 10th Avenue.
The annual election of the five board officers will take place in December.
Anyone wishing to run for office should submit their name and resume to the
nominating committee after the submission date is announced in October.

District Manager
October 2018 Full Board Meeting Minutes
Public Hearing: PCE Special Permit at 450 West 33rd Street – Peloton Interactive,
Inc.
PRESENTATIONS /
J.D. Noland, chair of the Clinton/Hell’s Kitchen Land Use Committee, opened the
PUBLIC HEARINGS
hearing and, with no speakers coming forward, declared the hearing closed.
Public Session
Vanessa Puzio Ms. Puzio is a Supervising Attorney for the Sex Crimes Unit at the Manhattan District
Attorney’s Office. She is also the head of the Work-Related Sex Crimes Initiative whose
main goal is to encourage victims of sex crimes in the workplace to come forward and
begin the criminal justice process. The task force visits community boards, schools, and
businesses to make its services known to the public. This outreach has resulted in an uptick
in calls to its hotline from about 20 to over 120 per month. The program streamlines the
complaint process by giving victims the ability to bypass a visit to a police precinct and
speak directly to a prosecutor. Ms. Puzio brought flyers to the meeting.
Tina Tina is a board member who spoke on her own behalf as a member of the community. She
DiFeliciantonio requested the Transportation Committee to re-evaluate the street layout of West 26th Street
between 6th and 7th Avenues because of construction on two sites in the middle of the
block that will probably continue for years. The issue has to do with bikes in the bike lane
being rerouted around the Jersey barriers in front of the sites. It creates a dangerous path
where one must navigate around dumpsters, rubbish and other debris on the street.
Tina complained about traffic enforcement agents who have made it a practice to unfairly
target motorcycles and scooters. Because the NYPD has designated the blocks between
24th and 28th Streets as being prone to theft and tampering, the agents have seen it fit to
target these vehicles with tickets and towing.
Miranda Ms. Masse is the Director of the Climate Museum. It is the first initiative in the nation and
Massie the second in the world to create a museum dedicated to climate change, climate solutions
and climate progress. The museum currently has ten exhibitions around the City, one of
which is in Hudson River Park at Pier 84. On Saturday the 6th of October, NASA climate
scientists will be at Pier 84 to answer questions about climate science. The site is open
every day from 7 am to Midnight. Ms. Masse made flyers available.
Susan Lahn Ms. Lahn shared her concerns regarding ambulance access to Mt. Sinai West Hospital. The
problem has arisen since 60th Street has become a one-way westbound street. Now,
ambulances coming up 10th Avenue must travel all the way up to 62nd Street to get over to
Columbus Avenue in order to come back down to the hospital on 59th Street. It also causes
a problem for ambulances leaving the hospital on 59th Street when making a calldowntown. Ms. Lahn asked for the board’s help in having 59th Street turned into a two-way
street. She believes that the hospital administration may be reluctant to ask for this change
because doctors and staff park their cars on 59th Street.
Chris Mills Mr. Mills is a pastor at Gallery Church in Chelsea. He introduced his wife Sarah who works
for the Fellowship for Performing Arts, a theatre production company located in Hell’s
Kitchen. FPA produces theater from a Christian worldview to engage a diverse audience.
Mr. Mills stated that he was attending the meeting to listen to the needs of the community
and to pray and show his love for the community.
Lisa Wager Ms. Wager is the Director of Government and Community Relations at the Fashion Institute
of Technology. She mentioned a couple of public programming events:
• FIT is in the middle of its Sustainability Awareness Week. The program includes
several workshops, lectures and tours. There is a tour of the green roof on Thursday
October 4th at 6 pm.
• On October 29th the Lawrence Israel Lecture will be held with the renowned
architect Annabelle Selldorf being honored. The event will take place in the Katie
Murphy Amphitheater from 6 to 8 pm.
Joe Restuccia Joe is a board member who spoke on behalf of Clinton Housing Development Company of
which he is the executive director. He announced that applications had just become
available for the Site Seven project on West 53rd Street between 10th and 11th Avenues.
There are 102 affordable apartments available to people in single households making
$39,000 up to a family of four making $172,000 with no gaps in between. Applications
must be submitted by December 7th through Housing Connect. There is a 50% preference
for residents living in MCD4.
Remarks from Elected Officials and Representatives
Congressman Mr. Nadler began by noting that it is a very divisive time in Washington and in the
Jerrold Nadler country. He believes there is a crisis in the country now because the Trump
Administration is not following the norms of democratic procedure. For example, the
President is not supposed to step in and tell the F.B.I. who to prosecute or not prosecute.
He thinks the President, out of ignorance, is subverting democracy by undermining the
press; by attacking the independence of the judiciary; and, by attacking the judges, the
Justice Department and the F.B.I. Another aspect of the current crisis has to do with the
constitutionally imposed system of checks and balances where Congress is supposed to
be a check on the administration and the administration is supposed to be a check on
Congress. All three branches should be a check on the actions of each other. So, in the
case of children being separated from their parents at the border, there should be hearings
in Congress on that. But that has not happened. The current Administration has also
chosen to join in lawsuits against democratically enacted laws such as provisions of the
Affordable Care Act that deal with the cost of health care insurance charged to those with
pre-existing conditions. The Administration should be defending the constitutionality of
this statute, rather than seek to disable it. A similar course of action has been taken in
cases where various states have enacted laws that enable voter suppression. Congress has
not exercised its oversight responsibilities in holding the Administration responsible for
any of these actions. Nor has it chosen to investigate over one hundred topics that have
been identified by the press as needing scrutiny by the legislative branch.
Mr. Nadler brought up the Brett Kavanaugh nomination to the Supreme Court. He
pointed to Judge Kavanaugh’s Judiciary Committee testimony wherein he attacked the
process as a Democratic plot against his confirmation. The judges’ words, he said, were
not what one would expect from a dispassionate, neutral jurist sitting on a U.S. circuitcourt. His impartiality is now cause for concern. Mr. Nadler went on to give an
enlightening review of the history of the Supreme Court since the period before the Civil
War. He made the point that presidents have always primarily picked judges based on
their qualifications as judges rather than based on a list provided by a single source that is
influenced by a particular ideology.
Taysha Clark for The Senator’s office organized a Know Your Rights meeting for tenants facing landlord
State Senator harassment.
Brad Hoylman
He sent a letter to the Department of Education regarding the delay in releasing the results
of public school test scores noting the hardship that it has caused to families and
requesting that it be addressed as soon as possible.
There will be free flu shots available in the office on November 30th from 10 am to 2 pm.
Carl Wilson for The Speaker was proud to announce on September 22nd that Hartley House will be able
Council Speaker to remain at its current century-old location on West 46th Street. He thanked the Hudson
Corey Johnson Guild, Clinton Housing, CB4 and elected officials for their efforts.
Free flu shots will be given at the district office on Thursday, October 11th from 10 am to
5 pm. Call or email the office to RSVP.
The latest Participatory Budgeting cycle began on September 23rd. There are three
upcoming Neighborhood Assemblies scheduled where residents can share ideas, learn
about project eligibility, and sign-up to be a Budget Delegate. The meetings will run from
6:30 to 8:30 pm at each of these locations: City and County School on October 10th, New
York City Lab School on the 17th and Midtown West on the 18th.
The Council has calendared a meeting on October 22nd covering the Small Business Jobs
Survival Act, a piece of legislation that has been lingering in the Council for years. The
Speaker has promised to finally hold a hearing on this.
The Speaker reacted to the proposed plan by the MTA to install an electrical substation
on West 28th Street between 8th and 9th Avenues. It would lie within the residential Penn
South complex where noise from the machinery is an issue. The MTA did not seek any
input from residents before its announcement, nor did it consider noise when choosing the
site. After meeting with the Speaker, the MTA president agreed to evaluate alternative
sites.
Mike Stinson for Mr. Stinson stated that last week the Comptroller’s Office released a report on housing
Comptroller affordability that showed that since 2005, due to rising rents the City lost over 425,000
Scott Stringer affordable apartments renting for $1,000 or less. They were replaced by 120,000 units
renting for over $2,700 per month. In 2005, 78% of those apartments were renting for
$1,200 or less. In 2016, only 60% were renting at that same amount. The Comptroller is
looking to form a coalition with the state Senate after the election to update the rent laws
– measures that were put on hold in the previous Senate.
Mr. Stinson provided copies of sixty of his charter amendment proposals. They deal with
such matter as land use, government transparency, wealth creation in communities of
color, and, procurement reforms. One of the main things he’s calling for is a chief
diversity officer in City Hall and each City agency to create more opportunities for
Minority and Women-Owned Businesses.
Councilmember Ms. Rosenthal passed around summaries of bills that were signed into law by the Mayor
Helen Rosenthal having to do with sexual harassment in the workplace. As Chair of the Committee on
Women, she was able to advance the bills through the Council successfully. She said she
believes that the NYPD’s Special Victims Unit does not treat survivors of sexual abuse
well. When a survivor walks into a police precinct to make a complaint, they often feel
humiliated. The Council is working on a package of bills aimed at changing police
behavior in such situations.The Council is also working on bills to address the disparity between black and white
morbidity during childbirth. Black women are twelve times more likely to die during
childbirth than white women.
With respect to the NYCHA complex Harborview Terrace, the Council has asked the
Mayor to explain in person to tenants his revised plan for the development of the long-
ago promised affordable building on the parking lot of the complex. Specifically, the
Mayor should explain the justification for wanting to replace the proposed 16-story,
100% affordable building with a 60-story building containing market rate units along
with the promised affordable units.
Borough Ms. Brewer reminded everyone that the national census was getting closer and that there
President Gale are issues that must be addressed to ensure an accurate count in the City. She noted that
Brewer Providence was experimenting with an online census, and it was not going well. She
asked the board to consider steps that the City might pursue.
She is in favor of closing Riker’s Island, but admits that the process is not easy. The
Mayor’s suggestion to convert 80 Centre Street into a local jail has been met with serious
objections from the residents of Chinatown.
Planning for the L Train shutdown appears to be going well, but the big issue is one that
was raised by Brad Hoylman: the busses coming over the bridge are not clean. There are
many small issues that still must be addressed as well.
Applications for the Borough President’s Youth Council are due October 29th.
Ms. Brewer has a new program called Borough Presidents on Your Block that will
initially work with four or five NYCHA developments. She continues to work with
Speaker Johnson on the food bank for seniors program. She invited the board to meet
with her to discuss capital funding requests. She thanked the board for its work on
keeping the Garment Center a viable manufacturing district.
Ms. Brewer, speaking as a private citizen, gave her thoughts on the Mayor’s three
proposed City Charter revisions that will be voted on this November 6th. The first one on
the ballot has to do with campaign finance. She is very much against the second proposal
which deals with the establishment of a Civic Engagement Commission because it is a
mayoral commission that does not allow for enough community involvement and because
its duties are not well-defined. She is also opposed to the third proposal which establishes
term limits for community board members. This would result in the removal of many
members who have accumulated the necessary knowledge and experience required to
deal with complex issues such as land use and zoning.
State Senator Senator Hoylman arrived at the end of the meeting due to his schedule in Albany. He
Brad Hoylman expressed his hope that everyone votes in November, reminding everyone that the next
Friday was the last day to register. He also thanked Speaker Johnson, board member
Restuccia and the Hudson Guild for their work in saving Hartley House. He concluded
with the status of the L Train shutdown and his recent op-ed column criticizing the MTA
for buying 200 new diesel busses when they should have invested in renewable natural
gas and electric busses. He said that he would continue to monitor the project to ensure
that air quality monitors would be installed along the entire length of the route.Board Reports & Business
Adoption of Agenda and The Agenda was amended to table Item 2 and withdraw Items 3 and 14; it was
Minutes then approved unanimously. The September minutes were also approved
unanimously.
Nominating Committee Frank Holozubiec, Chair of the Nominating Committee, announced that, after
Report soliciting the members for those who desired to run for board offices, only the
existing members expressed an interest to continue in office. Interviews of
nominees will be held at the end of October and the Committee will present a
slate of recommended nominees at the November general meeting.
Budget Task Force Report Jeffrey LeFrancois, Chair of the Budget Committee, stated that over the past
week the Committee reviewed the board’s Statement of District Needs to see if
it needed any updating. As it turned out, many of the things that the board had
been asking for over the years were granted last year. This was probably the
result of streamlining the Statement and highlighting the items that were of the
greatest importance, thus drawing the attention of the relevant agencies.
Jeffrey then pointed to the sheets at the back of the room where attendees could
write their ideas and specific requests for inclusion in the new Statement of
District Needs. He also reminded the chairs of each committee to prepare their
input. The District Manager noted that each committee chair would be
receiving a form in their monthly information packet that would make the
submission process easier.

Public Session
Alice Truax Board President for Hartley House; Hartley House is a settlement house serving Hell’s
Kitchen since 1897. They offer programming in after school, tutoring, arts, and senior
services. Ms. Truax is grateful that they continue to operate out of the original Hartley
House after a possibility of displacement. Thanked Speaker Corey Johnson and City
Hall, Ken Jockers from Hudson Guild, and Joe Restuccia from Clinton Housing
Development Corporation for helping Hartley House retain their space.
Yesenia Zuniga Executive Director of Hartley House; thanked elected officials, Hudson Guild, and
Clinton Housing Development Corporation. Ms. Zuniga announced that Hartley House
will be hosting a holiday party on Tuesday December 18th at 5 PM.
Tristan Loanzon Parent of P.S. 111 students; asks the NYC Department of Education (DOE) to review
their Educational Impact Statement (EIS) concerning the possible co-location of a
middle school in P.S. 111. Mr. Loanzon asks DOE to delay the vote until the EIS is
amended with an impact statement. Mr. Loanzon and other parents have circulated a
petition on Change.org which 700 people have signed on to.
Evelyn Parent of a special needs student at P.S. 111; Ms. Choudhury’s child receives therapy at
Choudhury P.S. 111. She is concerned that the current therapy room would be used by the
prospective middle school causing the current therapy room to be co-located to a small
room in the basement.
Tai Do Parent of a P.S. 111 student; Mr. Do asks DOE to amend the EIS with an impact
statement. The current EIS does not consider the impact of time-slicing facilities like the
gym, library, and playground.Zhanilla Bermes Parent of a P.S. 111 student and PTA executive member; Ms. Bermes read an official
statement from the P.S. 111 PTA Executive Board which asked for DOE to prepare an
EIS which ensures that P.S. 111 parents have all of the crucial information regarding a
middle school co-location. The PTA Executive Board stands firmly with parents to have
this request met.
Ms. Bermes, speaking from a personal viewpoint, is concerned that Pre-K students will
be located right next to the cafeteria, where four-year-olds will share space with
teenagers.
Grecia Piezzo Parent of P.S. 111 student; Ms. Piezzo is grateful that her child’s skills have grown due
to P.S. 111’s occupational therapy classrooms. The occupational therapy room is
currently able to hold all necessary equipment for students and therapists. The growing
reputation of P.S. 111 is drawing better therapists and educators. Ms. Piezzo believes the
EIS should include an analysis which focuses on special needs children.
Chien Kwok Mr. Kwok is concerned that the middle school that seeks co-location has had two recent
addresses and this would be the third. He asks for due diligence from DOE.
Michael Girimonti Parent of P.S. 111 student in the gifted and talented program; Mr. Girimonti stated that
P.S. 111 was co-located with a middle school in the past. P.S. 111 has been improving
each year after the removal of the middle school.
Julia Day Parent of P.S. 111 kindergarten student; Ms. Day is concerned that the city’s
underutilized space list shows at least four schools which have space for co-location.
Would like to know why P.S. 111 was chosen.
Sarah Noda Parent of two P.S. 111 students; Ms. Noda worked with the principal and PTA to
improve the school in recent years. She is concerned about the EIS not including an
impact analysis and asks DOE to amend with EIS with more information around impact.
Marissa Redanty Co-District Leader for Hell’s Kitchen; is successfully working to help mitigate
homelessness issues in her district. Ms. Redanty advocated for early voting and the
regulation of pedicabs.
Biko Njoke A staff member at Citizens Committee for New York; announced the West Side
Community Fund which would give grants for community gardens, PTAs, and other
small organizations of up to $5000. Grants are exclusively for Chelsea and Hudson
Yards.
Marni Halasa Owner of Red Eye Coffee; they sell 500 cups of coffee a day to the Hudson Yards
community. Announced that they are closing because they were unable to reach a deal
with their landlord.
Remarks from Elected Officials and Representatives
Sgt. Stefanovich Community Sergeant for Hell’s Kitchen; Sgt. Stefanovich and his team of Neighborhood
Coordination Officers who patrol the neighborhood introduced themselves.
Neighborhood Coordination Officer program in Hell’s Kitchen started in October 2018.
Assemblymember Assemblymember Rosenthal is hopeful that the next legislative session in the assembly
Linda Rosenthal will pass the following pieces of legislation: Child Victims Act, Gender Expression Non-
Discrimination Act (GENDA), an update to the Reproductive Health Act; NYS DREAM
Act, increase education funding, and enact tougher rent control laws.
Senator Brad Senator Hoylman expressed appreciation to be in Hartley House for the board meetingHoylman and thanked all of those who helped save the building. He listed the new State Senate
priorities for 2019, some which include: passing an updated Reproductive Health Act;
voting reform by enacting early voting, automatic voter reg, same day voter reg, and
allowing 16-year-olds to vote; strengthening gun laws; passing the Child Victims Act;
outlawing conversion therapy; finding alternative revenue for the MTA.

BP Gale Brewer  The office is continuing to work with the EDC and stakeholders to ensure that we
preserve as much garment manufacturing square footage as possible through the
building acquisition and IDA program.

rate housing for the proposed new construction at Harborview. She stands with
NYCHA tenants and community members in their demands.
 The newly-imposed community board term limits affects those who are

terms starting on April 1, 2019, regardless of how many years they have already
been on the Board.
 The office is now accepting applications for new and returning community board
members. The applications can be found online as well as in paper format. The
submission deadline is 5 pm on February 8th.
 The office coordinated an inter-Community Board taskforce to discuss the L train
shutdown and held a meeting on November 27th with NYPD, MTA and the
Mayor’s Office to discuss issues of traffic and parking permitting and
enforcement during the L-Train Tunnel reconstruction. Issues surrounding
blockage and enforcement of the 12th and 13th Street bike lanes were also
discussed.
 The NYC Department of Education has been awarded close to 400 million
dollars thanks to the Smart Schools Bond Act. The office has collected data from
more than 80 co-located schools on their broadband speeds, the results of which
will be released shortly.
 The BP funds grants for capital projects for schools, libraries, parks, street
improvement projects and non-profits that contract with the City. One should
contact the Budget team to arrange a one-on-one meeting.
 The Manhattan Cultural Tourism program opened on December 3rd.
 This year’s diaper drive is now active to help low-income parents acquire diapers.
Donations can be made through Amazon or directly at the BP office at 431 West

partners from the Teen Relationship Abuse Prevention Program.

Robert Atterbury With Democrats taking the majority in the House of Representatives, Congressman

Affordable Care Act, expanding the enforcement of hate crimes, civil rights, and defense
of civil liberties. He also advocates for 9/11 victim’s compensation, the Equality Act, and
ending forced arbitration for workers.
Carl Wilson for Mr. Wilson announced that the City Council passed 18 bills to protect rent-regulated
Council Speaker tenants. He thanked CB4 for their partnership in strengthening zoning language against
Cory Johnson illegal demolitions. The Speaker’s office is inspecting intense rodent activity which will
lead to a larger sanitation discussion. There were heat and hot water disruptions at the
Elliot-Chelsea Houses on Thanksgiving Day, which the office deemed unacceptable.They are meeting with other elected officials and NYCHA staff to resolve these issues
and ensure no future disruptions. The Mayor’s Office for People with Disabilities is
working to make buildings more accessible. The Speaker’s Office is working with Holy
Apostles for a holiday toy drive; there will be a pop-up District Office at Penn South to
learn about district services, events, and issues.
Board Reports & Business
Adoption of Agenda and The Agenda, as amended to include Item 22, was unanimously approved. The
Minutes November minutes, as amended, were also approved unanimously.
District Manager Report Highlights of events the District Manager or Staff attended on behalf of the
board and upcoming events:
Meetings/events attended by CB4 staff on behalf of the board:
 District Manager provided testimony at City Council hearing on
Garment Center District Rezoning
 Three Planning Fellows continue to work on their Committee projects
December Committee Updates and Board Reminders:

of the Holy Apostles on 9th Avenue on January 2nd.
Mr. Bodine thanked Nelly Gonzalez and Janine Pretente for their help keeping
the board running so smoothly.
Board Chair Report We had several small meetings during the previous month:
 Construction noise off-hours were the main issues around 415 Tenth
Avenue and 441 Ninth Avenue. At 415, excavation work was originally
permitted by DOB to be performed 24/7. Working with Speaker
Johnson's office, we got the DOB to pull the permits. At 441, the
developers agreed not to do any Saturday work until the New Year.
 The CB4 PABT Working Group continues to work with all the
stakeholders as the bus terminal replacement project moves forward.
 HHHS/CLU had a conference call with HPD and the sponsor of the Till
Buildings on Seventh Avenue and West 22nd Street, AAFE, about the
proposed building's façade. The ULURP will begin sometime in the first
two months of 2019.
 The Chair, the co-chairs of CLU and one committee member, and the
DM met with the developers of a project between West 23rd and West
24th Streets incorporating the deconsecrated French St. Vincent de Paul
church. The developers presented details of their currently as of right
(zoning is part commercial and part manufacturing) hotel/residential
project. We considered the design respectful of the church and
contextual with its surroundings. The issue is the imminent new hotel
zoning and the vote at the City Council, the timing of which prevents afull Board review. The project is consistent with the Board's previous
positions on the church's restoration and mixed-use developments on
West 24th Street.
 The Chair announced the appointment of Brett Firfer to lead a working
group on the latest NYC charter review. Each committee in December is
being asked to consider items covered by the charter that it would like
changed and send them to Brett. The Charter Review Working Group
will then sift through the suggestions and create a document to bring
before the full Board. Eventually we will send our adopted resolution to
the Charter Review Commission.
 Also, the Chair asked for volunteers to work with him on creating a
small business of the month program. This would go towards
implementing one of the recommendations of the MCB4 Business
Diversity Task Force. Chris LeBron volunteered.
Election of Board Officers Frank Holozubiec, Chair of the Nominating Committee, read the list of members
who were nominated for office, noting that all were uncontested. Each officer
was elected by a majority of the votes cast by the 35 members in attendance.
