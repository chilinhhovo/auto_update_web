2PUBLIC SESSION
Proposed construction of the tower in Gansevoort Square, opposed:
• Elisabeth Tiso: Disagrees with process by which this project is being vetted, as well as
the inclusion of the out-of-scale proposed tower. The project should be blocked.
Concerned that constructing a large residential tower without including additional schools
and amenities. Concerned about the impacts on the Community of the expansion of
tourism and of the Whitney Museum. The public should have input on what will be
constructed on city-owned property.
• Zack Winestine: The December presentation was the first time the community had heard
about this project. CB2 should do all it can to delay this proposal so the Community can
be heard. It is outrageous that the city is trying to jam an RFP through only a month after
the proposal was presented. The proposed proportion of market-rate housing is
unacceptable on City-owned land. There was no Community involvement in the creation
of this proposal. Only the Whitney Museum was involved at that time.
• Andrew Berman: Speaking on behalf of Village Preservation about the proposed
Gansevoort construction. Project has not engaged in community consultation, this is
steamrolling. Appreciates that CB2 is pushing back on the timelines. Planned housing
component is going to be overwhelmingly luxury units, not affordable housing. The
tower should only be between 1/4 and 1/2 of the proposed height to be contextually
appropriate. This is public land, with no acquisition cost. There should be a higher
standard for how such land is used. Furthermore, the City has been inconsistent in its
promises around affordability and development timelines in this project versus 388
Hudson. City must slow down the process, reduce the height of the proposed building,
and remove all luxury housing from Gansevoort Square.
• Vera: Echos the sentiments of the Village Preservation. Believes that a City-owned lot
should be treated with a different process, instead of being rushed through over the
holidays.
• Lannyl Stephens: Difficult to comprehend how out-of-scale is this proposed building.
[Shares specifications of local buildings to illustrate this disparity.] This development
would be more than 25% as dense as any local comparison point.
• Sam Moskowitz: Important to understand what is meant by affordable in this context.
Only 25% affordability has been proposed, which would be accessible to those making
60% of AMI. The median income in NYC is actually below 60% AMI. That means that
75% of the building would be affordable to only the very rich, and the remaining 25% of
units would be only limited in affordability.
• Julie Goldscheid: Is a 35+ year resident of the West Village. Outraged at the proposal.
This is not the way to expand affordable housing in our residential neighborhood. This
once-quiet neighborhood is already overcrowded with tourists. Welcomes truly
affordable housing, but this proposal promises to destroy the neighborhood and
contribute to the income inequality that is already threatening to make our neighborhood
unaffordable
3• Joyce Goldzman: Strongly opposes the City’s rushed plan to use public land to benefit
real estate/business interests, at the expense of the residents of the West Village and the
Meatpacking District. The 600’ tower is wildly out of character with the Historic
Meatpacking District and the West Village. The affordable housing will be minimal and
barely affordable, and the luxury housing will be primarily purchased as real estate
investments and/or second, third, fourth, fifth, etc., homes – and thus will largely be un-
lived-in and infrequently even visited – rather than adding new neighbors to the
character of the neighborhood. Asks that CB2 insist that the City postpone the RFP for
this project until after there has been meaningful consultation with the Community.
• Josh Spodek: The building as proposed would lower property values for the whole
neighborhood, as well as damage the character that makes it desirable.
• Melissa Krawitz: The Tower plan must go, and the process slowed down.
• Anna Shapiro: Opposes with conditions. Tall buildings are changing the character of
the neighborhood, which has been attractive to generations of people for its low-rise
nature. Manhattan is already too dense, including the West Village at its north end,
where at times it is difficult even to walk. There is a great deal of luxury housing
already, and even the new 'middle-class' housing is too expensive for most. What is
needed is LOW INCOME housing as infill projects. Further, Gansevoort Street and
Square is the site of the very first greenmarket in New York, before Union Square
became the central locus. The qualities that made it possible, and vestiges of the meat
market for which the area is named, have been disappearing and should not be further
effaced. The tower plan can only help developers, not ordinary citizens.
• Paula Singer: The City is rushing to invite developers to bid on this project just a few
weeks from now, in January. Urges CB2 to ask the City to delay issuing this Request for
Proposals until there has been time for adequate community input, and for that input to
be incorporated into the plans.
Lenox Health Greenwich Village, expansion of services on site
• Maliq Mendez: Represents community relations at Lenox Health. LHGV has expanded
the services available at its site at Seventh Avenue and West 12th – 13th Streets, including
the addition of state-of-the-art cardiac catheterization labs, labs to support the emergency
procedure suite, and inpatient recovery facilities. The Community is invited to an Open
House event on January 30th from 6pm to 8pm.
Recognition of various CB2 committees
• Darlene Lutz: Recognizes the Outdoor Dining Working Group and the SLA-1 and -2
Committees for their good work throughout the year. Also thanks to Will Benesh for his
work with SAPO.
ADOPTION OF AGENDA
The agenda was adopted by acclamation.

District:
• Office will be closed on December 25-27.

statement.
o C. Flynn asks for clarification on whether S563 pertains to rent control or rent
stabilization.
o L. Rakoff asks if the designated businesses get anything more than recognition.
Sharif will follow up with additional details.
o Dr. Smith asks who selected the businesses. Sharif explains that it was an internal
process.

• On December 11, Senator Hoylman-Sigal's bill requiring private insurers to cover
dyslexia exams was signed into law.

United Healthcare CEO, as he was shot with a form of ghost gun.
• Report is accessible at the meeting.
5• Groundbreaking will be taking place on the new LGBTQ+ museum on the UWS. Should
be completed in a couple of years. The Senator secured $9 million to support this project.

required local community input on hospital closures.
• AM Glick is also disappointed that the Governor vetoed a bill protecting horseshoe crabs.
• Q / A

him.

Medicare, and not just to Medicare Advantage. The Mayor is continuing to push for
reimburse only the premiums for mandatory Medicare Advantage plans.
• Update: the Community lawsuit seeking to eliminate a transfer fee for artists' lofts in
SoHo/NoHo was successful.
• City of Yes for Housing Opportunity passed the Council, 31 in favor, 20 opposed. CM
Marte voted against the proposal on grounds that it did not insufficiently require new
housing that would be built to be affordable, and that the plan remained a giveaway to
developers. Believes that the community deserves better and is continuing to advocate
for these needs.

Rivera’s Office, District 2:
• CM Rivera secured funding to support Latinx studies.

applicable regulations, including but not limited to cannabis law, state regulations, zoning,
historic preservation, and security requirements, to be considered viable. The applicant’s failure
to respond to outreach, and the significant concerns raised by the community make this
application unsuitable for approval.

3. Resolution to Deny the Application for Metro Heights LLC, 650 Broadway 10012
1. WHEREAS, on November 15, 2024, Community Board 2 (CB2) received a Notification
to Municipality (NTM) form OCM-06009 for an Adult-Use Retail Dispensary License for
Metro Heights LLC, signed by Makayla Berry, proposing to locate at 650 Broadway, New
York, NY 10012; and
2. WHEREAS, the proposed premises are situated on the east side of Broadway between
Bleecker and Bond Streets in CB2’s NoHo neighborhood; and
3. WHEREAS, WHEREAS, the the applicant, Metro Heights LLC, failed to respond to
outreach efforts, submit a questionnaire, hours, provide any materials or substantive
information concerning the proposed business, or appear before the CB2 Cannabis
Licensing Committee, which are standard requirements for applications under
consideration by CB2; and
4. WHEREAS, the proposed premises is currently operating as a Wendy’s franchise whose
management is unaware of any pending closure or transition to a dispensary, raising
concerns about the legitimacy and transparency of the application; and
5. WHEREAS, evidence suggests that Metro Heights LLC and its principal, Makayla Berry,
may be fictitious entities, as the contact information provided on the application (phone
number: 248-420-0420) leads to an answering service, and inquiries regarding Ms. Berry
or the application resulted in confusion and an apparent lack of knowledge about the
individual and dispensary application; and
6. WHEREAS, further investigation revealed that the applicant was associated with three
separate applications for a single address in CB1, pointing to potential irregularities and a
lack of credibility in the application process; and
7. WHEREAS, the investigation traced connections to several entities based in Michigan,
including Canna Zoned MLS LLC, Hydra Real Estate Development, Vannabis Property
Brokers, Cannabis Property Brokers (malware website) and Cannabis Pro, which appear to
be part of a broader real estate scheme rather than a legitimate dispensary business; and
8. WHEREAS, efforts to contact related parties via the applicant’s listed address, 2207
Orchard Lake Rd. Sylvan Lake, MI 48320, led to a phone number for one of the businesses
listed above which was answered by an individual listed as the applicant on one of the CB1
applications, yet yielded no substantive response, further demonstrating a lack of good faith
engagement with CB2 or the community;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, Community Board 2 (CB2) strongly recommends the
denial of the Adult-Use Retail Dispensary License application for Metro Heights LLC, 650
Broadway 10012 due to the extensive and documented issues outlined, and, and that this decision
shall be deemed part of the record upon which the Office of Cannabis Management (Office) makes
its recommendation to the Cannabis Control Board (Board) to grant or deny the application per
§76 section 4 of NYS Cannabis Law.
13BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that due to the applicant’s failure to provide required
information, the apparent lack of legitimacy of the application, and concerns regarding potential
misrepresentation; CB2 urges the Office of Cannabis Management (OCM) to investigate the
irregularities in this application and ensure that future applications are vetted thoroughly to
maintain transparency and integrity in the licensing process.
Vote: Passed with 35 Board Members in favor, 2 abstentions (R. Kessler, J. Liff), 1 recusal (M.
Metzger).
4. Resolution Regarding Public Convenience and Advantage
WHEREAS:
1. The New York State Office of Cannabis Management (OCM) and Cannabis Control Board
(CCB) have proposed amendments to regulations (Part 118 and 119)1 affecting retail
dispensary proximity and waivers for public convenience and advantage (PCA);
2. These proposed regulations eliminate previously established standards, introduce
ambiguities in distance measurement methods, and redefine PCA criteria without sufficient
clarity;
3. The Proposed amendment to the regulations was posted to the New York State Register
Issue 43 Vol. XLVI Division of Administrative Rules2. on October 23, 2024 and will close
following a 60-day public comment period on December 23, 2024;
4. Community stakeholders, elected officials from Community District 2, and licensed
cannabis operators have raised concerns about the potential impact of these changes on
local businesses, community saturation, and equitable access.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that Community Board 2 recommends the following criteria
be incorporated into any amendments to Public Convenience and Advantage law and regulations;
1. Measurement Clarity:
1. Specify a consistent methodology for measuring distances between dispensaries,
reinstating the door-to-door linear method as the standard to prevent arbitrary
interpretations.
2. Geographic barriers only justify exceptions in narrowly defined and extraordinary
circumstances.
2. Criteria for PCA Waivers:
1. Clear, specific standards for PCA waivers are reinstated to ensure consistent application
and prevent arbitrary decision-making.
2. Metrics such as quantifiable public demand, the impact on existing legal dispensaries, and
community benefits should be integral to the evaluation criteria.
3. Process Suggestions:
1. Develop and publish an official PCA guidance document for applicants, licensees, and
municipalities, outlining clear instructions and covering specific topics such as criteria,
application steps, and decision-making processes.

2
https://dos.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2024/10/102324.pdf
142. Establish and maintain a publicly available list of criteria used by the OCM and CCB to
evaluate PCA applications, ensuring transparency and accountability in the vetting process.
3. Provide a centralized PCA application form or online portal for submission, detailing key
requirements and steps involved in the process.
4. Extend the 45-day municipal comment deadline to 75 days if municipalities formally
request an extension, outlining how this extension process will work in practice.
5. Ensure transparency by publicly disclosing the rationale behind approvals or denials of
PCA applications, particularly for decisions made prior to the finalization of regulations.
6. Address applicant confusion about PCA requirements by creating instructional resources
and direct outreach programs to guide them through the application and waiver process.
7. Incorporate feedback mechanisms for municipalities and community boards to improve
coordination and ensure their input is reflected in final decisions.
8. Require applicants to submit all pertinent documentation, including detailed PCA requests
and waiver rationales, alongside their Notice to Municipality forms to ensure compliance
and completeness.
4. Equity and Market Integrity:
1. The prevalence of illicit dispensaries should not be used as justification for PCA waivers,
as this conflates regulated market needs with unlawful activity.
2. Protections for small, local businesses must be strengthened to prevent market
oversaturation and domination by larger entities.
5. Operational Transparency:
1. PCA waiver applications must include comprehensive disclosures, such as financial
viability, operational plans, and potential community impacts.
2. The OCM must publicly disclose PCA decisions and provide clear rationales for approvals
or denials.
6. Notification and Review Timeline:
1. Any dispensary location changes or PCA waiver approvals made after initial municipal
consent must be resubmitted for review to account for significant changes in the local
landscape.
7. Local Adaptability:
1. The regulations should recognize the unique geographic and demographic considerations
of urban areas like New York City. Provisions must address challenges such as population
density and transportation barriers.
Immediate Actions Requested
○ Rescind non-compliant Notice to Municipality (NTM) forms submitted for locations that
fail to meet the 1,000-foot minimum distance requirement.
○ Require applicants to resubmit updated NTM forms, including a detailed PCA waiver
request submitted to the state.
○ Notify municipalities or community boards that they will have up to 45 days to respond
to notifications prior to board consideration of applications, as stipulated under Section
76 of the Cannabis Law and Section 119.3(b) of the regulations.
15○ Applicants include a copy of the application they intend to submit to the board as part of
their notification.
○ Proof of notification and any municipal responses accompany applications resubmitted
for further review.
Vote: Passed with 35 Board Members in favor, 2 abstentions (R. Kessler, J. Liff), 1 recusal (M.
Metzger).
Discussion concerning the Cannabis Licensing Committee Resolutions:
M. Fitzgerald: One Board member regularly leaves the room whenever Cannabis Licensing
Committee resolutions are presented and votes on such resolutions are taken, raising a question
about how votes were being tallied for such resolutions.
The Chair inquired whether the CLC Chair wished to have a roll call vote to replace the roll call
attendance and vote already taken at the beginning of the Business Session. The CLC Chair
declined to so move, and the meeting continued.
JOINT PARKS & WATERFRONT AND TRAFFIC & TRANSPORTATION
1. Resolution concerning NYC Council Intro. 0060-2024.
Whereas NYC Council bill Intro 0060-2024 proposes to amend the Administrative Code of the
City of New York (NYC) so that “Operation of an electric scooter, as defined in section 114-e of
the vehicle and traffic law, and operation of a bicycle with electric assist, as defined in section
102-c of the vehicle and traffic law, shall be prohibited in any area of any park under the
jurisdiction of the Department of Parks and Recreation”; and
Whereas Community Board No. 2 Manhattan (CB2) thanks Council Member Vickie Paladino,
the sponsor of the bill, for her presentation concerning the bill; and
Whereas CB2 received many expressions of concern about e-bikes, from both pedestrians and
cyclists, including accounts of being hit by e-bikes and e-scooters and suffering serious injuries
(e.g. the woman struck by an e-bike and partially paralyzed, who was no longer able to work as a
cellist) and worries for the safety of those who can’t move quickly away from speeding e-bikes,
like the disabled, the elderly and children, coupled with their support of the bill; and
Whereas at the same time CB2 received many expressions about the positive benefits of e-bikes
and e-scooters and the benefits e-bikes and e-scooters have brought to them personally, such as
providing an easy way to get around and be outdoors for families and the physically challenged,
like people with injuries, people who are older and less physically strong and the disabled,
coupled with their opposition to the bill; and
Whereas bicycles are already banned from riding and operating in NYC parks by NYC law
(except in rare instances approved by the NYC Parks Commissioner) and from all parks within
16CB2 under the jurisdiction of NYC’s Dept. of Parks and Recreation. (The Mayor’s current pilot
program allows e-bikes and e-scooters on drives and greenways within NYC parks, but no parks
with such byways are located in CB2); and
Whereas there are different types of e-bikes and other motorized two-wheeled vehicles, from e-
bike Class 1 Pedal Assist (20 mph) to e-bike Class 3 Throttle With Pedals (25-28 mph) to Class
C (20 mph) and Class A (40 mph) Mopeds and e-scooters (15 mph), all with varying weights,
and when e-bikes have speed limiters removed, they can go as high as 70 mph. Each needs to be
individually assessed for its potential impact and place in certain locations rather than all of them
broadly addressed; and
Whereas there are many different kinds of parks, from small neighborhood parks (like CB2’s
Jackson Sq. and Vesuvio Playground) and larger local parks (like Washington Square and
Seravalli Park) where children play, older people relax, people stroll, push baby carriages, sit and
socialize and where sometimes space and/or small facilities are available for sports or there is art
and small performances, and their peace, quiet and safety would be compromised by e-bikes, to
large parks with extensive acreage that have drives and greenways (like Central Park) that can
accommodate e-bikes and other motorized vehicles; and
Whereas it was appreciated that the intent of Intro 0060-2024 is to ensure people’s safe,
undisturbed and relaxed enjoyment of NYC parks; and
Whereas it was recognized that although it’s important to regulate the activities and preserve the
sanctuary that these many different parks provide, one size does not fit all; and
Whereas it was understood that there are conflicts and problems with e-bikes (e.g. collisions,
encroachment on pedestrian space, excessive speed), that need to be resolved; and
Whereas it was agreed that the major concern is a lack of enforcement of the laws that already
exist to address these problems and that (before adding another bill) what is imperative is to
strongly enforce such rules by carrying out existing laws and developing additional enforcement
strategies to ensure their success;
Therefore Be It Resolved that CB2 cannot support Intro. 0060-2024.
Vote: Passed, with 35 Board members in favor, 3 against (C. Flynn, R. Sanz, A. Wong).

Whereas:
A. The building is the sole surveying intact house in the extensive row with the facade in the
original three-story configuration with an unusually detailed cornice; and
22B. The facade is in the original brick and the stairs and entry way appear to be original and is to
be restored unchanged with the addition of a stoop gate with automatic closure modeled on the
existing ironwork; and
C. The location is unusually prominent in that it is on and east-west street (Waverly Place) and at

the rear with the remainder of the excavation being benched, and mature trees have been destroyed
in order to accommodate the excavation; and
I. The light gray roof top addition mockup was shown in photographs that showed no visibility
from the sidewalk immediately opposite and clear visibility from a few feet to the north and
extending one block north that exceeds the standard universally applied to rooftop additions on
row houses in the district that they be “not more than minimally visible from a public
thoroughfare”. The committee showed photographs that expectedly showed increased excessive
visibility moving north toward Christopher Street and extensive visibility just after half the
distance up the block; and
J. There was testimony from the public objecting to the removal of mature trees from the garden,
even before permission was given for the excavation of the area and the visibility of the rooftop
addition; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:
A. Approval of the sensitive restoration of the sole surviving front facade in the row and the stoop
gate; and

25LAND USE
Resolution on Gansevoort Meat Market Site Public Process
Whereas:
1. In October 2009 and May 2011, The Whitney Museum and The City of New York
entered into two agreements that have effectively disposed of what is now, in 2024, the
largest known parcel of undeveloped City-owned land in CB2 for the benefit and
expansion of the museum.
2. These transactions were conducted with neither public process nor public notice.
3. Whereas in December 2008, Community Board 2 noted as part of our support of the
original Whitney Development that “WHEREAS, almost any new use on the rest of the
block would come before the Community Board for public review” and that has proven
to not be the case at this time, specifically neither The Whitney, nor The Friends of the
High Line, have presented their plans for this site or discussed exercising the Right of
First Offer for this site, or integrating the proposed housing development on the site; and”
4. The NYC Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC) presented a proposal to
redevelop the Gansevoort Meat Market Site located at 559-573 West Street, aka 44 Little
West 12th Street.
5. A site plan was presented that allocated 38,471sf to a Whitney expansion (effectively
doubling the size of the museum); 6,322sf to an expansion of the Friends of the High
Line headquarters; 11,200sf to open space; and only 10,000sf to a 60-story, 600 unit
residential building that would be developed by NYCEDC and administered under the
485-x program.
6. NYCEDC stated that the housing will comply with the 485-x program, which mandates
that 25% of the units be affordable at an average AMI of 60%. It is EDC’s hope that a
developer will propose a scenario that creates up to 50% affordable units
7. CB2 faces a shortage of publicly owned land in the district.
8. NYCEDC referenced Executive Order 43 with respect to new housing projects under
consideration. On August 21, 2024, Mayor Adams issued Executive Order 43 requiring
city agencies, and other designated bodies to review city-owned and -controlled land for
potential housing development sites.
Therefore be it resolved that CB2 Manhattan:
261. Requests that NYCEDC expand the public review process and timeline so that it is
robust, transparent, and reflective of community input and responds to the long timeline
for the ULURP.
2. Rejects the proposal of only 50% affordability on public land and continues to advocate
for 100% affordable housing.
3. Calls for NYCEDC to slow down the RFP process. The RFP should not be issued until
after: a) the community board has issued a full resolution on Gansevoort Square and b)
the community board has had an opportunity to review and comment on a draft RFP.
4. Requests a report from NYCEDC on its findings from the planned public engagement
sessions on December 19, 2024, and proposed for January 7 and 8, 2025.
5. Requests that NYCEDC share with CB2 all sources of city and state funding for the
affordable housing that have been considered before arriving at the cross-subsidy model.
6. Requests that the redevelopment plans on public land maximize the overall public
benefit, including the development of affordable housing, owing to its relative scarcity in
CB2.
7. Requests that the Mayor’s Office, the City Housing Activation Task Force, NYCEDC
and any other agencies involved immediately and regularly share with CB2 a list of all
sites being considered under Executive Order 43.
8. Requests that NYCEDC make all agreements between The Whitney, Friends of the High
Line, and other involved parties available for public review, including all Right Of First
Offer documentation.
9. Insists that the proposed site plan be considered open for further analysis and review in a
public process.
Vote: Passed, with 29 Board members in favor, 4 abstaining (Z. Kazzaz, J. Liff, B. Listman, E.
Smith), 4 against (C. Dignes, R. Kessler, M. Metzger, E. Siegel).
OUTDOOR DINING WORKING GROUP
November 26, 2024 Meeting
Applications to DOT for a Sidewalk Cafe:
1. Tatane Corp. dba Fiat Cafe, 203 Mott Street, 10013 (Sidewalk)
a. Whereas, the comments related to the roadway cafe setup’s physical footprint and
dimensions:
■ The establishment is located on Mott Street between Spring Street and
Kenmare Street in Nolita;
27■ The sidewalk on Mott Street at this location is 12’ (12 feet) wide;
■ The Applicant/Licensee, Stephane Iacovelli, appeared at the CB2 Outdoor
Dining Working Group meeting on Tuesday, November 26, 2024.
b. Whereas, the comments related to pedestrian flow are as follows:
■ Mott Street is a Regional Corridor requiring a 10-foot clear path;
■ There are two primary building entrances on both sides of the establishment
– 205 Mott Street and 203 Mott Street, which is specifically the primary
building entrance for residents of 203 Mott Street, each which requires a 5’ (5-
foot) clearance to the sidewalk cafe perimeter on both sides;
c. Whereas, the recommended modifications are as follows:
■ Will add the primary building entrance of the adjacent building located at 205
Mott Street to the north of the establishment’s frontage which means labeling
it as a Primary Building Entrance on the site plan;
■ Will illustrate the required 5’ (5-foot) clearance from the Primary Building
Entrance south of the establishment to the proposed sidewalk cafe setup on the
site plan;
■ Will reduce the length of the proposed sidewalk cafe setup from 10’-3” (10
feet, 3 inches) to 7’-1” (7 feet, 1 inch), which takes into account the required

10012 (Sidewalk)
a. Whereas, the comments related to the roadway cafe setup’s physical footprint and
dimensions:
■ The establishment is located on MacDougal Street between Minetta Lane and
West 3rd Street in Greenwich Village, which is in the South Village Historic
District;
■ The sidewalk on MacDougal Street at this location is 11’ (11 feet) wide;
■ The proposed sidewalk cafe setup is:
● MacDougal Street: 6’ (6 feet) length by 2’ (2 feet) width, however, the
length presented on the proposed site plan does not take into account
the required 5’ (5-foot) clearance from the Primary Building Entrance
to the south of the establishment;
■ The Applicant/Licensee, Antonio “Tony” Jiminez, appeared in person at the
CB2 Outdoor Dining Working Group meeting on November 26, 2024;
b. Whereas, the comments related to pedestrian flow are as follows:
■ The establishment is located on MacDougal Street, which as a Regional
Corridor, requires a 10’ (10-foot) clear path on the sidewalk;
■ As long as the sidewalk cafe setup on MacDougal Street does not exceed a
1’ (1-foot) width, the required 10’ (10-foot) clear path will be maintained;
■ However, a 1’ (1-foot) wide sidewalk cafe is not ADA accessible as required
by the Dining Out NYC rules;
30c. Whereas, the comments related to potential conflicts with existing curb use (i.e.
planters, bike racks, bus stops) are as follows:
■ There is a Primary Building Entrance, south of the establishment, which
requires a 5’ (5-foot) clearance to the perimeter of the sidewalk cafe;
■ As long as the sidewalk cafe setup on MacDougal Street does not exceed 3’-
6” (3 feet, 6 inches) in length, it will maintain the required clearance for a
Primary Building Entrance;
d. Whereas, the recommended modifications are as follows:
■ There are no recommended modifications since once the proposed sidewalk
cafe setup takes into account the required 5’ (5-foot) clearance for the Primary
Building Entrance and the required 10’ (10-foot) clear path:
■ The potential size for a sidewalk cafe setup at this location is reduced to: 3’6”
(3 feet, 6 inches) length by 1’ (1 foot) which does not seem reasonable;

Applications to DOT for a Roadway Cafe:
The following applications presented show comments submitted to NYC DOT by the December
12, 2024 and December 18, 2024 comment deadlines:
4. PopUp Bagels Inc. dba PopUp Bagels, 177 Thompson Street, 10012 (roadway)
a. Whereas, the comments related to the roadway cafe setup’s physical footprint and
dimensions:
■ The establishment is located on Thompson Street between Bleecker Street and
West Houston Street in Greenwich Village within the South Village Historic
District;
■ The roadway on Thompson Street at this location is 26’ (26 feet) wide, per the
FDNY letter dated October 31, 2024;
■ The proposed roadway cafe setup on the updated site plan – see Exhibit A –
is: 11’ (11 feet) length by 6’ (6 feet) width, which does not comply with the
required 15-foot emergency lane clearance on Thompson Street, however,
FDNY issued the Applicant/Licensee a waiver dated October 31, 2024 via a
Letter of No Objection which allows for a 12’ (12-foot) travel lane on
Thompson Street, which is based on a 6’ (6-foot) wide roadway cafe;
■ There are inconsistencies, specifically on this block, with how FDNY is
granting waivers, and while the October 31, 2024 Letter of No Objection for
31this Applicant/Licensee stated that a 12’ (12-foot) travel lane, – based on a
roadway cafe width of 6’ (6 feet) – is allowed in absence of the required 15’
(15-foot) travel lane for PopUp Bagels Inc. dba PopUp Bagels, across the
street at 170 Thompson Street, in a similar Letter of No Objection, dated
November 4, 2024 from FDNY to Red Clam LLC dba Lupa Osteria Romana,
Red Clam LLC is allowed to only maintain a 10.5’ (10.5-foot) travel lane on
Thompson Street based on a roadway cafe with a width of 6.5’ (6.5-feet) for
their roadway cafe setup;
■ FDNY waivers should be unilaterally applied, if granted, to maintain the same
travel lane width within the same block across multiple operators instead of
allowing a smaller travel lane just a few feet south of this
Applicant/Licensee’s location and allowing a different operator on the same
street to have a roadway setup that is 0.5’ (0.5 feet) larger than this
Applicant/Licensee’s proposed roadway cafe setup;
■ DOT should coordinate with FDNY to ensure that if FDNY does grant
waivers allowing a reduced travel lane width that the size is uniform across
the entire block for all operators of that block;
■ The updated site plan dated December 4, 2024 indicates there is one area on
the roadway where a roadway cafe is set up:
● Thompson Street: 11’ (11 feet) length by 6’ (6 feet) width;
● The FDNY waiver is contingent upon a proposed roadway cafe width
of 6’ (6 feet) width for this location as stated in the above-referenced
Letter of No Objection;
■ Since June 2023, the establishment has received sixteen (16) 311 complaints,
and twelve (12) of those complaints were noise - commercial and noise -
street/sidewalk complaints that required NYPD to respond and take action to
fix the condition;
■ The Applicant/Licensee’s two representatives, Lisa Potash and Adam
Goldberg, appeared via Zoom at the CB2 Outdoor Dining Working Group
meeting on November 26, 2024;
b. Whereas, the comments related to pedestrian flow are as follows:
■ The proposed roadway cafe will have flooring flush with the sidewalk
ensuring ADA access into the roadway cafe;
c. Whereas, the comments related to potential conflicts with existing curb use (i.e.
planters, bike racks, bus stops) are as follows:
■ The tree bed in the furnishing zone of the sidewalk on Thompson Street in
front of the Applicant/Licensee’s frontage is parallel to the roadway cafe,
which allows for what appears to be limited egress into the proposed roadway
cafe;
■ The tree bed was originally not included on the site plan in package referred to
32CB2 on November 12, 2024, and this continues to be a consistent omission on
roadway cafe applications referred, however, the Applicant/Licensee added it
to the updated site plan dated December 3, 2024;
■ While there is no clearance requirement for tree beds in relation to roadway
cafes, tree beds in the furnishing zone parallel to roadway cafes affect the
means of egress into the roadway cafe from the sidewalk and should be
included on site plans for all roadway cafe applications in order for them to be
considered “complete and accurate” before referral for community board
review;
■ The importance of a service aisle within the roadway cafe due to limited
means of egress from the sidewalk into the roadway cafe;
d. Whereas, the suggested modifications related to the above-referenced application
are:
■ Will reduce the width of the proposed roadway cafe by 6” (6 inches) – from
6’6” (6 feet, 6 inches) as originally proposed to 6’ (6 feet) since the FDNY
based their review of this establishment and subsequently their statement of No
Objection on a proposed roadway cafe width of 6’ (6 feet) on Thompson Street,
which leaves a 12’ (12-foot) travel lane on Thompson Street at this location as
stated in FDNY’s letter dated October 31, 2024;
■ Will add the tree bed on Thompson Street that is in front of the establishment’s
frontage in the furnishing zone to site plan so the site plan is complete and
accurate;
■ Will adjust the clearance from the manhole cover on Thompson Street to the
required 18” (18 inches) instead of the 13” (13 inches) shown on the site plan
included in the CB2 referral package for this application from DOT, and ensure
that the adjusted roadway cafe width of 6’ (6 feet) is in compliance with the
required 18” (18 inches) clearance from the manhole cover;
■ Will update 2nd page of the Dining Out NYC Roadway Cafe Site Plan Form to
indicate the manhole cover is present at the site by checking off R-18-Manholes
and indicating the measurement (inches) of the clearance from the manhole to
roadway cafe setup in the blank next to R-18;
■ Will add the primary building entrance of the adjacent building to the left
(south) of the establishment’s frontage which means labeling it as a Primary
Building Entrance on the site plan;
■ Will add the primary building entrance of the adjacent building to the right
(north) of the establishment’s frontage which means labeling it as a Primary
Building Entrance on the site plan;
■ Will add the required North Arrow to the site plan in order to comply with the
drawing requirements listed on the DOT Roadway Cafe Site Plan Form;
■ Will submit an updated site plan with the modifications above to CB2, Man.
and upload the updated site plan to the Dining Out NYC application portal;
33■ Will appear before CB2, Man. prior to submitting any changes to any
modifications agreed to herein.

foot) parking lane leaves 10’-6” (10 feet, 6 inches) for the emergency travel
lane;
■ There was significant testimony in opposition to the FDNY waiver from a
resident on the block citing a fire at 104-106 Sullivan Street on Memorial Day
2023 that resulted in the passing of two longtime neighborhood residents
along with issues that emergency personnel had in gaining access to the site
40from the roadway;
■ The Applicant/Licensee, Nicola Zanata, appeared in person at the CB2
Outdoor Dining Working Group meeting on November 26, 2024;
b. Whereas, the comments related to pedestrian flow are as follows:
■ The importance of a service aisle within the roadway cafe due to limited
means of egress;
■ The proposed roadway cafe flooring is at grade with the roadway with no
raised floor or additional flooring material;
■ ADA access into the roadway cafe due to one means of egress and the
placement of tables within the roadway cafe to allow for a temporary ADA
ramp to be used as needed was also questioned;
c. Whereas, the comments related to potential conflicts with existing curb use (i.e.
planters, bike racks, bus stops) are as follows:
■ There is a manhole cover located within the roadway cafe setup which
requires a 1’-6” (1 foot, 6 inches) clearance from the obstruction;
d. Whereas, the suggested modifications related to the above-referenced application
are:
■ Will indicate on the site plan where a ramp (whether temporary or permanent)
is to be located for patrons who require such accommodation to move from
the sidewalk on Sullivan Street in front of the establishment to the roadway
cafe setup since there is no flooring proposed for the roadway cafe setup;
Therefore Be It Resolved, Manhattan CB2 recommends submitting the comments as
stated above regarding the Dining Out NYC roadway cafe for Sorate Soho Corp. dba Sorate
at 103 Sullivan Street, 10012.

2. Andreas WV LLC dba Da Andrea, 35 West 13th Street, 10011 (Sidewalk)
a. Whereas, the comments regarding this application are as follows:
■ Acknowledges that as of the date of the CB2 hearing for this application
– December 10, 2024 – the establishment was operating a sidewalk cafe past
November 1, 2024 that was not in compliance with the Dining Out NYC
rules:
■ Acknowledges that the current sidewalk setup as of December 10, 2024 had a
sidewalk cafe width of 5’-2” (5 feet, 2 inches) on West 13th Street where the
sidewalk width measures 12’-6” (12 feet, 6 inches), leaving a clear path of 7’-
4” (7 feet, 4 inches), which falls 2’-6” (2 feet, 6 inches) short of the required
10-foot clear path for West 13th Street, which is classified as a regional
corridor in the NYC DOT Pedestrian Mobility Plan;
■ Acknowledges that the current sidewalk setup as of December 10, 2024 was
fully enclosed with a storm enclosure extending the entire width and length of
the sidewalk cafe setup, which does not comply with the Dining Out NYC
rules that state on the Dining Out NYC website that “A sidewalk cafe may not
be fully enclosed,” and specifically, this location’s setup was confirmed by
DOT’s Director of Public Engagement as “Enclosures are not allowed” when
inquiring about storm enclosures on sidewalk cafes;
■ Acknowledges that this establishment did not have an existing, permitted,
enclosed sidewalk cafe in operation prior to March 16, 2020 or four years

cafe and roadway cafe must be directly accessible to persons with physical
disabilities. The design of such cafe shall comply with applicable
requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act and rules promulgated
thereunder, and applicable requirements of the New York City Building
Code.”
■ Acknowledges that a sidewalk cafe cannot be accessible if less than 36” (36
inches) or 3’ (3 feet), according to ADA and the New York City Building
Code;
■ Acknowledges that the proposed sidewalk cafe width of 2’-5” (2 feet, 5
inches) or 29” (29 inches) falls short of what ADA and the New York City
Building Code deem as accessible and attempting to maintain the ADA
standard 5% of outdoor seating as accessible is impossible to achieve as the
setup is currently presented on the site plan sent to CB2;
■ Acknowledges that the required 10’ (10-foot) clear path on West 13th Street at
this location leaves no options to site a sidewalk cafe with an ADA-compliant
width of 36” (36 inches) because compliance with ADA would leave a clear
43path of 9.5’ (9 .5 feet), falling 0.5’ (0.5 feet) short of the required 10-foot clear
path;
Whereas, Manhattan CB2 recommends denial of the Dining Out NYC sidewalk cafe for

i. Whereas, the Applicant and the Applicant’s Attorney appeared to present an application to
the NYS Liquor Authority for an On-Premises Restaurant Liquor License for a Mexican
restaurant offering both a typical Mexican restaurant experience and a Taco “Omakase”
experience located in the cellar floor of a six (6)-story commercial building (c. 1896, altered
1989) on Bleecker Street between Mott and Mulberry Streets with the primary entrance on
privately gated Jones Alley on the north side which is accessed via Lafayette St. (Block
#529/Lot #62), the building falling within the NoHo East Historic District; and
ii. Whereas, the cellar premises is approximately 4,655 sq. ft., the primary cellar entrance being
accessed via a private gated access on Jones Alley not accessible to the public but is a shared
service-only access for all buildings which back onto the alleyway which is accessed from
62Lafayette Street and a second emergency egress on Bleecker Street, the Applicant intending
to use the entryway on Jones Alley only for all patron and employee ingress and egress and
trash collection; there are 31 tables and 70 seats with two (2) bars and fifty seats for a total
interior seated occupancy of 120 persons, the temporary certificate of occupancy presented

events only as the years went on, with its entry on Bleecker Street only and having agreed
upon and executed an extensive stipulation agreement with NoHo Bowery Stakeholders
which incorporated hours of trash pickup and guidelines for mitigating noise from patrons on
Bleecker Street; and
v. Whereas, it came as a surprise to both CB2’s SLA Committee and members of the public
that the Applicant intended to use Jones Alley as its means of ingress and egress for all of the
activities of the restaurant, the Applicant stating that was a quiet and discreet entryway with
there currently being a taxi area on Lafayette Street where patrons can enter the gated and
locked Jones Alley and walk East on the block to reach the restaurant entrance; a number of
residents that live in the immediate vicinity of the premises came to speak in opposition to the
application stating there was no outreach to the adjacent and nearby residential buildings that
both share the alleyway and that overlook the alleyway, the Applicant supplying a letter that
they had sent to various block associations about the instant application, that letter failing to
mention that the proposed entry would be on Jones Alley and not Bleecker Street as the
previous operator had done, residents also citing that while the premises are located in a
commercial building the surrounding buildings are both mixed-use and residential with
residential-only buildings both adjacent and across Jones Alley, many of those residents
having bedrooms that face Jones Alley specifically because it is quiet and a service alley only
not accessible to the public; quality of life concerns were raised due to noise of patrons leaving
in the later hours combined with the large size of the restaurant, that there was no specific
trash plan regarding hours of trash pick-up nor a specific plan to manage the crowd aside from
managers watching Jones Alley and posting of signs to “Respect the Neighbors”, in addition
it was unclear how access to Jones Alley would be achieved, there being a locked gate on
Lafayette Street which is kept closed, the Alley not being either a car of pedestrian
thoroughfare; and
vi. Whereas, after hearing the concerns of the residents and the issues regarding the use of Jones
Alley, the Applicant requesting during the SLA Licensing Committee meeting to lay over this
63application to January/2025, further notifying CB2, Manhattan on the day of its December
full board meeting of their intention to withdraw the application all together, affirming that
they will not submit this application to the NYSLA for consideration without returning to
CB2 Manhattan should they decide to proceed at some time in the future; and
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that Community Board 2, Manhattan strongly recommends
that the NYSLA deny any type of proposed on-premises liquor license, tavern wine license,
restaurant wine license, any other beer and wine license, corporate change, change in method of
operation, alteration, transfer or other changes to any existing license for Casamata LLC 45
Bleecker St 10012 until the Applicant has presented their application in front of CB2’s SLA
Licensing Committee and CB2 has forwarded a recommendation to the NYSLA and requests that
the NYSLA send this Applicant back to CB2 should this application proceed directly to the
NYSLA, in order that this important step not be avoided and that the concerns of the Community

5. 343 Broome Tomorrow LLC 146 Bowery 10013 (OP–Restaurant) (Transfer)
i. Whereas, the Applicant, the Applicant’s architect and the Applicant’s Attorney appeared to
present an application to the NYS Liquor Authority for an On-Premises Restaurant Liquor
License for a restaurant serving Algerian/Sicilian cuisine located in the ground floor and cellar
67floor of a four (4)-story hotel/SRO building (c. 1915, altered 2013) on Bowery between
Broome and Grand Streets (Block #470/Lot #50) the building falling within the designated
Special Little Italy District; and
ii. Whereas, the ground floor storefront premises is approximately 4,175 sq. ft. (1,900 sq. ft. in
the cellar and 2,245 sq. ft. in the ground floor) with 20 tables and 65 seats and one bar with 10
seats on the ground floor and 12 tables and 38 seats and one bar with 10 seats in the cellar for
a total seated patron occupancy of 123 persons, the Applicant was unable to produce a valid
certificate of occupancy for the basement portion of the premises and there is a question as to
the current occupancy already being utilized by other licensed premises on those floors in the
building, there is no sidewalk café and no backyard use included with this application but there
will be a future application for a significant number of tables and chairs on the exterior; and
iii. Whereas, the hours of operation will be from 12 PM to 12 AM Sundays through Thursdays
and 12 PM to 2 AM Fridays and Saturdays; the Applicant stating the establishment will be a
restaurant on both the ground floor and cellar, music will be quiet background only consisting
of music from iPod/CDs; there will be no dancing, DJs, live music, promoted events, no
scheduled performances or cover fees, no velvet ropes, no movable barriers; and
iv. Whereas, the premises has been licensed as Bowery Restaurant Group LLC operating under
several names, most recently dba Casa Bocado, Escondido (Lic. ID #0340-22-106549, SN
#1268378) since approximately 2014 against the objections of CB2, Manhattan, the SLA
originally denying the application but issuing a license after reconsideration, this instant
application being a transfer of assets from Bowery Restaurant Group LLC to 343 Broome
Tomorrow LLC; and
v. Whereas, the Applicant and his Attorney appeared before CB2, Man. in November/2024 and
requested to lay their application over until December/2024 due to many questions that were
raised about the application at that time, the Applicant also being the owner of the building
which is one of the earliest hotels in the city, the most recent certificate of occupancy (dated
02/05/2007) not allowing for the existing eating and drinking establishment on the ground
floor and basement, at the time of the issuance of the liquor license to Bowery Restaurant
Group LLC the NYSLA was requiring all Applicants to have a proper certificate of occupancy
for eating and drinking for the licensed premises prior to the issuance of the liquor license,
therefore it is questionable whether the license should have been issued in the first place
because there is no allowed use of the basement portion of the premises for eating and drinking
purposes, the Applicant to date not able to get a temporary or permanent certificate of
occupancy for eating and drinking on the basement premises, there is no occupancy listed for
the cellar on the certificate of occupancy, there is a place of assembly for the first floor but
the cellar and ground floor of the instant application are connected internally and operate as
one premise with one means of egress and with a capacity of over 74 persons, requiring a
place of assembly for the cellar and ground floor combined; it being a reasonable conclusion
that the SLA issued the original liquor license for the entire premises for Bowery Restaurant
Group LLC and both bars on both floors in error due to the lack of a proper certificate of
occupancy for the basement; and
68vi. Whereas, the previous operator Bowery Restaurant Group LLC had several corporate
changes and for many years, while not cited by the SLA for violations, operated in derogation
of the imposed conditions on their license and later agreed upon stipulations, those operations
including operating as a club in the basement, operating as two separate premises with
different dba’s, allowing dancing and entertainment level music in the basement, utilizing
DJ’s, utilizing promoters, utilizing separate entrances for the basement, utilizing cover
charges, not utilizing reservation seating only in basement, operating with over 50 patrons in
the basement, operating beyond the stipulated closing hours; and
vii. Whereas, additional concerns were raised regarding the number of liquor licenses in the entire
building, there being four other active licenses within the building, the ground floor of the
building consisting primarily of eating and drinking establishments with liquor licenses where
there used to be dry retail uses, the combined capacity within all the licensed premises being
close to 700 persons, in addition there is a billiards establishment located on Elizabeth St
which recently closed which was operated as a club with an accompanying large unlicensed
basement space which has caused quality of life problems over the years with the community
with violations issued by the SLA, the architect appeared showing plans going back to 2017
for bringing the building into compliance yet no changes to the Certificate of Occupancy have
been made and no Temporary Certificate of Occupancy having been issued to date allowing
those uses, concerns were raised that the same issues have been going on for over ten years
and none have been corrected, there currently being numerous active DOB violations on the
building; and
vii. Whereas, additional concerns were raised regarding the combined large capacity and late
hours of the application, there having never been permits in place to legally operate with
patron occupancy in the basement ever, the premises having caused negative quality of life
issues for residents in the past and operating in derogation of their stipulations by having DJs
and dancing in the cellar and other issues as outlined above, the instant application being a
transfer of assets which includes space that is not and has never been legal to operate, it being
questionable whether this is a true transfer of assets given the prior operator went out of
business, the Applicant stating they will operate in the same manner as the current licensee,
albeit abiding by the stipulations and operating strictly as a restaurant only, not a lounge, on
both floors; and
viii. Whereas, the Applicant and his representative stating they were seeking the transfer of the
license as opposed to applying for a new license once they could provide a temporary
certificate of occupancy in order to have the ability to get a temporary liquor license with the
2 AM closing time, those hours being the most problematic to the community and not aligning
with the hours of other restaurants in the neighborhood, additionally raising doubts that the
proper DOB certificates will be obtained, there being a question as to how a liquor license
that included the cellar premises without the proper DOB permits and therefore never should
have been issued can be transferred; and
ix. Whereas, this application being subject to the 500 Foot Rule requiring the Applicant to
demonstrate that the public interest would be served by the granting of the on-premises liquor
69license at this location, there being 86 active licensed premises within 750 ft. and 7 pending
licenses according to LAMP, there being no proper certificate of occupancy for eating and
drinking at the licensed premises, the instant application not illustrating that the granting of
this license is in the public interest but instead would just permit the continued operation of a
licensed premises without proper permits and thereby causing life safety risks to its patrons;
and
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that Community Board 2, Manhattan recommends denial of
the application for an On-Premises Liquor License for 343 Broome Tomorrow LLC 146 Bowery
10013; and
THEREFORE BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that should this application be considered by
the NYSLA, CB2, Manhattan respectfully requests that this item be calendared to appear before
the Full Board of the NYSLA.

On-Premises Restaurant Liquor License to operate a family run wood fire Italian restaurant

the buildings falling within the Special Little Italy District; and
ii. Whereas, the Applicant re-notified CB2, Manhattan of a change in licensee name to Dante

and notarizing the same stipulation agreement that was executed and notarized in March/2024
under the new licensee name, appearance being waived at this month’s SLA #1 Committee
meeting; and
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that Community Board 2, Manhattan recommends denial of

iv. Whereas, the premises had previously never been licensed for the service of alcohol and has
been vacant for approximately the past ten (10) years; and
v. Whereas, the Applicant having appeared before CB2, Manhattan in July/2024 with this same
application, concerns being raised at the time that there was no Certificate of Occupancy or
Letter of No Objection showing that the use of the rear yard was permitted and therefore CB2,
Manhattan could not recommend approval of the tavern wine license, the Applicant laying
over the application in July in order to do further research of the use of the rear yard and
withdrawing the application in August/2024; and
vi. Whereas, there already are a significant number of licensed establishments in both Community
Board 2 and in the immediate area, there being 65 active licensed premises within 750 feet
of the proposed premises according to LAMP to be licensed and an additional 4 pending
licenses within this same area, this application being for the service of Beer and Wine only

3. CE 27 LLC dba Quique Crudo 27 Bedford Street 10014 (OP–Restaurant)
(Change in Method of Operation: extend operating hours by 2 hours, add roadbed seating)
i. Whereas, the Son of the Applicant and the chef appeared before Community Board 2,
Manhattan’s SLA Committee #2 to present an application to the NYS Liquor Authority for a
Change in Method of Operation to the existing On-Premises Restaurant Liquor License (Lic
ID #0340-23-162143) to continue to operate a seafood and cocktail focused Mexican
restaurant within a non-conforming ground floor storefront in a residential four (4)-story
tenement style building (ca. 1900) on the residential only zoned block of Bedford Street
between Downing and West Houston Streets in Greenwich Village, the building’s ground
floor use predating the inception of residential only zoning in the 1930’s, the building falling
within NYC LPC’s designated Greenwich Village Historic District; and
ii. Whereas, the Applicant has been in operation with an On-Premises Liquor License at this
location since December/2023, the original application being heard by CB2 in
November/2022, the current request being to extend the hours of operation by 2 hours every
night for a 12 AM closing Mondays through Thursdays and 2 AM Fridays and Saturdays (the
questionnaire states a closing time of 4 PM Sunday), and to add roadbed seating; and
77iii. Whereas, prior to the Applicant opening their restaurant the storefront premises previously
operated as a dessert bar with a tavern-wine license and hours similar or earlier to the currently
licensed hours, the premises having never previously operated with an on-premises liquor
license; and
iv. Whereas, the Applicant appeared before CB2, Man. in October/2022 for the original
application and requested to lay the application over to November/2022 as there was
significant opposition from those living on Bedford Street and the Bedford Downing St. Block
Association to the original application which requested closing hours of 2 AM Mondays
through Saturdays, the opposition citing the residential nature and residential zoning on the
block, Bedford St. being a narrow, one way block with many buildings having ground floor
residents, the proposed hours being significantly later than other nearby restaurants, the
premises previously operating as a dessert bar and prior to that a café with earlier hours and
without an on-premises liquor license, the quality of life impacts being mitigated by the
method of operation and early hours of operation of the prior tenants; and
v. Whereas, the Applicant at the time of the original application having arrived at a compromise
with the community and block association, the community asking for closing hours of 10 PM
Sundays through Thursdays, 11 PM Fridays and Saturdays and no outside seating, the
Applicant asking to close at 12 AM Fridays and Saturdays in order to accommodate another
seating on those nights, the Applicant stating that midnight closing on Friday and Saturday
and 10 PM Sundays through Thursdays “was very reasonable”, a stipulation agreement was
signed and notarized for the sole purpose of establishing public interest with the Applicant’s
closing hours of operation being Sundays through Thursdays at 10 PM, Fridays and Saturdays
at 12 AM, no roadbed or sidewalk dining or any other outdoor uses for commercial purposes,
and recorded background music only; and
vi. Whereas, in addressing the need for the instant application, the Applicant stating they need
the additional hours to survive and with the size of the premises being only 400 sq. ft., there
being 12 seats at the bar for dining patrons and 4 seats at the window, the intention of adding
roadbed seating “was to get some of the people blocking the sidewalk traffic to have a place
to sit,” the restaurant operating without reservations, therefore patrons wait on the sidewalk
for seats to open up, the Applicant being unaware of the Dining Out NYC rules limiting hours
of operation to no later than midnight closing for outdoor seating and instead hoping to seat
patrons outside until 2 AM, in total disregard to the negative quality of life impacts that would
cause to the surrounding residents including neighboring ground floor residential tenants on
this very narrow residential street, so narrow that a specific waiver is required from the New
York City Fire Department because the roadbed dining does not conform to the published
Dining Out NYC regulations; and
vii. Whereas, there was significant opposition to the instant application from both the Carmine
Street Block Association and the West Village Residents Association as well as local
neighbors, the Applicant having already filed this Change in Method of Operation application
with the NYSLA without having done any outreach to either block association or outreach to
the community, additionally the Applicant also applied to FDNY for a waiver of the 15'
78emergency lane as part of the Dining Out NYC application, again without returning to the
community for discussion, the proposed changes to method of operation, within a year of
opening, is contrary to the specific compromises that were agreed to in order to gain support
of the original application from both the community and CB2, Man. which established public
interest for the issuance of this license, concerns were raised that the extension of hours will
simply extend the current noise and congestion on the sidewalk from patrons into the later
hours, the current earlier hours helping to mitigate the quality of life impacts, additional safety
concerns were raised regarding the request for an FDNY waiver of the 15' emergency lane;
and
viii. Whereas, the Applicant, being a successful, experienced restaurant operator as well as being
the long-term owner of the building, was presumably fully aware of the economics of running
a restaurant in a premises of that size when reaching an agreement and signing stipulations
with CB2, Man. in November/2022 that he stated “was very reasonable”, the agreement of
reasonable hours and no outdoor seating ever as well as regard for the Applicant as a long-
standing member of the community who compromised with the surrounding community being
the only reasons CB2, Man. recommended approval of the On-Premises restaurant liquor
license initially, the instant application seeking to reverse the very conditions that lead to
support of the initial application; and
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that Community Board 2, Manhattan recommends denial of
the application for the Change in Method of Operation for CE 27 LLC dba Quique Crudo 27
Bedford Street 10014; and
THEREFORE BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that should this application be considered by
the NYSLA, CB2, Manhattan respectfully requests that this item be calendared to appear before
the Full Board of the NYSLA.
Vote: Unanimous, 38 Board members in favor.
4. Puttery Manhattan LP dba Puttery 446 W 14th St 10014 (OP–Restaurant) (Change in
Method of Operation: extend closing hours 1st, 2nd, 3rd floors - 2AM, Cellar - 4AM; add
lounge with patron dancing, outside promoters, scheduled performances to Cellar)
i. Whereas, the Applicant’s Attorney and the Chief of Staff for Drive Shack, the management
and ownership group of the Puttery, appeared before CB2, Manhattan’s SLA Licensing
Committee #2 to present an application to the Liquor Authority for a Change in Method of
Operation to the existing On-Premises Restaurant Liquor License (Lic ID # 0340-23-132985,
exp. 8/31/2025) to continue to operate an indoor mini golf venue with immersive indoor mini
golf course rooms using a restaurant/bar concept with full service kitchen and craft cocktails
on three floors, cellar and rooftop of a three story commercial building (ca. 1936) on 14th
Street between Washington and 10th Avenue, the building falling within NYC LPC’s
designated Gansevoort Market Historic District; and
79ii. Whereas, the premises, which opened in Spring 2024 operates within the entire 24,000 sq. ft.
building and rooftop, with the basement/cellar containing a 13 tables with 60 seats, 1 stand
up bar with an additional 8 seats for 68 patron seats and 90 persons maximum, the first floor
will consist of a full service kitchen, entry and lobby space with no service to patrons, the
second floor will consist of a portion of a mini golf course with 10 additional tables with 42
patron seats, the third floor will again consist of a portion of mini golf course with 9 tables
and 38 patron seats and 1 stand up bar with 10 additional seats, the 4,738 sq. ft. rooftop
consisting of 1 stand up bar with 10 seats, 25 tables with 108 seats for a total rooftop seating
capacity of 118 patrons, the rooftop also having a proposed standing capacity/occupant load
of 175 person and a total occupancy for the entire premises of approximately 550 persons;
and
iii. Whereas, the Applicant presented the initial application to CB2, Manhattan in July/2022 at
which time CB2 unanimously recommended approval of the application with an executed
stipulation agreement which included interior hours of operation being Sundays 12 PM to 12
AM, Monday to Wednesday from 4 PM to 12 AM, Thursdays from 4 PM to 2AM, Fridays and
Saturdays from 11 AM to 2 AM, music for the interior will be background music, but there will
also be live music and DJs at entertainment music level, all doors and windows will be closed
at all times and there will be no dancing, no event where a cover fee is charged except for access
to play mini golf, no ropes or metal barricades on the sidewalk to contain patrons and a
reservation system will be in place at all times and entry will be only for those over the age of
21; the rooftop space will close by 11 PM Sundays to Thursdays and by 12 AM Fridays and
Saturdays, there will be no music played on the rooftop at any time, no TVs, no projectors and
no speakers installed on the rooftop; and
iv. Whereas, the Change in Method of Operation is as follows:
A. Overall hours sought:
Floors 1, 2 and 3: 11 AM to 2 AM daily
Cellar: 11 AM to 2 AM Sundays to Wednesdays,
11 AM to 4 AM Thursdays to Saturdays
Rooftop: 11 AM to 11 PM Sundays through Thursdays,
11 AM to 12 AM Fridays and Saturdays
Change in Hours
All floors: open daily at 11 AM
Floors 1, 2, 3: Sundays–Wednesdays extend closing hours from 12 AM to 2 AM
Cellar: Sundays–Wednesday extend closing hours from 12 AM to 2 AM
Thursdays–Saturdays extend closing hours from 2 AM to 4 AM
B. Entry to patrons of all ages from 11 AM to 4 PM daily
C. Changes to Cellar operations
• Will operate as a lounge/club from 10 PM to closing daily with a separate entrance
• There will be dancing, scheduled performances, outside promoters, cover fees,
bottle service and private parties (already existing are DJs and live music)
80• Access will be available to walk-ins (the current stated method of operation is
reservation only for the entire premises)
v. Whereas, when the Application was first heard in July/2022 it was presented as a multi-floor
mini golf and eating and drinking establishment operating as a single entity under one roof with
one entry, one name, one brand, patrons making reservations to enter the premises and once
inside could go to the various floors; the rooftop and cellar space described as places for persons
to visit before or after playing golf; there were extensive negotiations concerning the operation
of the roof to mitigate any quality of life impacts to area residents as well as visitors to The
High Line park, the Applicant entering into a stipulation agreement which included no speakers,
TVs, projectors, monitors, DJs or music on the rooftop premises at any time in addition to
reasonable closing hours for the rooftop at 11pm Sunday to Thursday and 12am Friday and
Saturday; and
vi. Whereas, as part of the instant application the Applicant is requesting to change the method of
operation of the cellar into a lounge/club after 10 PM with separate branding and name for the
cellar, a separate entrance, third party promotors, dancing and cover fees (the Applicant
removing the request for bottle service), the impacts of this change in method of operation being
significantly different than when the initial application was evaluated as one, reservation-only
business with earlier closing hours than those the Applicant is currently seeking, the lounge
space originally being presented as an accessory component of the mini golf experience with
the same hours of operation as the rest of the premises and serving the Puttery patrons as an
extra amenity as opposed to operating as a separate club venue with the additional impacts of
drawing a separate late-night crowd to the premises as the instant application is seeking; and
vii. Whereas, when asked how the Puttery is currently operating, the representative stated that the
patrons to the rooftop and cellar are people who are coming from mini golf and then will stay
and have drinks and food at the rooftop bar or listen to a DJ in the cellar and in the instant
application they are seeking to have more of a lounge-like experience for their patrons, and
when asked what stipulations they were violating in their current method of operation the
representative stated none; when asked about the large speakers on the rooftop that are on their
own website in derogation of the agreed upon stipulations, the representative acknowledged that
they were there but said they were never used, it was pointed out that during the initial
conversations with the Puttery that Puttery had wanted to keep the TVs on the rooftop without
sound until it was pointed out that if there’s the ability to have sound, there will be sound and
therefore the TVs were removed so it was surprising the Applicant installed large speakers on
the roof despite stipulations clearly stating no speakers on the roof and that agreement being
reached well before the rooftop was constructed; and
viii. Whereas, Puttery, in derogation of their current stipulations attached to their license, has been
branding both the rooftop and the cellar space as two separate and distinct entities on the doors
that flank the primary entrance to the Puttery with different names, the rooftop being branded
as Rory’s Rooftop and the cellar as Bomba Lounge; the rooftop having cross-promotional
events advertised on Eventbrite such as the one on August 24, 2024 titled “Tipsy Scoop Ice
Cream Social on Rory’s Rooftop” which advertised “the air will be alive with the sounds of live
81music…”, Bomba Lounge in the cellar has been operating in derogation of its stipulation
agreement since opening in late July/2024 by operating under reservation systems distinct and
separate from the Puttery, various DJs are advertised and patron dancing on an open dance floor
in addition to comedy shows, advertised hours for some events being until 3 AM, table
reservations for 8 people for $1500, bottle service with reservations made by email to various
hospitality groups, and found through bombalounge on TikTok, some of which link to posh.vip
for RSVPs, with none of these events being posted on the Puttery website nor including any
access to the larger Puttery premises, apparently operating separately from the other floors of
the licensed premises; the executed stipulation agreement stating the premises will not operate
as a lounge, there will be no bottle service and there will be no dancing, no event where a cover
fee is charged or scheduled performances, this calling into question the representations that were
made to CB2, Man. when the application was initially heard in July/2022; and
ix. Whereas, the Applicant’s flagrant disregard of their existing stipulations and failure to abide to
key stipulations previously made with the CB2, Man. to mitigate issues known to disrupt the
neighborhood and surrounding areas and which were submitted as part of the initial
recommendation of approval for their On-Premises Liquor License application to create public
interest, in conjunction with the fact that they have been violating numerous key stipulations
since opening, there was no faith that the Applicant could be trusted with regards to any future
stipulation agreement and that no consideration to any changes should be made by the SLA until
appropriate enforcement actions have been taken and adjudicated; and
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that Community Board 2, Manhattan recommends denial of
the application for the Change in Method of Operation for Puttery Manhattan LP dba Puttery
446 W 14th St 10014; and
THEREFORE BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that should this application be considered by
the NYSLA, CB2, Manhattan respectfully requests that this item be calendared to appear before
the Full Board of the NYSLA.

they disembark Pier 40 and when they return to Pier 40, the harmful quality of life impacts

STANDING COMMITTEE REPORTS WITH RESOLUTIONS
8FIRST LANDMARKS MEETING
1. *70 Perry St. –Application is to replace two wooden panels with glass in the entrance doors.
(Moved to the October 17 meeting.)
2. *594 Broadway –Application is to install a flagpole and banner.
Whereas:
A. The pole, banner, and placement mirror a neighboring installation which was approved by the
Landmarks Commission; and
B. The pole is 13’ , the banner is 10’ x 5’ and the banner has an clearance of 15’ above grade;
all of which are within the guidelines for similar situations in the district; and
C. The flag is equidistant from flags or banners on two neighboring, minimizing a cluttered
appearance in the streetscape; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends approval of the application for a pole and
banner that conform to regulations.
Vote: Unanimous, with 33 Board members in favor.
3. *138 Grand St. – Application is to install an ADA compliant ramp at the entrance.
Whereas:
A. The building requires an ADA ramp for entrance to the residential lobby and a shop adjoining
the lobby; and
B. The ramp will be at the minimum size and intrusion onto the sidewalk to conform to ADA
regulations; and
C. The applicant showed a similar ramp in a similar building in the neighborhood that was
approved by the Commission; and
D. A section of diamond plate will be added at the foot of the ramp to provide a flat surface to the
sidewalk; and
E. The supports are minimal with galvanized finish and the design is of a generally light
appearance; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends approval of the application for a well-
designed ADA ramp.
9Vote: Passed, with 32 Board members in favor, and 1 recusal (E. Yoo).
Note: Subsequent to the meeting, the applicant contacted the Committee saying that they
now wish to propose a new application that is substantially different from this
application. They will presumably present the new application at the November meeting.
4. *727 Greenwich St. - Application is to relocate window openings in the rear and side of the
building, add an exterior bay window and renew the stucco to accommodate the new floor
levels between the original front section of the building and an extension.
Whereas:
A. The building is one of several similar buildings in a cooperative which surround a common
interior courtyard, and the work is being undertaken by the holders of the building with the
permission and support of the board; and
B. Front facade work has been approved by the Commission staff and this application is
exclusively for work at the rear and south facades; and
C. The exterior work is necessitated by the aligning of the level of the rear floors of the extension
with the floor levels in the original (front) section of the building; and
D. The proposed replacement and added windows and door in the rear and south side facades are
in the style and color of similar facades in the courtyard; and
E. The design respects neighboring buildings in the courtyard; and
F. The substantial stair bulkhead will not be modified; and
G. A member of the co-op board read a letter of support on behalf of the board and submitted
other letters from 8 other members of the cooperative in support, and one letter in opposition was
sent after the meeting: now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends approval of this sensitive modification of
the building in the context of a cluster of buildings in a common interior courtyard.
Vote: Unanimous, with 33 Board members in favor.
5. *48 Barrow St. – Application is to reconstruct and reconfigure the rear facade with larger
windows, including a studio window on the top floor, excavate the rear yard to add a
foundation and to install steel structural support.
A. The building was constructed as one of a row of five similar houses, some of which have been
variously changed in the rear; and
10B. The extension has extensive structural problems, including lack of a proper foundation for the
existing extension, necessitating rebuilding and remediation; and
C. The windows throughout are degraded and, on the upper floors, are not of historic design; and
D. The rear wall of the extension and the upper floors are proposed to be rebuilt with large
openings to accommodate steel windows that lack any detailing, and which create a stark modern
appearance with no reference to, or respect for, the historic design of the building; and
E. The basement and parlor floor windows are united with the appearance of double height
windows, the second floor has a door and two windows of unequal width in the rebuilt rear wall
that would clearly have originally had the usual historic three punched equally spaced windows
of equal size; and
F. The roof has been raised at the back to accommodate an artist’s studio and a large studio
window is proposed to reflect this use; and
G. The removal of the low masonry wall from the top of the addition further enhances the stark
modern appearance and the meager railing is clearly non-historic; and
H. The application refers to ecologically unsound hardscaping modifications to the garden which
were not presented by the applicant; and
I. Most buildings in the large doughnut have original rear facades or sensitive modifications and
extensions and this stark and entirely modern design is an aggressive visual intrusion; and
J. Several members of the public spoke forcefully against the application: now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Manhattan recommends:
A. Denial of this ill-conceived modern intervention, which seems to favor a contemporary
window catalog at the expense of historic reference and sensitivity to a historic row house; and
B. That the applicant return with a design that respects both the historic character of the building
and the reasonably intact doughnut.
Vote: Unanimous, with 33 Board members in favor.
SECOND LANDMARKS MEETING
6. 70 Perry St. –Application is to replace two wooden panels with glass in the entrance doors.
Whereas:
A. The pair of entrance doors have four panels and the two upper panels are to have the wooden
panels removed and replaced with clear glass panels; and
11B. The moldings will be preserved giving the existing appearance apart from glass replacing the
solid wooden upper panels; and
C. The applicant showed photographs of similar doors in the street with glass as proposed; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends approval of the change of wooden panels
in the entrance doors to glass.
Vote: Unanimous, with 33 Board members in favor.
7. *327 Bleecker St. – Application is to construct a new building on the vacant lot.
Whereas:
A. The recently demolished building was at an important intersection of two major village streets,
was a unique part of the streetscape with three intact, buildings typical to the neighborhood and
bore the history of four alterations and additions; and
B. The building was in poor condition and an emergency demolition order was given by DOB in
2021 and the demolition was subsequently carried out; and
C. The application answers the objections from the Committee and the Commission to the prior
application in that it respects the original design of the building and the eastern extension and
storefronts at the ground floor; and
D. The original building was a three-story row house, typical to the district, and was subsequently
enlarged in four phases, acquiring a distinctive appearance as a result of the several interventions
throughout its history; and
E. The facades for the proposed building are in red brick with cast stone detailing and double
hung windows, a heavy cornice and a high parapet; and
F. There are typical storefront windows with 24” bulkheads in the main building on both facades
and one large bay with windows and door in the western extension; and
G. The rooftop mechanical equipment is only partially enclosed with acoustic material; and
H. The applicant showed several examples of similar treatments of similar buildings in the
immediate neighborhood; and
I. The ground floor detailing has sandstone and granite elements and sill panels salvaged from the
original building; and
J. The resulting building appears as a reproduction of a generic design of the period of the original
construction and carries no reference to the distinctive history of the unusual four alterations and
additions over its life; and
K. There was public testimony, with emphasis on the homogenized design; now
12Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends approval of the application provided:
A. The design is modified to recall the history of the interventions and modifications to the
building such as the mansard roof, the addition to the fourth story, the irregularity of the
Christopher Street facade and the separation of the extension from the original building; all of
which made it a distinctive part of the varied streetscapes of Greenwich Village; and.
B. That the rooftop mechanical equipment is completely surrounded by sound deadening acoustic
fencing.
Vote: Passed, with 32 Board members in favor, and 1 in opposition (B. Pape).
8. *79-81 Jane St. – Application is to construct rear and rooftop additions, and to excavate and
expand the cellar.
Whereas:
A. The houses, even with their twin-like appearance, historically presented and continue to
present as two distinct row houses and are the only intact pair in the row; and
B. The interior party wall is to be removed, having no effect to the facades, and the areaway
railings will be repositioned to provide for entrances in the fences away from the stoops, the
missing parlor floor window guards in 81will be matched to existing ones at 79, and the alterations
to the areaways include bluestone pavers and new gates; and
C. The areaways will be lowered and modified and paved with bluestone; and
D. The facade will be repointed with no intervention to the bricks except for repair and windows
in 81 will be matched to the historic design in 79; and
E. The owner and architect lately undertook similar approved alterations at an adjacent pair of
houses at numbers 81 and 83 including complete interior demolition and rebuilding and a similar
rebuilding of the rear facade and the rear facade essentially reproduces this layout with different
windows; and
E. The rear facade is to be rebuilt with full-width multipage steel windows on the basement and
parlor floors and double hung windows on the upper floors and a light well of modest size adjacent
to the basement and the addition does not unduly intrude upon the rather fully built doughnut; and
F. The cellar and garden excavations are similar to the adjacent houses and extend to the property
lines on the east and west and to five feet from the east and west property lines, and in the garden
to 5’ from the north property line; and
G. There is an elevator bulkhead and stair bulkhead that are shown from photographs of the
mockup not to be visible from any public thoroughfare; and
13H. The excavation, similar to that carried out in the neighboring houses, are that the basement
floor is to be lowered to 8’9” and the excavation extends under the rear yard to five feet from the
rear property line; and
I. The party wall between 79 and 77 will be underpinned in the same manner as was successfully
carried out between 79 and 81; and
J. The garden is covered in blue pavers with a light well and skylights; and
K. The central party wall is to be removed with the building having been stabilized with temporary
supports similar to the work in 81 and 83 and the applicant gave convincing testimony that the
interior demolition, excavation, underpinning and other engineering work are being carefully
considered and that the work will be carefully planned and carried out with monitoring and
observing all applicable regulations; and
L. Members of the public testified, primarily to the point that the front facade should not look as
though the buildings, though a mirror image pair, should not look as though they had been
combined; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:
A. The front façade proposal be amended to include subtle differences in order to ensure that the
houses retain their unambiguous current and historic appearance as two separate and individual
row houses; and
B. That the rear facade and non-visible rooftop additions be approved; and
C. That the excavation, underpinning, monitoring, and any other engineering work be approved
provided that it carefully follow all applicable rules and regulations to ensure the integrity of the
property and the adjoining properties.
Vote: Unanimous, with 33 Board members in favor.
9. *271 W. 11th St. – Application is to renovate rear façade to include new steel doors at basement
and ground floor and replace double hung wood windows at 3rd and 4th floors in existing window
openings; install new painted wood panels at 2nd floor and bluestone wall finish at ground and
basement floor, repair or replace brick walls at upper floors to match existing.

OUTDOOR DINING
Resolution #1
Application to DOT for a Sidewalk Cafe:
14St. Tropez Wine Bar LLC dba St. Tropez Wine Bar, 302 West 4th Street, 10014
(Dining Out NYC – Sidewalk Cafe)
Whereas, the comments related to the sidewalk cafe setup’s physical footprint and dimensions:
• The establishment is located on West 4th Street between Bank Street and West 12th Street in
the West Village;
• The sidewalk on West 4th Street at this location is 10’ (10 feet) wide;
• The updated site plan dated October 22, 2024 indicates there is one area on the sidewalk
where one (1) table and two (2) chairs is proposed for the sidewalk cafe measuring 7’ (7 feet)
length by 2’ (2 feet) width;
• The Applicant/Licensee, Yohann Pecheux, appeared via Zoom at the CB2 Outdoor Dining
Working Group meeting on October 15, 2024;
Whereas, the comments related to pedestrian flow are as follows:
• The establishment is located on a neighborhood corridor street, which requires an 8-foot clear
path on the sidewalk;
• There is a cellar door on the sidewalk, located south of the proposed sidewalk cafe perimeter,
is frequently open throughout the day and during service, and there are no tables or chairs
adjacent to or on top of the cellar door;
• Several members of the public testified regarding inaccurate measurements on the
Applicant/Licensee’s original site plan, which has since been mitigated and reflected in the
updated site plan dated October 22, 2024;
;
Whereas, the comments related to potential conflicts with existing curb use (i.e. planters, bike
racks, bus stops) are as follows:
• There are two tree beds, one located north of the proposed sidewalk cafe setup and the
other located south of the sidewalk cafe setup which are not in conflict with the proposed
sidewalk cafe setup;
Additional Notes:
• It should be noted that the Applicant/Licensee received a Department of Buildings violation
and summons for Work without a Permit on February 26, 2021 for installing electrical wiring
15for the Applicant/Licensee’s outdoor dining structure during the temporary Open Restaurants
program;
• It should be noted that several members of the public testified against this roadway cafe
application because the Applicant/Licensee was not, in their opinion, cooperative in
maintaining an outdoor dining setup that was in compliance with the rules during the
temporary program and currently through this transition from the temporary program to the
permanent program;
Whereas, the recommended modifications for the sidewalk cafe setup are:
The Applicant/Licensee acknowledged and agreed to modifications relating to the above-
referenced sidewalk cafe application when they appeared in person at the October 15, 2024 CB2
Outdoor Dining Working Group meeting.
• Acknowledges that the sidewalk width of West 4th Street at the location of the establishment
measures 10’ (10 feet), which is indicated on the updated site plan dated October 22, 2024;
• Acknowledges that the required 8-foot clear path cannot be met with the proposed table that
is closest to the tree bed north of the northern door of the establishment and therefore agree
to remove this table from the proposed site plan, which is now indicated on the updated site
plan dated October 22, 2024;
• Confirm that the Applicant/Licensee has a signed Cellar Door Certification on file with DOT
in the Dining Out NYC application portal that is signed and sealed by a licensed design
professional, which ensures that “(iii) the placement of tables and chairs [on top of the cellar
door] is safe for the use of sidewalk cafe patrons and the general public;”
• Will have only one (1) table and two (2) chairs on the sidewalk between the two doors of the
establishment in order to maintain the required 8-foot clear path on West 4th Street, which is
a Neighborhood Corridor street in DOT’s Pedestrian Mobility Plan;
• Support of the Applicant/Licensee’s position which was initiated by the Applicant/Licensee
and offered verbally at the CB2 hearing: the Applicant/Licensee intends to withdraw the
sidewalk cafe for this if the Applicant/Licensee is approved by NYC DOT for a roadway cafe
in the Dining Out NYC program at this location. This was also codified in writing and signed
by the Applicant/Licensee;
• Submitted an updated site plan dated October 22, 2024 to CB2 and NYC DOT reflecting the
modifications outlined in this section;
16Whereas, the Working Group voted to conditionally deny the application as-is in order to work
with the Applicant/Licensee, who did appear at the CB2 public hearing on October 15, 2024 via
Zoom, towards agreement on the proposed modifications voted on by the Working Group;
Whereas, the Applicant/Licensee agreed to the proposed modifications for the sidewalk cafe, and
the denial is now an approval with modifications;
Whereas, the Applicant/Licensee agreed to return to CB2 prior to submitting any changes to any
modifications agreed to herein;
Therefore Be It Resolved, Manhattan CB2 recommends approval with modifications of the
Dining Out NYC sidewalk cafe for St. Tropez Wine Bar LLC dba St. Tropez Wine Bar, 302 West
4th Street, 10014.
Vote: Unanimous, 33 Board Members in favor.

Report
Agenda Item #6:
FY26 District Needs Statement and Capital & Expense Budget Priorities
The number one problem in reviewing applications for Dining Out NYC is inaccurate and
incomplete site plans, particularly the plans that are not created by a licensed architect. In the cases
where plans are not created by a design professional, the applicant usually ends up having to adjust
the plan due to an incorrect measurement or missing obstruction.
The Working Group proposes that the NYC Department of Business Services create a grant
program for restaurant operators to use for procuring architectural services related to Dining Out
NYC.
Expense Budget Item for FY26 Priorities:
Request: Establish funding for a grant program that provides restaurant operators with financial
support to cover architectural services for developing site plans as part of their Dining Out NYC
applications
Agency: Department of Small Business Services
Agenda Item #7:
New Business
A few hours before the meeting start time on Tuesday, October 15, 2024, NYC DOT referred one
sidewalk cafe application (Upright Holdings 547 LLC dba Leitao, 547 Hudson Street, 10014) to
CB2, which was unusual because the agency typically refers applications on Mondays only.
However, the week of the meeting, there was a holiday on Monday, October 14.
In addition, DOT referred this application to CB2 with an incorrect deadline stated on the
application – giving the board only nine (9) days to review the application, which is incorrect as
the legislation and rules allow forty (40) days for community board review of sidewalk cafe
applications. This is not the first time this has happened. In addition, the agency has also
erroneously sent applications intended for MCB2 to Brooklyn CB2. As of the date of this meeting,
community boards across the city have not been granted access to the Dining Out NYC program,
which was promised by DOT back in March and rely solely on receiving application referrals via
email.
26The committee briefly acknowledged the receipt of Leitao sidewalk cafe application referral. The
public hearing for this application will be held in November.
SCHOOLS AND EDUCATION
Resolution Urging Governor Hochul to Sign Senate Bill S. 5481 /A. 2898 into Law to Provide
Critical Support for Individuals with Dyslexia and Their Families
1. Whereas, dyslexia is a specific learning disability that impacts as many as one in five children,
impeding their ability to achieve academic and personal success without timely diagnosis and
intervention¹; and
2. Whereas, comprehensive neuropsychological exams are recognized as the most effective tool for
diagnosing dyslexia, yet are prohibitively expensive and often not covered by insurance, leaving
many families unable to afford these essential services²; and
3. Whereas, the information gap between evaluations provided by the city compared to those done
privately — which typically cost over $5,000 — is part of a broader systemic issue of inequitable
access to special education services³; and
4. Whereas, interviews with more than two dozen advocates, parents, and experts revealed a flawed
two-tiered evaluation system that leaves many students' needs unaddressed, creating disparities in
the quality of services provided³⁴; and
5. Whereas, like many aspects of the city's public school system, the evaluation process for special
education is complicated for parents to navigate, with families who can afford private evaluations
gaining a significant advantage⁴; and
6. Whereas, school psychologists, who are responsible for conducting special education evaluations,
work under heavy caseloads, which can make it challenging to conduct thorough evaluations, often
delaying assessments and leaving students without vital services for months⁵⁶; and
7. Whereas, untreated dyslexia is linked to long-term consequences such as anxiety, depression,
lower education levels, increased poverty, and higher incarceration rates, all of which strain New
York's social and economic systems⁷; and
8. Whereas, Senate Bill S. 5481/A. 2898 passed the New York State Senate on June 7, 2024,
demonstrating strong legislative support for ensuring equitable access to dyslexia diagnosis and
intervention;
Therefore, be it resolved that Community Board 2 (CB2) supports Senate Bill S. 548/A. 28981 ,
which mandates that health insurance policies provide coverage for neuropsychological exams
necessary to diagnose dyslexia, ensuring equitable access to early diagnosis and intervention for
all New Yorkers, regardless of their financial status; and
Be it further resolved that CB2 calls upon Governor Hochul to sign Senate Bill A. 2898/S. 5481
into law to provide critical support for individuals with dyslexia and their families.

(Change in Method of Operation)
i. Whereas, the Applicant and the Applicant’s attorney appeared before Community Board 2,
Manhattan’s SLA Licensing Committee #1 to present an application to the NYS Liquor

in the ground floor and cellar of an M1-5/R7X-zoned, one (1)-story commercial building (ca.
2002) on West Broadway between Prince and West Houston Streets (Block #516/Lot #37)
the building falling within NYC LPC’s designated SoHo-Cast Iron Historic District
Extension; and
ii. Whereas, the Applicant has been in operation with an on-premises liquor license at this
location since February/2023, the original application being heard by CB2, Manhattan in
February/2022, the premises being previously unlicensed, the Change in Method of Operation
is to extend the hours of operation by one hour Mondays through Saturdays, the Applicant
explaining the purpose of said extension of hours is for patrons who are already in the
restaurant to be able to extend their time to have another drink and not for the purposes of
permitting patrons to enter later, the Applicant stating that the advertised hours of operation
would not be changing and there would be no other change to their method of operation; and

iv. Whereas, concerns were raised by CB2, Man. that the granting of the later hours of operation
with those hours being later than most “restaurant” hours in the area would change the method
of operation from that of a restaurant to that of a late night bar, those concerns being addressed
when the Applicant gave assurance that the advertised hours would remain within the current
method of operation, though unable to state what the current advertised hours were, and that
the intent was simply to allow dinner guests to linger longer and not to extend the hours for
new arrivals; the current posted closing hours being Mondays and Tuesdays at 9 PM,
Wednesdays to Saturdays at 10 PM; following the committee meeting the Applicant unwilling
to agree to sign stipulations specifically stating those advertised closing hours but willing to
agree to advertising hours not later than 11:30 PM and 12:30 PM with the understanding that
the reason Community Board 2, Man. is recommending approval of the application with
signed stipulations is to permit guests that arrive under their current method of operation to
stay a bit longer for an after-dinner drink and not to permit patrons to arrive later then one
would for a full dinner service under the existing hours of operation (12 AM and 1 AM
Fridays and Saturdays); and
v. Whereas, the Applicant has executed and has had notarized a Stipulations Agreement with

in another tier (retail), the representative stating that there was legislation (Senate Bill

verbally providing information to CB2, Man. that was contrary to that on the questionnaire,
the proposed hours of operation presented by the Applicant and his representative are 8 AM
to 11 PM Saturdays through Sundays (7 days a week) which was in contrast to the 7 AM to

questionnaire stating juke box and failing to address the other elements listed above; and
v. Whereas, members of the community and the South Village Neighbors spoke in opposition
to the application, there had been no outreach to residents of the building or neighbors, there

including the prior occupant of the premises (3 of Cups LLC, Lic. ID #0240-22-100659)
which had a 12 AM closing time imposed on them by the NYSLA, the residents being relieved
to hear that the actual closing time was 11 PM though some thought it should be earlier than
that; and
vi. Whereas, there is roadbed seating from the prior occupant, the Applicant of the instant
application being unaware that the outdoor seating does not transfer from one operator to the
next and has been using the roadbed seating, at first saying they were not serving alcohol
outside but then admitting to the service of alcohol in the roadbed when confronted with
photographs taken just prior to the CB2, Man. meeting, the prior Applicant having a restriction
on the liquor license imposed by the NYSLA at their February 16, 2022 full board hearing
that there would be no service of alcohol outside until such time as they returned to CB2,
Man. which they never did, the Applicant’s manager being unaware of the rules and stating

that they will apply for any exterior seating that they can have at a future time; residents on
38this narrow, residential block remain opposed to any exterior seating at the location, this being
a residential block where outdoor seating was never permitted before the pandemic and the
eating and drinking establishments are previously non-conforming uses; residents being
concerned about the lack of clarity regarding the method of operation as presented, the
Applicant being strictly an investor, the manager appearing unfamiliar with rules and
regulations and not having had much experience in running a restaurant, the manager
explaining that her daughter, who also appeared, has experience in the hospitality business
and is going to be moving back from London to help; and

Board 2 and in the immediate area, there being 92 active licensed premises within 750 feet
of the proposed premises according to LAMP to be licensed and an additional 13 pending
licenses within this same area, this application being for the service of beer and wine only and
thus not subject to the 500 Foot Rule, the applicant stating the hours are 8 AM to 11 PM with
the premises having previously been licensed for the service of beer and wine with similar
hours; and
viii. Whereas, the committee voted to recommend denial of the application unless the hours as
presented and agreed to at the meeting were part of the stipulations along with other
stipulations the Applicant and manager agreed to during the CB2 meeting; the Applicant
letting CB2 know a number of days later that they did not mean what was said at the meeting
regarding closing hours and instead want the hours of operation as written in the
questionnaire, those hours being closing at 1 AM daily; in an effort to come to a compromise
with the Applicant, the stipulations were amended with a closing hour of 12 AM daily, the
same hours as the NYSLA had imposed on the prior occupant, the Applicant unwilling to
agree to those hours; and

i. Whereas, the Applicant, the Applicant’s representative and the manager appeared before
Community Board 2, Manhattan’s SLA Committee #1 to present an application to the NYS
Liquor Authority for a tavern wine license to operate a small coffee shop and wine bar in a
ground floor storefront within a five (5)-story tenement-style residential building (ca.1901)
on Thompson Street between Prince and Spring Streets (Block #503/Lot #26), this building
falling within NYC LPC’s designated Sullivan-Thompson Historic District; this is one of two
applications this Applicant and related parties presented to CB2, Man. this month, the other
being Let’s Talk SoHo at 150 Sullivan Street; and
ii. Whereas, the storefront premises is approximately 650 sq. ft. (350 sq. ft on the ground floor
and 300 sq. ft. in the cellar, the cellar is accessed via a sidewalk hatch with no patron
occupancy to the cellar), there will be three (3) tables with nine (9) seats and one counter with
seven (7) seats for a total seated patron occupancy of 16 persons, there is one entrance serving
as patron ingress and egress and one (1) bathroom, the store front infill being fixed without
operable doors or windows that open out to the sidewalk; and
iii. Whereas, the hours of operation as presented at the CB2, Man. meeting will be Sundays
through Saturdays (7 days a week) from 8 AM to 1 AM as presented in the questionnaire, the
Applicant stating the actual hours are 8 AM to 11 PM and that the later hour is for staff to
clean up; music is background music, the questionnaire indicating TVs but the Applicant was
unclear as to any specifics, most of the information on the questionnaire was not filled out,
the menu provided was the menu for the other application applied for by the Applicant at this
same meeting, Let’s Talk SoHo; and
iv. Whereas, the premises to be licensed has previously never been licensed for the service of
alcohol, since 2021 the premises has been occupied by Drip Drop Coffee who will be moving
to another location on Thompson Street at the end of October/2024 and for many years prior
to that as Porto Rico Importing Coffee and Tea; and
40v. Whereas, Drip Drop coffee had installed benches around the tree pit and roadbed seating
extending significantly past their storefront premises, the Applicant intending to file for as
much seating as permitted in both the roadbed and sidewalk but no specifics were provided
with the application, the Applicant seeming unaware of any of the rules of the permanent
Dining Out NYC program, those rules not permitting roadbed seating to extend past the
storefront premises with clear path restrictions on the narrow sidewalk and a fire hydrant
adjacent to the premises making the availability of outdoor seating limited if allowed at all,
especially as it compares to what the current occupant is utilizing and had most likely been
using to sustain their business during the pandemic – the current premises having more seating
outside than inside due to not having to abide by the permanent rules nor pay for the use of
the roadbed, concerns being raised that the Applicant did not properly evaluate the limited
amount of seating that will be available under the new rules, concerns being raised that there
was no clear plan or method of operation presented with the application, that much of the
information was missing from the questionnaire, that the hours verbally presented were
different from those on the instant application, the Applicant having no prior business
experience in the hospitality industry stating they are investing significant money and will
figure it out and fix things as they learn, the manager, while stating she has some recent
experience in conjunction with the Bryant Park Winter Village, has never run a restaurant
before and is now proposing to manage two restaurants within a few blocks of each other on
residential blocks; and
vi. Whereas, neighbors and the South Village Neighbors block association spoke against the
application, there being the usual concerns of licensing another previously unlicensed small
retail shop, this being of particular due to both because this is a residential block and the lack
of any clear business plan being presented by this Applicant, that coffee shops have much
earlier closing hours, the hours requested being late for even a full-service restaurant on that
block, the Applicant stating they need to be able to serve wine until 11 PM because the rent
is so high; and
vii. Whereas, there already are a significant number of licensed establishments in both Community
Board 2 and in the immediate area, there being 67 active licensed premises within 750 feet
of the proposed premises according to LAMP to be licensed and an additional 5 pending
licenses within this same area, this application being for the service of beer and wine only and
thus not subject to the 500 Foot Rule, the applicant stating the hours are 8 AM to 11 PM; and
viii. Whereas, the committee voted to recommend denial of the application unless the hours as
presented and agreed to at the meeting were part of the stipulations in addition to there being
no service or consumption of alcohol to patrons sitting on the tree bench along with other
stipulations the Applicant and manager agreed to during the CB2 meeting such as background
music only, no TVs, that the façade remain fixed and that they return to CB2, Man. for an
alteration to their license if they decide to apply for outdoor seating as required by the
NYSLA; the Applicant letting CB2 know a number of days later that they did not mean what
was said at the meeting regarding hours and instead want the hours of operation as written in
the questionnaire, those hours being closing at 1 AM daily; and
41THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that CB2, Manhattan recommends denial of the application
for a tavern wine license for Cafe and Spirits 107 Thompson St 10012; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that should this application be considered by the SLA, CB2,
Manhattan respectfully requests that this item be calendared to appear before the Full Board of the
SLA.

building and celebrities, they stated that they are often still busy when closing at 2 AM so

residents; the Applicant’s representative also explaining that the addition of DJs is not really
a change but to correctly reflect the method of operation they were currently operating under,

of the committee remained uncomfortable with the 4 AM closing, so a closing time of 3 AM
Thursdays through Saturdays was proposed to the Applicant following the meeting which

interest standard, this application showing modified hours, no DJs, no live music and no
outdoor seating – something the Applicant had previously stated was essential to his business
model; and
vi. Whereas, the Applicant is the principal of a coffee bar which opened on Madison Avenue in
September/2023 (BVJH International Corporation dba Cinico, Lic ID #0267-24-100297, exp
12/31/25), that coffee bar offering breakfast, lunch and dinner with posted closing hours of
9 PM daily, that premises being much larger and having a full kitchen where bread and meals
are made, the Applicant stating as he did last month that most of the meals would be prepared
at his other premises and brought down to the Jane Street premises, questions being raised
again about the viability of this method of operation if it relies on food being prepared at the
sister location which has been open for only approximately one year; and
vii. Whereas, a member of the Jane Street Block Association, who was also contacted by a
resident living above the premises and who was in touch with other nearby residents, came to
speak about concerns remaining that there had been no outreach again to residents living in
the building, that those residents said they could hear people’s footsteps walking down the
street at night because it was so quiet and the impacts this establishment might have on their
quality of life, that there was no plan presented for soundproofing as there had not been when
the Applicant appeared for the on-premises license the residents being able to clearly hear the
past retail activities within this premises which operated during normal daytime business
hours, and that the Applicant had not engaged with the Jane Street Block Association
regarding this new application and the proposed changes made to the method of operation to
help alleviate the residents’ concerns since presenting their on-premises application to CB2,
the Jane Street Block Association being their only direct neighborhood contact; and
viii. Whereas, the method of operation still not being clearly defined as the instant application
builds off of their uptown location, yet their uptown location’s method of operation is more
of a daytime to early evening premises serving breakfast, lunch and dinner – the earlier hours
being something this neighborhood is lacking yet the instant application has removed the
earlier hours and its business model is to open for dinner hours only in an area that has an
abundance of dinner options including many specializing in Italian food; and
ix. Whereas, there already are a significant number of licensed establishments in both
Community Board 2 and in the immediate area, there being 62 active licensed premises within
750 feet of the proposed premises to be licensed according to LAMP and an additional 8
pending licenses within this same area, this application being for the service of beer and wine
only and thus not subject to the 500 Foot Rule, the Applicant adjusting their hours and other
aspects of the application to be more in alignment with the residents’ concerns, though there
remains a lack of understanding by CB2 as to how so many elements of the original
application which we were told were essential to the business model can be removed (full
54liquor, late hours, live music, outdoor seating, events) and the business model remain viable
without any expansion of hours or services into the earlier part of the day, the Applicant
stating they are confident the proposed method of operation will work for them; and
x. Whereas, the Applicant has executed and has had notarized a Stipulations Agreement with
Community Board 2, Manhattan that they agreed to submit to the NYSLA and agreed would
be incorporated into the “method of operation” of their tavern wine license and the stipulations
are as follows:
1. Premises will be advertised and operated as an Italian café with less than a full kitchen
but will serve food during all hours of operation.
2. The hours of operation will be 4 PM to 10 PM Sundays through Thursdays and 4 PM to
12 AM Fridays and Saturdays. No patrons will remain after stated closing time.
3. The premise will not operate as a Sports Bar, Lounge or Tavern or allow any portion of
premises to be operated in that manner.
4. Will not operate a backyard garden or any other outdoor area for commercial purposes
including any sidewalk café and/or roadbed seating now or in the future.

8. Will close all doors and windows at all times, allowing only for patron ingress and egress.
9. Will not have private events or pop-up events.

drinking for store front premises proposed to be licensed prior to opening.
14. Will not have unlimited drink or unlimited food and drink specials. Will not have “boozy
brunches.” No pitchers of beer.
15. Will not have any of the following: dancing, DJs, live music, promoted events, any event

doormen/security personnel.
16. Will not add more principals as presented to CB2 with greater than 20% share of business
prior to submission of original application to the NYSLA.
17. Will appear before CB2, Man. prior to submitting any changes to any stipulation agreed
to herein.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that CB2, Man. recommends denial of the tavern wine
application for One Jane LLC dba Cinico 1 Jane St 10014 unless the statements of the applicant
as presented to CB2 are accurate and complete, and that those conditions and stipulations agreed
55to by the applicant relating to the above-stated stipulations are incorporated into the “Method of
Operation” of the NYSLA liquor license.
Vote: Unanimous, 32 Board Members in favor.
4. Christopher Street Hospitality LLC 115 Christopher St 10014 (OP–Restaurant)
(Transfer)
i. Whereas, the Applicant and the Applicant’s Attorney appeared before Community Board 2,
Manhattan’s SLA Licensing Committee #2 for a new on-premises restaurant liquor license to

use building (circa 1903) on a residential-zoned block on Christopher Street between Bleecker

designated Greenwich Village Historic District; and
ii. Whereas, the ground floor storefront sought to be licensed is a transfer application from The
Village Academy Bar Inc dba The Hangar (Lic. ID # 0340-23-130034, SN # 1025682) which
operated as an unassuming gay bar from June 1993 to January 2024, prior to that the premises
had been licensed as Christopher’s since the 1980’s, and as the Green Hornet in the 1960’s;
and
iii. Whereas, the interior storefront is approximately 3,100 sq. ft. with 1,900 sq. ft. on the ground
floor and 1,200 sq. ft. basement, the basement being accessed by entering a vestibule shared
by the residential occupants of the building which connects to the interior staircase leading to
the Applicant’s basement space, there will be no patron use of the basement, the basement
being used for storage purposes only; there will be seven (7) tables and 24 seats and two (2)

v. Whereas, the Applicant first appeared before CB2, Man. in May/2024 at which time residents
of the building, neighbors and the local block association raised many concerns about the
application including the 4 AM closing time and the possibility of outdoor seating, this being
a residential block with many pre-existing, non-conforming ground floor retail spaces, the
56involvement of Eytan Sugarman who is the owner of White Horse Hospitality LLC at 569
Hudson Street where there has been an extensive disciplinary history and who was most
recently before the NYSLA regarding an endorsement application for HHLP Union Square
Associates LLC, etc dba Hyatt Union Square; Bowery Road; Library of Distilled Spirits at 76
East 13th Street (Lic. ID #0343-23-103211), and the lack of outreach to the residents of the
area, the Applicant asking to lay the application over to do further outreach with the
community; and
vi. Whereas, the Applicant returned to CB2, Man. after doing outreach to residents of the
building, including conducting a conference call at which a number of residents participated,
and getting into the premises to address some of the concerns raised at the previous meeting
– outdoor seating has been removed from the application, music will be background only with
no DJs as there were complaints that the prior operator would occasionally have DJs and live
music, the front windows will not be made operable and will remain closed at all times and
doors will remain closed at all times, they will have security to keep the frontage of the
premises and immediate surrounding area clear, to bring people inside and to prevent cars
from idling outside, there will be regularly scheduled pest maintenance, the Applicant stated
they are not willing to apply for closing hours earlier than 4 AM and while they may close
earlier, they would like the ability to be open until 4 AM as the prior occupants of the premises
were permitted to do because they stated that this premises was not subject to the 500 ft rule
because the location had been continuously licensed since prior to 1993; and
vii. Whereas, residents of the building continued to voice their concerns over the application,
those concerns being the late hours in a residential block and neighborhood, there are both
young children and older adults living in the building and those hours, especially during the
week, will cause quality of life issues for them; there were many concerns about work being
done in the basement and ground floor with no permits posted, that there are new hot water
heaters, the Applicant’s attorney stating he checked with the Applicant and those involved
with any work the Applicant may be doing and that building permits were not necessary for
work they are doing at the time and that the hot water heaters were not installed by the
Applicant; additional concerns were raised about patrons previously being able to access the
shared vestibule area outside of the licensed premises that leads to the cellar, the Applicant
stating they will strictly monitor the door to the vestibule, agreeing in executed stipulations to
post signage on that door stating “Employees Only”; neighbors also continued to raise
concerns about the involvement of Eytan Sugarman because of his negative history with his
other establishments in the immediate area, the Applicant and his attorney not able to clarify
at this time what percentage of ownership he will hold in the LLC as that was still be worked
out, as the Applicant was not able to answer there were significant concerns as to who would
be actually making the final decisions about the business and its method of operation; there
remained concerns about the front window being operable despite assurances by the attorney
that if the existing window is currently operable it will remain closed, the neighbor pointing
out that this attorney had made those same assurances a number of years ago elsewhere and
that window was made operable and has caused considerable quality of life concerns for those
57residents; another newer resident of the building said that he had had discussions with the
Applicant and his attorney and found them to be responsive and was not opposed to the
application; and
viii. Whereas, while members of CB2’s SLA Licensing Committee, residents of the building and
the public would like earlier closing hours consistent with hours that a non-conforming
business should operate on a residentially only zoned street and in a residential building, the
Applicant stating that this application is not subject to the 500 Foot Rule as it has been
continuously licensed prior to 1993, therefore the public interest standard does not apply to
this application, there already are a significant number of licensed establishments in both
Community Board 2 and in the immediate area, there being 86 active licensed premises
within 750 feet of the proposed premises according to LAMP to be licensed and an additional
9 pending licenses within this same area, the Applicant has executed and has had notarized a

September/2016, CB2, Man. unanimously recommending approval of the application with
extensive stipulations that took into account the adjacent property owners, the premises at that
time having a large glass wall in the rear which directly faces residential buildings, those

6. RemyMidtown LLC 35 E 13th St aka 119-121 University Pl 10003 (OP–Bar/Tavern)
i. Whereas, the Applicant and the Applicant’s Attorney appeared before Community Board 2,
Manhattan’s SLA Committee #2 to present an application to the NYS Liquor Authority for
an On-Premises Tavern Liquor License to operate a bar and lounge on the 2nd, 3rd and rooftop
floors of a three (3)-story commercial building (ca. 1950) on the northeast corner of University
Place and East 13th Street (Block #565/Lot #5; and
ii. Whereas, the premises is approximately 5,400 sq. ft, with each floor being approximately
1,800 sq. ft., the floors connected by an interior stairway; the information provided did not
specify how many tables and chairs but stated the occupancy on the 2nd and 3rd floors to be
150 persons each and the rooftop 74 persons for a total occupancy of 374 persons, there are
three (3) stand up bars, one on each floor including the rooftop, there are ten (10) seats at the
bar on the 2nd floor and no seats at the other bars, there are four (4) bathrooms, there is one
entry on University Place and another on East 13th Street which may both be used for patron
ingress and egress; there are operable windows throughout the 2nd and 3rd floors of the
premises, there are no enclosures on the rooftop; and
iii. Whereas, the hours of operation are from 11 AM to 2 AM Sundays and Mondays and 11 AM
to 4 AM Tuesdays through Saturdays on the interior and 11 AM to 12 AM Sundays through
Thursdays on and 11 AM to 2 AM Fridays and Saturdays on the rooftop; music will be
amplified at entertainment levels with DJs and live music, there will be up to 36 private parties
per year, there will be 20 TVs on the 2nd floor, four (4) TVs on the 3rd floor and two (2) TVs
on the rooftop, all doors and windows will be closed at all times except for patron ingress and
egress, there will be two to six security personnel as needed, mostly on Fridays through
Sundays; and
iv. Whereas, the diagrams provided were roughly drawn with no orientation of the streets, both
the Applicant and the representative having difficulty being able to orient the drawings, there
was no indication of the patron entry from either street leading from the ground floor to the
2nd floor or throughout the premises, the building having only temporary Certificate of
Occupancies active sporadically over the years, the last one expiring November 6, 2019, there
are separate Place of Assembly permits for each floor as opposed to one for the overall
premises, the Applicant trying to say that the premises had been licensed prior to 1993, but
there remain questions as to when each floor was licensed and the cumulative impacts of the
successively added 2nd, 3rd and roof top floors, the ground floor never been a part of this
premises, the prior occupant appearing before CB2, Man. in March/2010 to add the rooftop
to the license, there are safety concerns because the premises has never received a final
62Certificate of Occupancy with multiple temporary certificates of occupancy which have only
been sporadically sought over the years in effect for short 90 day periods throughout the
previous licensee’s history of operation, remining without an active permit for much more
time than ever having an active temporary permit, it remaining an open question as to whether
each of the separate place of assembly permits for the large occupancies on the 2nd and 3rd
floor are active if there is no certificate of occupancy, believed to be a required element to
seek a permanent place of assembly and keep it active; and,
v. Whereas, significant concerns were raised about the operation of the rooftop, the late hours,
the Applicant intending to have speakers and TVs on the unenclosed rooftop, there may be
heaters used to extend the season, the Applicant intending to use the standup bar installed by
the prior occupant, that bar was initially presented to CB2, Man. as a service bar, the
stipulations of the prior occupant stating there would be no music on the rooftop which they
disregarded, the premises having a large amount of 311 noise complaints over the past with
a significant number occurring in the past few years, when the rooftop was initially built out
to expand the licensed premises, large metal sheets or some other material were placed on the
west and south sides (the open sides) in an effort to isolate any sound from escaping, at the
time there were not as many residential buildings around the building that were taller so
sound going up and out from the rooftop did not impact surrounding residents as much, the
stipulations agreed to minimize this impact, prior to the installation of the rooftop it was more
the sound escaping from the poorly insulated interior and the glass windows, but in the past
few years there have been multiple new taller residential buildings built in the immediate area
that the rooftop activities and lack of adherence to the stipulations created a significant
impact, there has also been an increase in 311 noise complaints at the establishment since
those buildings have been built; and
vi. Whereas, the Applicant, who intends to manage the premises, has never held a liquor license
before, his experience is from owning an unlicensed pizza restaurant in New Jersey for many
years, concerns being raised regarding his lack of experience in running a fully-licensed
premises in New York, that concern being exacerbated by the other aspects of the application
– that this is an application for a club/lounge with DJs, dancing and live music, the 2 AM and
4 AM hours closing hours with it being often noted that nothing good happens between 2 AM
and 4 AM, the open air rooftop and bar with a history of operating improperly and that the
area is surrounded by colleges with those students likely to be the ones frequenting the
establishment, the Applicant not showing any plans as to how the premises will be managed;
and
vii. Whereas, several members of the East 12th, 13th St Block Association and University Pl
Residents Association that live close to the premises had spoken with the Applicant and had
concerns regarding the application, the premises being the most problematic for the neighbors
going back over ten years on University Place, the members under the impression that the 500
Foot Rule may not apply here after being told that by the applicant with no evidence, thereby
eliminating the public interest standard for the license and conversations to mitigate the
impacts not occurring, CB2, Man. believing otherwise, the residents therefore trying to ensure
63that the Applicant will properly insulate the premises and do sound tests with the local
residents but had serious concerns about the application including the continuation of noise
issues from music and crowds on the sidewalk, the use of the rooftop, dancing, the
significantly late night hours and the lack of experience of the Applicant; and
viii. Whereas, the Applicant stating they will insulate the premises but provided no concrete plans
for such insulation, the existing insulation not proving to be sufficient over the years, the
applicant providing a sound review of the existing placement of all the speakers and
entertainment level sound system which have proved to be troublesome and not credible in
stating that the existing sound insulation is adequate; the Applicant not willing to reduce the
interior hours of operation for the premises but did agree to limit the hours on the rooftop until
midnight 7 days a week, the Applicant was not able to agree to having no sound generating
devices on the rooftop; and
ix. Whereas, this application being subject to the 500 Foot Rule requiring the Applicant to
demonstrate that the public interest would be served by the granting of the On-Premises
Liquor License at this location, there being 55 active licenses within 750 ft. and 5 pending
licenses according to LAMP; the hours being too late with the Applicant unwilling to reduce
them, there being no plans shown to properly insulate the premises for the type of
entertainment level sound that has been and is planned to be generated at the establishment,
the establishment located on the upper floors and rooftop of the building and containing
multiple windows on both the 2nd and 3rd floors, the rooftop use and late hours have been
already shown to cause additional significant quality of life issues for the surrounding
residents, added to that is the Applicants inexperience in running any type of licensed
establishment let alone a club with late hours, DJs and live music in the middle of a number
of colleges; and
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that Community Board 2, Manhattan recommends denial of
the application for an On-Premises Liquor License for RemyMidtown LLC 35 E 13th St aka
119-121 University Pl 10003; and
THEREFORE BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that should this application be considered by
the NYSLA, CB2, Manhattan respectfully requests that this item be calendared to appear before
the Full Board of the NYSLA.
Vote: Unanimous, 32 Board Members in favor.

TRAFFIC AND TRANSPORTATION
1. Resolution requesting pedestrian safety upgrades at the intersection of W. 10th St. and
Greenwich Ave. including Daylighting, signalization changes, curb management and
signage, and advocating a comprehensive study of all of Greenwich Ave. from 6th Ave. (Ave.
of the Americas) to 8th Ave.
Whereas on October 3, 2023, Lori Kleinman, a beloved community activist in Greenwich Village,
was struck and killed by a car turning left from eastbound W.10th St. onto northbound Greenwich
Ave. as she crossed Greenwich Ave. at that W. 10th St./Greenwich Ave. intersection; and
Whereas in the past 15 years or more, Greenwich Ave., once a quiet, easy-to-cross roadway, has
become a traffic-filled, disorganized and confusing thoroughfare, hampered by loading/unloading
and drop-off/pickup activities that engender double-parking, occupation of crosswalks and
disordered driving, endangering pedestrians on a daily basis; and
Whereas this unstable activity on Greenwich Ave. that challenges pedestrian safety each day is
further intensified on W. 10th St. by drivers speeding eastward from 7th Ave. S. without interference
right through Waverly Pl. to make the light on Greenwich Ave; and
Whereas many of these drivers on W. 10th St. turn with the green light at Greenwich Ave. while
sustaining the same excessive travel speed, oblivious in the absence of any clear line of sight of
the potential for hitting pedestrians crossing Greenwich, visibility being obstructed by the clutter
of parked and double-parked vehicles; and
79Whereas the traffic light timing at the Greenwich Ave./W. 10th St. intersection allows for a green
light for both motor vehicles turning from W. 10th into Greenwich and pedestrians crossing
Greenwich at the very same time, setting the stage for perilous pedestrian/vehicle conflicts; and
Whereas Transportation Alternatives (the pedestrian/bicycling safety advocacy group) presented
recommendations for pedestrian safety techniques to prevent the serious dangers to pedestrians
that now exist at and around the W. 10th St./Greenwich Ave. intersection, including:
• Leading Pedestrian Intervals (LPIs) - timing of lights used on traffic signals to give
pedestrians a head start in crossing the street (7 seconds at the minimum) before the light
turns green for turning drivers to enter that street.
• Daylighting – carving out street space abutting sidewalks (i.e., in curb lanes) near
intersections (typically next to crosswalks) to provide more visibility as vehicles turn from
one street into another. This customarily entails removing parking spaces close to the
intersection to make it easier for both drivers and pedestrians to see each other on both
sides of the turning corner.
• Neighborhood Loading Zones and other Commercial Loading Zones that allocate
designated curb space for loading and unloading and drop-offs and pickups that otherwise
might entail double-parking or taking up space in crosswalks by delivery trucks and other
vehicles.
• Installation of a STOP sign and a crosswalk at Waverly Pl. and W. 10th St. to halt and slow
down speeding drivers as they progress from 7th Ave. S. along W. 10th to the corner of
Greenwich Ave., not only giving safe crossing to pedestrians at Waverly and W. 10th, but
also creating a generally calmer, sustained pace that better safeguards pedestrians as these
drivers reach W. 10th and Greenwich.
• Raised crosswalks, i.e. platforms to cross the street that are level with the sidewalk
(sidewalk height above the street) and have regular crosswalk width and markings that are
highly visible and are similar to speed humps in the way they slow down approaching
vehicles by introducing inclines up from the streetbed and back down that in speed humps
curve at the top, while in raised crosswalks the inclines lead to a flat, level walkway; and
Whereas studies by both the National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO) and
the NYC Dept, of Transportation (DOT) show that left-turning vehicles cause serious injuries or
fatalities at over three times the rate of right-turning vehicles, borne out by the tragic death of Lori
Kleinman, who was hit and killed by a vehicle turning left from eastbound W. 10th St. to
northbound Greenwich Ave. According to these studies, a major reason why left turns are so
dangerous is a blind spot arising from the A-pillar (the vehicle’s roof support at the forward left
corner of the windshield) when a turn is made, limiting visibility. Daylighting the left (north) side
of W. 10th St. approaching Greenwich Ave. will increase visibility for left turns there; and
Whereas measures are needed to prevent trucks and other vehicles from parking in the Daylighted
spaces and blocking that needed visibility. Bollards are sometimes used to define and block such
spaces, but they would lack the flexibility needed to accommodate fire engines from Squad 18 at
132 W. 10th St. btw. Waverly Pl and Greenwich Ave. as they turn left from W. 10th to head north
80on Greenwich Ave. in what they consider their quickest route to put out fires. A preferred, more
flexible measure is placing planters in the Daylighted spaces (that also can provide attractive
enhancement while retaining the needed line of sight and, if necessary, can be moved aside); and
Whereas LPIs hold automotive traffic from making turns for several seconds at the start of the
pedestrian Walk phase, giving pedestrians discernable presence crossing the street before the
turning vehicles can enter but not offering a full pedestrian phase free of vehicles, thus exposing
those still crossing the street to moving vehicles and pedestrian-vehicle conflicts, while Split Phase
signalization consists of traffic light phases that fully separate pedestrian street crossings from the
movements of turning vehicles, providing greater pedestrian safety; and
Whereas existing conditions, e.g., the need to accommodate FDNY Squad 18 fire engines as they
turn left from W. 10th St. to head north on Greenwich Ave. to reach fires as quickly as possible, or
Greenwich Ave.’s designation as a truck route, preclude the installation of a raised crosswalk on
Greenwich Ave. or W. 10th, however, high visibility crosswalks at these crossings, with very
defined, visible patterns in reflective thermoplastic tape, with special pavement markings, signage
and lighting can help focus drivers’ attention on crossing pedestrians; and
Whereas there are conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists and motorists on all of Greenwich Ave
from 6th Ave. to 8th Ave., with particularly dangerous pedestrian crossings at the southwest
corner of 6th Ave. at Greenwich because of cars speeding up 6th Ave. and slipping into the
Greenwich northwest-bound lane; and at 7th Ave. S. and Greenwich because of the 5-way
intersection, in addition to the dangerous left turn from W. 10th St. onto Greenwich northbound
and hazardous turns at other similar intersections along Greenwich. This is compounded by the
variation in widths of Greenwich Ave. and the general plethora of activities and competitive needs,
e.g., large trucks on the two-way truck route and traffic going both ways, loading/unloading and
drop-off-pickups, bike riding, the fire engines on their emergency route, dining sheds and even a
bus turning right from W. 10th St. into Greenwich where it travels to W. 8th St. and turns in there;
Therefore be it resolved that Community Board 2 Manhattan (CB2) calls upon DOT to
immediately implement Daylighting for at least 20 ft. on the left (north) curbside lane of W. 10th
St. where W. 10th St. approaches its intersection with Greenwich Ave.; and
Be it further resolved that CB2 encourages DOT to install a planter or planters in the requested
Daylighted spaces and inscribe the planter(s) in memory of Lori Kleinman, and suggests that Ms.
Kleinman’s many loving friends and neighbors compose this inscription and that her devoted
fellow board members of the Jefferson Market Garden select the plantings and arrange for their
maintenance; and
Be it further resolved that CB2 urges DOT to change the traffic light signal phasing at the
intersection of Greenwich Ave. and W. 10th St. to a full split phase cycle that allows for a separate,
conflict-free, green light phase dedicated exclusively for pedestrians crossing Greenwich Ave. that
operates concurrently with a red light left-turn arrow for W. 10th St. that prevents vehicles from
turning left/north from W. 10th onto Greenwich at the same time the pedestrians are crossing, but
81with through traffic allowed to proceed east on W. 10th St. with a simultaneous green light pointing
ahead; and
Be it further resolved that CB2 requests the addition of loading zones where needed on
Greenwich Ave. and possibly W. 10th St. and asks that DOT observe loading/unloading and drop-
off/pickup activities along Greenwich Ave. and on W. 10th St. and confer in particular with
business owners to ascertain loading zone needs; and
Be it further resolved that CB2 supports installation of a STOP sign and a crosswalk at Waverly
Pl. and W. 10th St.; and
Be it further resolved that CB2 asks that DOT ensure that the high visibility crosswalks at W.
10th St. and Greenwich Ave. have the most defined, visible patterns available installed, in highly
reflective thermoplastic tape (refreshing this frequently), along with installation of Yield to
Pedestrians signage and/or STOP or YIELD pavement markings in advance of the marked
crosswalks, and overhead lighting placed to clearly illuminate pedestrian activity; and
Be it further resolved that CB2 strongly recommends that DOT conduct a comprehensive study
of all of Greenwich Ave. from 6th to 8th Aves., including in relation to its side streets, concentrating
on creating a safer Greenwich Ave. with shorter crossing distances and greater pedestrian
visibility, with consideration and evaluation of potential improvements suggested by community
members, such as relocation of the truck route, installation of an Open Street (and establishing a
program that ensures maintenance partners to operate it in a professional manner), converting from
two-way to one-way, putting in a bike lane, and conferring with FDNY Squad 18 (the local
firehouse rather than FDNY headquarters which DOT usually consults without receiving details
about local conditions and concerns) to address access and other needs as well as alternative
approaches for FDNY service; and
Be it finally resolved that CB2 implores DOT to install with utmost speed the simple, site specific
improvements CB2 recommends and requests in the area of concern at Greenwich Ave. and W.
10th St., including Daylighting with planters, split phase signalization, suitable loading zone
signage, a STOP sign and crosswalk at W. 10th St. and Waverly Pl., and well-defined, clearly seen
high visibility crosswalks, Yield to Pedestrians signage and street bed markings, with carefully
placed, effective lighting, to provide these sorely needed safeguards to pedestrians as quickly as
possible, well in advance of the requested comprehensive study which will take a much longer
time.
Vote: Unanimous, with 33 Board members in favor.
2. Resolution in support of co-naming the northwest corner of Waverly Pl. and Charles St.
(or alternatively, another area holding a street post that borders McCarthy Square) Frank
Crapanzano Way.
Whereas a great many friends and neighbors who have loved, admired and are grateful to Frank
Crapanzano for his many years of work both beautifying and creating a gathering place and sense
82of community at McCarthy Square (the verdant triangle on the east side of 7th Ave. S. formed by
7th Ave. S., Waverly Pl. and Charles St.) have gathered to request that the northwest corner of
Waverly Pl. and Charles St. (or another corner or spot holding a street post that borders McCarthy
Square) be co-named Frank Crapanzano Way to honor his memory and recognize his significant
contribution to enhancing community life; and
Whereas when Frank Crapanzano, a 45-year resident of 15 Charles St. in Greenwich Village,
retired from his position as a guidance counselor in a NYC public high school in 2006, he had
more time to look out the window from his 5th floor apartment and observe what was going on in
the surrounding community. What he saw was a sadly neglected little triangle park (McCarthy
Square) and he decided that he would take care of it; and
Whereas from 2006 until over 10 years later when he was no longer physically able (and even
then continued to be involved until his death in 2021), Frank Crapanzano devoted his time to
bringing McCarthy Square back to life, working every day for endless hours, single-handedly
cleaning out trash, weeding, and planting a beautiful array of flowers and greenery, most at his
own expense; and
Whereas Frank Crapanzano not only rejuvenated McCarthy Square’s physical beauty, and with it
created a welcoming warmth, but he also transformed it into a special community place by holding
events and installing displays that brought people together and enriched community life, e.g., on
Halloween he strung up pumpkins and other holiday decorations and invited local school children
for refreshments and entertainment, in June he put up lanterns, and at Christmastime, he served
hot chocolate and coffee along with setting up colorful Christmas ornamentations; and
Whereas in the spirit of the original aim of McCarthy Square and to revive its history, Frank
Crapanzano initiated the restoration and rededication of the 1943 monument (granite base and
flagpole) that was erected there during World War II, to recognize those who were serving in the
U.S. Armed Forces, at the time McCarthy Square was established and named for Bernard James
McCarthy, the first Villager to fall in battle in that war, on Guadalcanal, and Frank worked with
the American Legion and local residents to raise funds to support that effort. He also arranged for
a new plaque on the monument that paid homage to both the “Brave Men and Women who served
(women were not acknowledged on the original plaque). Thereafter, he held a ceremony every
Veterans Day which included a bugler playing taps, speeches and refreshments; and
Whereas a great many neighbors and community friends appeared to support the proposed co-
naming, including Vincent Mele, a talented carpenter who, at Frank’s invitation, created
birdhouses in a variety of architectural styles for the garden, Ralph Musolino, the Chief Operations
Officer of the NYC Dept. of Parks & Recreation (DPR) who at that time was District Manager for
the parks in Community Board 2, Manhattan (CB2) and praised Frank’s dedication, and Yurra
Sugarman, a poet and neighbor reading a tribute by another poet neighbor, Arlene Nauer, who
wrote “…our beloved gardener, Frank…buys all the plants and flowers and seeds…prunes them,
waters…dresses up the garden each and every holiday…all this from a volunteer we owe hugs and
cheer.”; and
83Whereas petitions with over 200 signatures from local residents and businesses from within CB2
and many additional non-qualifying signatures from people outside the CB2 district who have
admired and enjoyed Frank Crapanzano’s beloved haven were submitted in support of the co-
naming; and
Whereas the Frank Crapanzano co-naming proposal more than adequately meets the requirements
of CB2’s Street Co-Naming Guidelines; and
Whereas the NYC Dept. of Transportation’s (DOT) liaison to CB2 has indicated that the only
requirement for installing a street co-name sign is that it has to be on an existing street post; and
Whereas there are existing street posts bordering the McCarthy Square triangle at:
• Northwest corner of Waverly Pl. and Charles St. – This is the preferred location, but it
already has three signs: Waverly Pl., Charles St., and McCarthy Square, which appear to
leave no room for another street sign (with hopes that one more sign can be added).
• Eastern side of 7th Ave. S. btw. Waverly Pl. and Charles St.
• Northeast corner of 7th Ave. S. and Charles St.
Whereas CB2’s DOT liaison has indicated that DOT’s Borough Engineers have to survey the
location where a street co-name is requested and evaluate if it would work and therefore has
suggested that alternative co-naming locations at McCarthy Square be submitted;
Therefore be it resolved that CB2 wholeheartedly and enthusiastically supports co-naming either
the northwest corner of Waverly Pl. and Charles St., or as alternatives, the eastern side of 7th Ave.
S. btw. Waverly Pl and Charles St. or the northeast corner of 7th Ave. S. and Charles St. (or even
at the small post on the west side of Waverly Pl. btw. 7th Ave. and Charles St.) “Frank Crapanzano
Way.”

LANDMARKS
1. *560 Broadway – Application is to add 4 LED screens, set 3’ behind the windows, three on
Prince Street and one on Broadway.
11WHEREAS:
A. The building is an elegant SoHo building that has lately undergone a careful restoration;
and
B. The screens, three on Prince Street and one on Broadway, are 6’ X 12’, identical to the size
of the windows with the appearance of completely filling the window, and reading as one
continuous screen on the Prince Street façade; and
C. The screens are a total of 244 square feet, are proposed to be illuminated 24 hours and and
there is no regulation apart from vague, poorly enforced Department of Buildings
restrictions, that govern the level of illumination; and
D. There were no examples shown nor testimony offered of signs of similar size completely
filling the windows or having a similar total area in the district; and
E. The building’s historic integrity is degraded by the aggressive, large, illuminated screens;
and
F. There was considerable testimony from members of the public opposed to the application;
now
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that CB2, Man. recommends denial of the four large
illuminated screens as unsuitable to this distinguished historic SoHo building.
Vote: Unanimous, 31 Board members in favor.
2. *99 Wooster St. – Application is to install a non-illuminated double-sided sunbrella banner
on the 2nd floor facade.
WHEREAS:
A. The building is a carefully restored 25’ wide three-story historic fire house with the
handsome ground floor retail space distinguished from the upper natural brick facade in
non-historic black paint; and
B. The building is in a neighborhood of taller buildings and lies between two considerably
taller buildings; and
C. The black cloth 10” X 130” banner proposed to be hung at the second story is out of scale
with the building and introduces an intrusive modern element into the historic natural brick
area of the building; and
D. The identification of the business would be adequately served with a historic blade sign,
conforming to regulations, hung on the storefront.
12E. There was testimony from members of the public opposed to the application; now
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that CB2, Man. recommends:
A. Denial of the oversized banner hung at the second story; and
B. That there be a historic blade sign conforming to standard regulations hung on the shop
front.
Vote: Unanimous, 31 Board members in favor.
3. A resolution by Community Board 2 Manhattan expressing opposition to the demolition
of the Dapolito Center.
WHEREAS:
A. The Dapolito Center building, constructed in 1908 and modified over the years, is of
architectural and historic importance and is a building contributing to the historic and
cultural significance of the Greenwich Village Historic District Extension II; and
B. The Landmarks Law affords the building considerable protection from unsuitable
alteration and demolition, including “demolition by neglect”; and
C. At the creation of the Greenwich Village Historic District Extension II, the originally
proposed boundary of the district was altered in order to include the Center; and
D. The building is listed in the National Register of Historic Places; and
E. Together with the adjacent library building, the notable Keith Herring mural on the west
wall, the outdoor swimming pool, and the James J. Walker Park, the block is a welcome
open area serving a variety of recreational purposes in Greenwich Village and is across the
street from St. Luke’s Place, one of the best-preserved blocks of row houses in the city;
and
F. The building has been closed for 5 years and through the time of the closure and until
recently it was understood by the community, based on information from the City and
presentations to both the Parks and Landmarks Committees of CB2, that renovations would
be carried out and the building would reopen as a recreation center; and
G. At a meeting of Community Board 2 July 10, 2024, of Land Use and Parks Committees
concerning a new affordable housing building proposed for the block immediately south
of the Center, a Parks Department representative, brought forward a proposal for recreation
facilities in that building and that demolition of the Center was under consideration; and
13H. A resolution was subsequently passed by the Board endorsing the use of certain parts of
the apartment building for community recreational purposes and this affirmation was
grossly misrepresented by the Parks Department as endorsing the demolition of the
Dapolito Center; and
I. The Parks Commissioner later appeared in an onsite television interview explaining the
demolition, despite CB2 never supporting demolition; and
J. The CB2 Board has had no further communication from the Parks Department since the
meeting and there are no reports or engineering studies to support the necessity for
demolition in hand; and
K. The CB2 Landmarks Committee, through which any request for approval of alteration or
demolition of a building in a landmark district must pass, has had no notification; and
L. Concern has been expressed by members of the community, organizations concerned with
historic preservation, elected officials, and members of the CB2 Board about the proposed
demolition; and
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that Community Board 2 Manhattan recommends that New
York City restore the Dapolito Center in accordance with Landmarks Law and ensure the building
remain under city ownership and devoted to a civic purpose.
Vote: Passed, with 22 in favor, 5 opposed (R. Caccappolo, A. Fernandez, D. Gruber, R. Kessler,
F. Sigel), 3 abstaining (R. Sanz, E. Siegel, E. Smith), and no recusals.
LAND USE & HOUSING
1. 110 Christopher Street, south side between Bleecker and Bedford Streets. Application to
renew a prior BSA variance to permit certain commercial uses in the basement spaces of a
residential building. Application No. 16-93 BZ.
WHEREAS:
A. The revised application for 110 Christopher Street (BSA Cal # 16-93 BZ) was presented
to the committee by Carl A. Sulfaro, Esq., representing the Applicant.
B. The application to extend the terms of a Special Permit to allow an existing office and to
add an art gallery to the cellar of this building was previously heard by this committee in
March 2024.
C. 110 Christopher Street is a five-story multiple-dwelling building in an R6 district.
D. There are three cellar spaces covered by this application: Basement West, Basement
Central West, and Basement Central East.
14E. MCB2 passed a resolution in March 2024 with: a) no objection to the continuation of Use
Group 6B office space for Basement West; and b) a recommendation of denial of the
change from custom dressmaker (Use Group 6A) to art gallery / event space (Use Group
6C) for the Basement Central West and Central East spaces.
F. The Applicant has revised their application to ask for a change in allowable uses under the
new zoning from Use Group VII office spaces to also include Use Group VI (Retail) and/or
Use Group VI (Service).
G. According to the Applicant, the tenant for the Basement Central West and Basement
Central East spaces, an art gallery, vacated the space in July 2024.
H. Residents of the building testified at this meeting with their opposition to include retail
uses in addition to the previously permitted dressmaker and office space uses. The residents
cited their concern for retail with the potential to bring more traffic into the building, and
that a retail establishment might play music which could travel up the air shaft into the
residential
I. apartments. Additionally, residents pointed out that the building elevator goes to the
basement and is accessible to anyone in the basement or commercial spaces. The residents
have no problem with office uses.
J. 311 complaints on this building and previous testimony by residents of the building
included complaints about noisy gatherings, congregations in the air shaft, and smoking in
the air shaft.
K. The applicant did not provide new information in their revised application that would
justify the need to expand the allowable uses. Examples include: support from existing
tenants for the new allowable uses, proposed designs to make the space amenable to a retail
establishment, or a statement regarding efforts to lease the vacant commercial space with
their currently allowed uses.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that CB2 Manhattan:
A. Continues to have no objection to the continuation of office use within Use Group VII
under the new zoning.
B. Recommends denial of the change in use to include the more impactful Use Group VI
(Retail) and/or Use Group VI (Service) under the new zoning.
C. Recommends that access to the air shaft be made inaccessible from the commercial units
in the cellar, and that the doors between the commercial spaces and the rest of the basement
be locked.
Vote: Unanimous, 30 Board members in favor.
SLA LICENSING
15SLA 1 LICENSING
1. 558 Broadway LLC dba MOIC 558 Broadway 10012 (OP–Bar/Tavern) (Retail and Museum,
Lic ID #0370-24-120980, Legacy SN #6029366 according to LAMP) (Alteration Application:
Add cellar and second floor to licensed space. Change in method of operation Application: Alcohol
service until 12AM and allow liquor during private events)
A. WHEREAS, the Applicant and the Applicant’s Attorney appeared before Community Board
2, Manhattan’s SLA Licensing Committee #1 to present two applications, (1) the first an
alteration to add the cellar and second floor to the licensed premises and (2) the second a
change in method of operation to allow the service of alcohol until 12 AM daily and during
private events to their existing on-premises tavern liquor license which is currently only
licensed for a limited area on the ground floor only consisting of the area designated as the
café featuring ice cream, small bites, wine, beer, cocktails and shots; the ground floor café
located within a 3-story for profit commercial enterprise called the Museum of Ice Cream
(MOIC) operating as an experiential retail establishment and not as a true museum with a very
small tertiary retail component also on the ground floor in the Broadway entry area, MOIC
occupies the whole 3-story building including basement at 558 Broadway between Prince and
Spring Streets which is a block-through building with additional frontage and access from
Crosby Street, the premises had been previously unlicensed prior to 2019, the building
constructed in 1920 and located in NYC-LPC’s designated SoHo-Cast Iron Historic District
and the Special SoHo NoHo Mixed Use District; and
B. WHEREAS, the currently licensed area of the 3-story premises is limited to 4, 587 sq. ft., all
on the ground floor, consisting of a lobby café and gift shop with 1 bar and 4 seats, this area
pre-pandemic was open to the public but is now only for patrons with tickets for the size-
limited, timed tours of the exhibit beginning every 30 minutes, and an additional bar with zero
(0) seats in the exhibition tour waiting area in the rear of the 1st floor of the building with a
hallway connecting the two; the current license not permitting drinks in the cellar and 2nd floor
exhibition areas, ending the service of alcohol at 9 PM with the premises open until 12 AM
nightly as decided by the Members of the Authority in May/2020; and
C. WHEREAS, the applicant originally appeared in August/2019 with the full board of CB2,
Man. unanimously recommending denial of the application in September/2019; at the time
many neighborhood residents appeared at the hearing in opposition to the granting of the
license; specific concerns expressed in opposition focused on the potential for long waiting
lines outside the establishment based on the experience of other cities where “Museum of Ice
Cream” exhibits had opened, the licensing of such a large, previously unlicensed space and its
impact on quality of life and the transformative power of licensing this type of experiential
establishment on the character of the neighborhood; additional concerns were raised about the
mixing of alcohol and ice cream at what was presented as a experiential retail establishment
that would attract families with children as well as adults; and
16D. WHEREAS, in August/2019 at the CB2, Man. hearing, and in their submission for the 500'
hearing in November/2019, the applicant stated that liquor would be primarily used as
ingredients in mixed ice cream and ice cream drinks, however beer and wine would be
available separately, and that the interior exhibition tour waiting area towards the back of the
first floor for patrons waiting entry to the museum would mitigate any lines or crowds outside
the establishment with all waiting occurring indoors, and in their submission for the 500'
hearing in addressing the concerns regarding lines from CB2, Man. the applicant states “this
[CB2’s concern] ignores the Applicant’s confirmation that there will not be long lines outside,
and the use of the museum is ticketed and by reservation thus controlling the number of people
who come in each hour, and that there is holding space indoors for people to wait”; and
E. WHEREAS, at its full board meeting on May 27, 2020, the NYSLA approved the on-premises
liquor license application for 558 Broadway LLC under the condition that the licensed portion
of the premises close at 8 PM and that there would be no alcohol at private events; the applicant
asked for reconsideration of those two conditions by the SLA, stating that by closing the
licensed portion at 8 PM they were effectively closing the entire establishment because patrons
could not get to the unlicensed 2nd floor and cellar without passing through the licensed
premises; in their submission for reconsideration the applicant made a point of stating that “no
part of the 2nd floor or the cellar spaces were licensed… no guests would have any alcohol in
either of the two exhibit room floors or in any of the exhibition spaces” and proposed ending
alcohol service at 9 PM weekdays and 10 PM weekends with closing hours of 11 PM
weekdays and 12 AM weekends and to be permitted to have alcohol at private events; the
Members of the Authority voting that the service of alcohol would end by 9 PM daily with no
restriction on closing hours and that there would remain no alcohol at private events, that the
café area itself was small while the total capacity of the premises is over 150 persons and that
the prior decision was a compromise that was good for the community; and
F. WHEREAS, the (1) first application is an alteration application to expand the premise to
license the entire 3-story premises, expanding the currently licensed premises from
approximately 4,587 sq. ft. to 15,187 sq. ft., there will be no wait staff, but patrons will be able
to carry drinks purchased on the ground floor to the 2nd floor and cellar;
G. WHEREAS, the (2) second application is for a change in method of operation to expand the
hours of service of alcohol from 9 PM until 10:30 PM nightly during normal operations, in
addition they are requesting the service of alcohol at private events with service during private
events ending at 12 AM any day of the week there is an event; and,
H. WHEREAS, an additional change from what was originally presented to CB2, while not
defined as a change in method of operation, the café menu found online for 2024 lists shots of
rum, gin, vodka and whiskey which is in contrast to the 500' submission by the applicant stating
that liquor would primarily be used as ingredients in mixed ice cream accompanied by wine
and beer service; and
17I. WHEREAS, numerous residents and the local block association appeared in opposition to the
instant application for both changes, the overarching complaint being that of long lines of
patrons on the sidewalk on a regular basis with the current operation, Broadway already being
a busy pedestrian thoroughfare with the regularly-occurring lines making the sidewalk
impassable, the exit of the premises being adjacent to the entrance so as the groups of people
rotate through it is not just those waiting to enter but also those exiting adding to the congestion,
there being many patrons with strollers, long lines of children and camp groups during the
summer, residents saying that staff is outside but the lines are not contained and contrary to
what was promised initially, there is no “holding” area inside to prevent the lines from forming;
the stanchions placed outside block about half of the sidewalk area in front of the premises so
on the occasions where there are no patrons waiting the sidewalk is still blocked, some
residents citing the MOIC pink stickers that are all over the sidewalks, there are buses that
bring groups of patrons that park, idling for hours under residents apartments, there were also
complaints about the garbage placed on Crosby Street which is frequently filled with melted
ice cream that runs out of non-liquid proof garbage containers further down the block, leaving
a sticky mess and attracting rats; additional concerns were raised that what has kept the
nuisance mostly manageable was the liquor service hours ending early and no alcohol at events,
with the requested later service of alcohol, and with alcohol at events, with those events having
a capacity of up to 150 persons, the venue will create further quality of life disturbances to the
neighboring residents into all hours of the evening, the applicant already unable to demonstrate
the ability to control the lines and now requesting alcohol service at events stating it will help
bring in more corporate, team-building events among other things, there being no plan to
manage large crowds arriving and departing from an event other than that they would figure it
out; the frontage on Broadway only being 27 feet wide thereby spilling over any large crowds
for Ubers and Lyfts from the corporate attendees at arrival or departure beyond the premises
frontage, the addition of alcohol likely to increase the number of evening events extending the
disturbance to residents and those using Broadway into much later hours; and
J. WHEREAS, the applicant stating they had to close the entry holding area during the Covid
pandemic which was where the public could enter without a waiver allowing guests to be
checked in on the interior of the premises and move to the back of the first floor exhibition
holding area but stating they have no plans to reopen the front entry to the general public, that
area now also being for ticketed guests only meaning tickets and waivers need to be checked
outside of the premises, there being no plan for how to alleviate the lines outside, stating
corporate events would be more streamlined due to waiver releases being the responsibility of
the corporation and submitted before the event but unable to answer how names would be
checked quickly at the door with so many people arriving at one time when they couldn’t
manage the current day to day operations without incurring lines, additionally there was no
traffic plan regarding for-hire vehicles for arriving and departing guests during events to the
narrow Broadway frontage of only 27 feet; the requested alteration and change in method of
operation combined with the applicant’s current inability to manage the exterior negative
quality of life impacts to the neighboring residents and those others who use the Broadway
sidewalk on a daily basis will likely extend the negative impacts on residents from being mostly
18a daytime / early evening problem into all hours of the evening, the applicant being unable to
show any concrete plans for alleviating those impacts; and
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that CB2, Man. recommends denial of the alteration and
change in method of operation application to the on-premises liquor license for 558 Broadway,
LLC dba MOIC, 558 Broadway 10012; and
THEREFORE, BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that should this application be considered by
the SLA, CB2, Man, respectfully requests that this item be calendared to appear before the Full
Board of the SLA.
Vote: Unanimous, 30 Board Members in favor.

sidewalk seating would close no later than 10 PM; and
E. WHEREAS, the applicant currently has sidewalk seating on Crosby Street described by the
applicant as being within the property line as part of the instant application, that sidewalk
seating in fact being on public property and not within the building line and misrepresented by
the applicant at the inception of the current tavern wine license, concerns were raised by
members of the Broadway Residents Coalition who live across the street and a block away
regarding the current sidewalk seating being operated under the temporary Open Restaurants
program, those residents providing copies of a recently expired revocable consent for two
sidewalk stairways within two fenced-in areas on the Crosby Street sidewalk to the north and
south of the proposed “within the property line” sidewalk café seating to allow for proper
basement/cellar egress, the proposed sidewalk café being between those two fenced in areas,
that area being adjacent to/between the two fenced in areas and therefore clearly also outside
the property line, the Applicant having nothing that demonstrates the proposed sidewalk café
area is within the property line, the Applicant was given the revocable consent agreement by
the block association when they appeared before CB2, Man. for their SLA application in
July/2021 showing that the above grade sidewalk area was part of the public sidewalk and not
within the property line; the Applicant appearing unaware of the situation and unwilling to
remove the sidewalk seating from the instant application, the seating area not conforming with
the regulations for Dining Out NYC because it is raised above the level of the sidewalk; and
F. WHEREAS, residents and the local block association also raising concerns that the Applicant
built wooden seating around the two tree pits on Crosby Street thereby encouraging patrons to
sit in the furnishing zone which is prohibited from having seating under the Dining Out NYC
program, further congesting the very narrow sidewalk passageway with servers using the
sidewalk area for service to patrons seated on the elevated sidewalk across from the tree pits,
the benches placed against the trees also constricting rain water from going down to the trees,
the Applicant also placing a bench for seating on Broome Street in derogation of the executed
stipulation agreement stating that any exterior seating would be on Crosby Street only; and
G. WHEREAS, the local residents and block association did not have an issue with the proposed
INTERIOR operations provided the existing stipulations regarding the interior operations
remained unchanged but felt strongly that as a condition for any on-premises full liquor license
that the applicant should agree to immediately remove the benches they installed around the
tree pits, remove the non-compliant sidewalk seating on Crosby Street and remove the illegal
bench seating from Broome Street from the instant application, the applicant not able to
provide any documentation that the proposed sidewalk seating was within the property line,
the Applicant stating they would get rid of the seating around the tree pit, yet to date has not
done so, that seating never being permitted under the temporary Open Restaurant program, and
20H. WHEREAS, during this month’s CB2, Manhattan’s SLA #1 Licensing Committee Meeting
on September 3, 2024, the Applicant chose to withdraw the application before CB2, Man.

instant application, affirming that they will not submit this application to the NYSLA for
consideration without returning to CB2 Man. should they decide to proceed at some time in
the future; and
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that Community Board 2, Manhattan strongly recommends
that the NYSLA deny any type of proposed on-premises liquor license, tavern wine license,
restaurant wine license, any other beer and wine license, corporate change, change in method of
operation, alteration, transfer or other changes to any existing license for Festive & Co Crosby

A. WHEREAS, the Applicant appeared before Community Board 2, Manhattan’s SLA Licensing
Committee #2 to present an application for an alteration to their existing restaurant wine license
to remove three (3) tables with six (6) seats and replace them with one (1) bar with six (6)
seats, the premises being located on a residential block (R6 zone) within a five (5)-story
residential building (ca. 1871) on Cornelia Street between West 4th and Bleecker Streets
(Block #589/Lot #17), the building falling withing NYC LPC’s designated Greenwich Village
Historic District Extension II; and;
B. WHEREAS, the ground floor restaurant is roughly 1,500 sq. ft. with 750 sq. ft. on the ground
floor connected to a 450 sq. ft. basement by an interior staircase, there is no patron use of the
basement, and a rear yard with 350 sq. ft., there will be eight (8) tables and 18 seats and one
bar with eight (8) seats for a total interior seated occupancy of 26 seats; and
C. WHEREAS, the current hours of operation for the interior of the restaurant have been from
Tuesday to Friday from 5PM to 11PM and Saturday to Monday from 11AM to 11PM, all doors
closing at 9 PM every night except for patron ingress and egress; there are no operable
windows, music will be quiet background only consisting of music from ipod/CDs/streaming
services, there are no DJs, no promoted events, no scheduled performances or cover fees, no
velvet ropes, and no movable barriers; and
D. WHEREAS, the application also includes the use of the rear yard consisting of seven (7)
tables and 22 seats; a Letter of No Objection (LNO) was not provided by the Applicant to CB2,
Man. as part of the original application in November/2018; however it was noted on the NYC
DOB website that a Letter of No Objection was issued for the interior only on October 3, 2018
at this address; the premises being located in an R6 (residential only) zone, the interior ground
floor restaurant being a previously-existing, non-conforming (commercial) use in a residential-
only zoned area, such non-conforming use not being permitted to expand including expansion
into the rear yard, the Applicant still not able to provide a LNO or Certificate of Occupancy
showing that the rear yard can be used for eating and drinking; and
E. WHEREAS, the Licensee is currently operating in dereliction and contravention of their
existing executed stipulations signed on 11/12/2018 which were agreed to as a specific
condition of the license and part of their method of operation for use of the rear yard that the
Licensee would “obtain permit/LNO which specifically indicates rear yard use in residential
only R6 zoning”; and
F. WHEREAS, there is a fire escape for the rear apartments in the building which drops down
directly into the rear yard dining area, the applicant presenting photographs of the interior rear
yard which is enclosed with tall, solid wooden fencing, yet omitting photographs of the roof
29consisting of what appears to be metal slats that the applicant installed, the roof obstructing the
emergency egress of the fire escape; the applicant stating that the roof is a temporary structure,
concerns being raised that the structure poses a safety hazard to the residents of the building
by blocking the emergency egress and that there is still nothing showing that the use of the rear
yard is permitted or that there were permits issued for the rear yard construction; and
G. WHEREAS, in addition to the alteration application the applicant is changing the DBA name
of the business and is also requesting to extend the hours of operation to 12 AM 7 days a week
from 11 PM, the local block associations (Central Village Block Association, Carmine Street
Block Association and West Village Residents Association) not having met with the applicant
regarding the instant application but have met with them on their neighboring establishments,
support the 12 AM closing provided that means all patrons have left by that time, that there is
no use of the rear yard and that there is no sidewalk or roadbed seating, concerns being raised
that the alteration, which does not add seating but instead swaps table seating for bar seating
at the front, outward/street-facing part of the restaurant, will set more of an evening bar tone
to the premises as opposed to the previous restaurant-only operation, in addition to the
requested extension of hours; and
H. WHEREAS, members of the board having concerns with the extension of hours until 12 AM
on Sundays through Thursdays in conjunction with the change to bar seating at the front of the
premises, this being a very quiet, small residential block; the applicant not able to show the use
of the rear yard is permitted and that their enclosure of the rear yard does not impede with the
emergency egress of the residents of the building yet being unwilling to remove the rear yard
from the instant application and return to add it if and when it can be shown that the use of the
rear yard for a non-conforming eating and drinking establishment in a residentially-zone
building is permitted; and
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that CB2, Man. recommends denial of the alteration
application to the existing restaurant wine license for 20 Cornelia LLC dba Cora fka Silver

0267-24-132057) (previously unlicensed)
A. WHEREAS, the Applicants and their Attorney appeared before Community Board 2,
Manhattan’s SLA Committee #2 to present an application to the NYS Liquor Authority for
new Tavern Wine Liquor License to operate a neighborhood coffee café in a corner, ground
floor storefront located within a four-story, residential apartment building (circa 1949) at the
corner of Hudson and Perry Streets; this building falling within NYC LPC’s designated
Greenwich Village Historic District; and
B. WHEREAS, the storefront proposed to be licensed was previously operated since 2017 as
a fitness studio, and before that for decades as a dry cleaner, the corner storefront having never
previously operated for eating and drinking or licensed for the service of alcohol, the interior
ground floor premises is roughly 900 sq. ft., with a set of stairs leading to 500 sq. ft. basement
(basement for storage purposes only), there is no full-service kitchen, the menu featuring
coffee, pastries, crepes along with cold food offerings and wine, the Applicant seeking to
operate on the adjoining public sidewalks on Hudson and Perry Streets for a total of 21 tables
and 42 exterior patrons seats, the application showing there may be heating elements used in
conjunction with the sidewalk seating, the applicant stating at the CB2, Man. hearing that they
have removed the exterior seating from the instant application stating that they will be filing
for it once they complete the Dining Out NYC application process but that it should not be
considered as part of the instant application at this time, the exterior seating exceeding the
number of patron seats for the interior, the interior seating being an additional 17 tables and 34
seats and one bar with 5 seats for a total interior occupancy of 39 patrons, with only 1 public
bathroom to serve all patrons both interior and exterior, the store front infill being fixed without

performances, no cover fees, and no televisions; and
D. WHEREAS, the addition of 42 exterior seats on the public sidewalks on Perry and Hudson
Streets, is excessive and inappropriate for this residential neighborhood and while not part of
31the instant application, it was originally submitted as part of the instant application and
removed at the last minute and should be considered as part of the impact of licensing the
premises, especially on Perry Street, where no such exterior seating for the service of alcohol
has ever previously existed, and where residents live immediately above and adjacent to the
proposed exterior seating, the Perry Street sidewalk not being of appropriate depth to
accommodate the numbers of seats proposed, and the service aisle, while also allowing for the
proper passage of pedestrians; and
E. WHEREAS, there was substantial opposition to this Application from residents living on
Perry Street and on Hudson Street, as well as the local block association, the objections raised
focused both on the over-saturation of liquor licenses in the immediate vicinity, with the
number of exterior seats on Hudson and Perry Streets being overwhelming, the immediate area
already being inundated with licensed premises both next door and within the same building
and across the streets, with all four storefronts on Hudson Street within this same building
being for the service of alcohol, there being another café directly across the street on the
southeast corner of Perry and Hudson Streets being very similar in nature (Café Kitsune Inc &
CK Hudson LLC Lic ID # 0267-21-116844) serving breakfast, coffee, tea and wine in addition
to sandwiches and salads yet closing at an earlier hour (9 PM) which is more aligned with the
method of operation of a coffee café such as the instant application serving lite bites, coffee
and wine; there being multiple late night restaurants located within a block of the instant
application (Café Kitsune Inc & CK Hudson LLC Lic ID # 0267-21-116844, Francis Louis

F. WHEREAS, the Applicants when confronted with these objections not being willing to
compromise as to hours of operation to be more aligned with other coffee shops in the area or
to reduce or eliminate the sidewalk seating on Perry Street, additionally the applicants did not
have a plan for soundproofing the premises, simply stating it would be soundproof, the resident
living directly above the premises expressing their concern about noise from the premises
being heard in their home from 7 AM until after 12 AM; and
G. WHEREAS, no one appeared in favor of the application from the Community, the
applicant’s attorney stating that their other licensed premises are similar in nature with
residences above and surrounding the premises yet those establishments are located on West
56th Street and Columbus Avenue, both of which are heavily-trafficked four or five lane streets
with larger buildings being very different in nature from the character of Hudson and Perry
Streets with Perry and West 11th Street being three lanes with one traffic lane and either parking
32or no parking in the other two lanes and the buildings being primarily three to four stories with
none as tall as those in the applicants other locations; and
H. WHEREAS, legitimate questions having been raised about the significant impacts caused
by the excessive number of patrons being served alcohol to the above-referenced exterior areas
surrounded by residences, where no such service has ever existed previously, with this part of
Hudson Street already being overwhelmed by the service of alcohol to the sidewalks and
roadbeds running along this roadway, and the method of operation for this particular
application as a coffee shop and wine bar being one focused on the service of alcohol, there
being so many other wine bars already sited within this area, and throughout Greenwich
Village; and
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that CB2, Man. recommends denial of the Restaurant Wine

WHEREAS, the Lululemon store and the tents placed outside the store are meant to be a “home
base” for 300+ runners each Saturday who are going on runs throughout the city in preparation for
the New York marathon; and
WHEREAS, according to neighbors in the area, the applicant has already been organizing such
run clubs on Saturday mornings over the last few weeks, ahead of receiving a SAPO permit, and
have been beginning extremely early in the mornings, generating loud noise, playing music and
disrupting / waking neighbors; and
WHEREAS¸ the applicant was not willing to consider basing such a run club in another location,
even though there are other Lululemon stores in downtown Manhattan that would make
53significantly more sense as a base for running, such as the Meatpacking and Battery Park City
stores; and
WHEREAS¸ while the applicant stated that they encourage runners to gather inside the store and
to spend minimal time in the tents outside ahead of beginning the run, there does not seem to be a
suitable way to gather hundreds of people on the street at such an hour without generating a
negative impact on residents in the area, as well a similar negative impact when the runners return
en masse to their location after the run; now

TRAFFIC AND TRANSPORTATION
1. Resolution requesting a continuous bus route moving both north and south of W. 14th St.
along Route 9A, by extending the M12 bus route south of W. 14th St., preferably to
Chambers St.
61WHEREAS the Hudson River Park (HRP) sits adjacent to Route 9A and receives 17 million
visitors annually, but MTA NYC Transit (NYCT) does not provide a 9A bus route between major
venues along 9A like Little Island and Pier 40 in Community Board No. 2 Manhattan (CB2) and
connecting them to Chelsea Piers, Pier 57, and to other points north or south, yet tour bus
companies operate and have stops along 9A, including a new stop between Houston and Spring
Sts. beside the new Google building; and
WHEREAS it has been increasingly recognized that there's a need for a continuous public bus
route that connects the entire length of the HRP, but there's no such service below W. 14th St.; and
WHEREAS resolutions from neighboring community boards along 9A and the HRP Advisory
Council document that the HRP Greenway, America’s busiest bikeway, is unsafe for slower riders
such as young children and the elderly, and a bus route would provide a safe alternative for them
to get from place to place along 9A and comfortably access the HRP's many facilities (as it would
for all users); and
WHEREAS organizations such as the Downtown United Soccer Club and the Greenwich Village
Little League have requested a public bus route to provide access to ballfields along the 9A route,
including the Gansevoort Peninsula and Pier 40 within CB2, citing the long walk from 8th Ave.,
and Little Island supports a bus route to improve access for seniors and families with children; and
WHEREAS Route 9A's design originated before the HRP existed, when manufacturing and
shipping dominated buildings that now house thousands of residents and high-end hotels joined by
substantial new construction for residential and commercial uses, and the Meatpacking District,
once industrial, is now a vibrant hub for art and nightlife with institutions like the Whitney
Museum and connections to the High Line all along the 9A route; and
WHEREAS all this new activity and dense residential settlement calls for a public bus route to
provide direct, continuous and reliable access and transport for these many new Far West Side
populations neighboring 9A and the HRP in addition to serving the manifold HRP users; and
WHEREAS the closest public transportation (affordable) access below W. 14th St. for West St.
(Route 9A) and the HRP is at 8th Ave. subway stops, a long distance to walk and especially
challenging for seniors, families and children; and
WHEREAS the M12 bus goes north from W. 14th St. on 11th and then 12th Ave. following a
route adjacent to the HRP up to W. 57th St. with the potential for a logical and easy extension of
the route south on 9A; and
WHEREAS MTA NYCT is currently in the process of bus network redesigns for Queens and
Brooklyn, and the Manhattan bus network study and redesign is anticipated to ensue following
that, however, the simple process of extending the M12 south of W. 14th St. on Route 9A to fill in
the existing gap and the extensive, constantly growing and urgent need for service there does not
require a study or network change; and
62WHEREAS the irregularity of the M12 bus service where it now exists on 11th and 12th Aves.
above W. 14th St. as well as the need for frequent and reliable bus service along a 9A route has
been noted by members of the communities adjacent to Route 9A;
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that CB2 calls upon MTA NYCT to immediately implement
a continuous bus route moving both north and south of W. 14th St. along one of New York’s most
traveled residential and tourist corridors, i.e., Route 9A, by extending the M12's route (which now
proceeds north of W. 14th St. to W. 57th St.) south of W. 14th St., preferably to Chambers St.; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that CB2 urges that MTA NYCT establish a frequent and
consistent schedule for this much needed 9A north-south route, especially during peak hours,
with buses arriving at 10-minute intervals.
Vote: Unanimous, 30 Board Members in favor.
2. Request for a study addressing the hazardous conditions at Mulry Sq. (the intersection of
7th Ave. S., Greenwich Ave. and W. 11th St.) to identify and implement solutions to
safeguard crossing pedestrians and clarify vehicular movement, including design,
signalization, and pavement marking changes.
“There is no logic that can be superimposed on the city; people make it, and it is to them … that
we must fit our plans” - Jane Jacobs
WHEREAS Mulry Square, the complex intersection where 7th Ave. S., Greenwich Ave. and
W.11th St. meet, forming six different spokes of converging traffic lanes, has long been a
problematic street configuration that both endangers and confuses pedestrians trying to navigate
its divergent crossings; and
WHEREAS for many years, at least going back to the 1990s, various attempts to improve
conditions at the Mulry intersection have been made, e.g., neckdowns (sidewalk corner extensions)
were installed to shorten street crossings, crosswalks were reworked and traffic signals changed;
reversing W. 11th St. btw. 6th Ave. and 7th Ave. S. was also considered but not done; and
WHEREAS an early study revealed that an exceptionally large number of pedestrians were
crossing 7th Ave. S. in the unmarked, non-signalized, and very lengthy (and therefore dangerous)
expanse btw. the southeast corner of 7th Ave. S. at the southwest side of Greenwich Ave. and the
northwest corner of Greenwich Ave., 7th Ave. S. and W. 11th St., following their desire lines for
the most direct, efficient route to continue north (or vice versa) on Greenwich Ave. (on its western
sidewalk) in a straight, logical direction; and
WHEREAS at some point (estimated to be around 2017-2019) a crosswalk with zebra-striped
markings was installed that followed these desire lines, along with corresponding changes in traffic
signalization, officially formalizing and providing safety measures at the 7th Ave. S. crossing btw.
the southeast corner of 7th Ave. S. at the southwest side of Greenwich Ave. and the northwest
63corner of Greenwich Ave., 7th Ave. S. and W. 11th St. This crossing was (and is) parallel with the
7th Ave. S. zebra striped crossing btw. the northeast corner of 7th Ave. S. at W. 11th St. and the
northeast corner of Greenwich Ave. on the northwest side of 7th Ave. S., leading north on
Greenwich Ave.'s eastern sidewalk; and
WHEREAS within that same timeframe when the 7th Ave. S. crosswalk btw. the southwest and
the northwest sides of Greenwich Ave. was installed, the crosswalk traversing 7th Ave. S. btw. the
southeast side of 7th Ave. S. at the southwest side of Greenwich Ave. and the southwest side of
7th Ave. S. and W. 11th St. (and vice versa) was removed along with its corresponding
signalization, thereby creating a void where, similar to the previously unregulated 7th Ave. S.
crossing btw. the north and south of Greenwich Ave., pedestrians now cross without safety
measures; and
WHEREAS it has been observed by constituents who live nearby and walk the Mulry intersection
regularly that pedestrians will continue to follow both these pathways with or without crosswalks
and signalization, and measures are required that respond to their needs and provide safeguards;
and
WHEREAS there are concerns that vehicular traffic heading west from W. 11th St. that needs to
jog south across 7th Ave. S. to continue further west on W. 11th St. directly crosses the 7th Ave.
S. crosswalk that is btw. the southwest and northwest sides of Greenwich Ave., with the potential
for pedestrian/vehicular conflicts there that call for a thorough analysis of signalization and
adjustments where necessary; and
WHEREAS southbound vehicles on 7th Ave. S. have the green light and/or a green left turn arrow
to Greenwich Ave. at the same time pedestrians have a red light for the north/south W. 11th St.
crossing on the east side of 7th Ave. S., although there's no conflict at this W. 11th crossing with
the vehicles going south on Greenwich Ave. and on 7th Ave. S.; and
WHEREAS constituents who frequently use this intersection attested to the confusing, chaotic
and dangerous conditions, with some suggesting that a Barnes Dance (also called Scramble), in
which all vehicular traffic stops at once, and pedestrians can cross in any direction, should be
considered; and
WHEREAS constituents also have observed how faded the crosswalk markings are, with some
barely visible, and pointed to the need to refurbish them to provide needed clarity;
Therefore be it resolved that Community Board No. 2 Manhattan (CB2) urges the NYC Dept. of
Transportation (DOT) to speedily conduct a thorough study of the Mulry Sq. intersection and the
movements, interactions and conflicts that occur there that affect the safety and well-being of
pedestrians as well as of the confusing pattern of directional motifs that hinders the safe conduct
of bicycles and motor vehicles, to once and for all create a clear and well-coordinated framework
of design, pavement markings, signalization and signage that guides all users safely and easily
through; and
64BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that CB2 requests that DOT include the following objectives as
part of this much needed study:
• Restoration of the crosswalk traversing 7th Ave. S. btw. the southeast side of 7th Ave. S.
at the southwest side of Greenwich Ave. and the southwest side of 7th Ave. S. and W. 11th
St.
• Retention of the crosswalk traversing 7th Ave. S. btw. the southeast corner of 7th Ave. S.
at the southwest side of Greenwich Ave. and the northwest corner of Greenwich Ave., 7th
Ave. S. and W. 11th St. (i.e., the 7th Ave. S. crossing btw. the southwest and northwest
sides of Greenwich Ave.)
• Provision for a green light phase for the north/south W. 11th St. crossing on the east side
of 7th Ave. S. at the same time southbound vehicles on 7th Ave. S. have the green light
and/or a green left turn arrow to Greenwich Ave.
• Consideration of a possible Barnes Dance (Scramble) for the intersection.; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that CB2 asks that DOT refurbish the Mulry Sq. crosswalks with
fresh paint right now to give clear visibility of the current paths and reduce some of the confusion
until more effective improvements are installed.
Vote: Unanimous, 30 Board Members in favor.
STANDING COMMITTEE REPORTS WITHOUT RESOLUTIONS
HUMAN SERVICES
Office of the Special Narcotics Prosecutor for the City of New York (OSNP)
This office was created 50 years ago by the New York State Legislature and is unique in the
country in that it has jurisdiction for felony narcotics offenses throughout the five boroughs
(counties) of New York City. The prosecutor is appointed by the city’s five District Attorneys. Its
grand jury sits in Manhattan. Ms. Brennan has served as its director for 25 years.
The mission of the office is to focus on cases of citywide impact, such as those involving large
criminal organizations. The premise of its approach is that cutting off supply can lead to reduced
drug usage and reduced financial gain from the drug industry.
The office generally collaborates with investigative organizations: NYPD, DEA, Homeland
Security, ie.
Felony offenses are those that carry sentences of more than a year in prison. The sale of drugs is a
felony. Possession of a large amount of drugs is also a felony.
Narcotics include fentanyl, heroin, cocaine, opioid pills. They do not include methamphetamine
or cannabis unless those are together with a narcotic drug.
Narcotics are a subset of a larger group of controlled substances. (Cannabis is no longer illegal,
but when it was it was its own category.)
65The OSNP does not handle misdemeanors, which are managed by the DA’s office. An example of
a misdemeanor is possession of drugs of a small weight that is consistent with personal use rather
than sales.
TRENDS IN CB2
Brennan shared a map showing arrests for drug sales in CB2 for 2023 and 2024. The 6th precinct
of NYPD made 62 arrests for drug sales in 2023. So far in 2024 it has already made 88 arrests.
These are concentrated along 6th Avenue, West 3rd St, near Minetta Lane, etc. (The map did not
show activity in the Meatpacking District but it is not clear that data from there was included in
the map.) Brennan interprets this activity to indicate that there is more effort being spent on
stopping drug activity in CB2.
In February of 2024 the OSNP did some work in the area of Washington Square Park and made
some arrests, but in general it works farther north and not in our area.
A map of arrests for misdemeanor drug possession covers a larger area, concentrated along 6th
Avenue, WSP, and farther north. The number of arrests for 2023 is comparable to the number of
arrests in the first six months of 2024. Again, Brennan interprets this to mean that the precinct is
concentrating more of its resources on drug activity.
The largest growth in types of drug, by far, is fentanyl and cocaine. The 6th precinct also saw
pharmaceutical drugs such as oxycodone, some hallucinogens. Its list does not include heroin.
FENTANYL
Fentanyl is a synthetic opiate and much cheaper to produce than cocaine or heroin, which are plant-
based and must be harvested and refined. It stays in the body’s system briefly and users must often
use several times a day. It is powerful and very dangerous. Fentanyl is mainly being produced in
Mexico with chemicals from China. It is trucked across the southwest border in heavy loads that
come into the Bronx. It is offloaded in the Bronx and then transported for bagging and
redistribution. From New York it is shipped to Pennsylvania, Maryland, and elsewhere.
Some readers may recall the news story of kilos of fentanyl hidden in a compartment under a
daycare center in the Bronx, resulting in the death of a child.
There is also a dangerous social media market for illegal pills. These are highly dangerous: very
good counterfeit versions of Oxycodone, Adderall, Xanax, and all likely to contain fentanyl.
A freshman student at Brooklyn Tech High School died last year after ingesting fentanyl.
OTHER DRUGS
“Tranq” is actually xylazine, an animal tranquilizer not approved for human use. It is a sedative,
and like Fentanyl has a sedating effect on the body. It is not responsive to Narcan – Narcan is only
effective on opioids – and it causes skin abscesses. OSNP is seeing it in the drug supply now.
66OVERDOSES
80% of drug overdose deaths in NYC are related to fentanyl.
Overdose deaths in NYC are higher in the first six months of 2024 than they were in all of 2022
or 2023.
There were just four OD deaths in the 6th precinct between January and October of 2023 and their
locations does not suggest a specific pattern. When there are clusters of deaths, this often indicates
to OSNP that there is a cluster of drug dealers in the area and it will focus attention there to reduce
deaths. Brennan guesses that the training of Narcan use and its wide distribution is also
contributing to overdoses that do not result in death.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
DRUG USE SPILLOVER EFFECTS:
CB2: Is there a correlation between hotspots of drug usage and other serious crime?
Brennan and Solomon: We see a correlation with crime in areas that have high drug usage. You
can see it in the 25th precinct and in the 28th and even in the 6th: shoplifting, grand larceny, thefts,
low level drug dealing, theft of Amazon deliveries, car break-ins, burglaries. Fentanyl goes through
the body quickly and people use multiple times a day. They don’t have jobs or money to pay for
drugs, and they’re not going to get them for free, and they have to get the money somehow.
IMPACT OF OVERDOSE PREVENTION CENTERS
CB2: We’ve heard about two safe injection sites in Manhattan operated by OnPoint, on West 180th
St and on 104 East 126th St. This approach seems like good solution to preventing overdose deaths.
What is your opinion of these?
Brennan and Solomon: Many people in the [Harlem] community have been quite vocal. There is
a daycare center across the street from the safe injection facility. Around the corner is a methadone
clinic. We’ve received a lot of complaints about open drug selling, and about the concentration of
services in the area tailored to drug users. The area attracts drug dealers, and users don’t always
go indoors. They use on the street, and in the subway station, and Marcus Garvey Park. This area
is covered by the 25th precinct of NYPD and the number of overdose deaths has increased.
The site on West 180th Street in Washington Heights is less vocal and doesn’t have the level of
community organizing that East Harlem has. The biggest complaints regard a school that is two
blocks away. The precinct reports a concentration of drug usage in the area, in a playground across
the street, under scaffolding on the street. Users gather at night to buy drugs. The precinct generally
sends a car out before school hours to clear out the area for the protection of children.
CB2: Is the problem that these harm reduction centers are clustered in areas? They are next to a
methadone clinic, they are in vulnerable communities where there is already high rates of drug
activity. I spoke to someone who was a former prosecutor who felt that if there were MORE
overdose prevention centers, that it might reduce those vicious circles. What do you think?
Brennan: There is really no research that supports the idea that supervised injection sites reduce
overdose deaths. In Vancouver, Canada, where they began, overdose rates have escalated.
67One problem is that they are not legal so they don’t answer to anyone. The sites in NYC are under
nobody’s supervision - neither the city’s Department of Health nor the state’s. You don’t want that
kind of structure. The fallout for the neighborhood just doesn’t make sense to me.
Rhode Island is one state where the legislature has passed a statute outlining a structure, selecting
a site. The site is in a relatively isolated area and has all kinds of other services, whether it’s a
social worker or a clinic. If you want to access the site in Rhode Island you will have to go through
counseling and treatment – a whole package of supports. That kind of thing I could get behind.
NARCAN
CB2: Would it be helpful to have vending machines of Narcan? We understand there was a
program designed to provide Narcan through vending machines. There were supposed to be 10 of
those machines. Four were rolled out and have distributed 2,100 kits, but we understand the
program was shuttered by a lack of organizations willing to partner with them. Would it be helpful
for our board to advocate for these?
Brennan and Solomon: I don’t know that you need a vending machine, but what I would suggest
is just that you get to do naloxone training. If a group does naloxone training it will receive a
supply of Narcan, and carrying it can save a life. Naloxone – Narcan – is most effective when
applied by people who are trained to use it. Narcan has no negative effect on the body if it turns
out the person was not actually overdosing. The one effect it can have is to produce immediate
withdrawal symptoms in someone with a substantial habit. Training teaches how to handle that,
too.
CITY HOTSPOTS
Brennan and Solomon: The worst kind of drug markets are probably up in the Bronx. The 25th
precinct in Manhattan is pretty bad. There are areas in the 9th precinct that are bad, and we’ve had
violence associated with them. The highest rates of overdose deaths by far are in the Bronx. They
have about seven of the top 10 overdose districts.
But if you’re living in your neighborhood and you’re afraid to go out at night because someone
will be strung out on your stoop, it doesn’t make any difference if other areas have it worse than
you. It feels pretty bad.
CB2: Should we advocate for reduced scaffolding?
Brennan: Yes, drug dealers want to be hidden. So we want more openness, more light on the street.
CITIZEN ACTIVITY
CB2: What are things that community members can do? Should they bother reporting activity that
they see?
Brennan: I think that they should continue to report because that is what gets attention. You guys
are doing a good job of making noise, and I hear you. We’re trying to figure out, where are your
hotspots? That gets the wheels moving.
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND REDUCED DRUG ACTIVITY
68CB2: What can we do as a board? It seems that increasing policing and prosecution alone hasn’t
reduced drug sales and activity in our area.
Brennan and Solomon: We have worked in the Times Square area reducing the number of people
selling drugs, and we have seen a reduction of deaths in that area. We think there are four
recognized ways to reduce overdose deaths:
1) Supply control: law enforcement. Does it feel ineffective? Yes, but it’s about disrupting
sales. You disrupt, and disrupt, and disrupt, and if the seller thinks s/he’s actually going
to face a consequence – and by the 4th or 5th time they’re arrested for selling drugs there
will be actual consequences – you make a dent. You won’t declare victory, but – and we
did this in the crack epidemic – you take parts of the city back, row by row, block by
block. What you don’t want to do is normalize selling of drugs.
2) Harm reduction: Increase training and distribution of Narcan. Harm reduction centers.
3) Treatment: The number of people entering treatment is declining. People don’t respond to
just being offered the option of treatment. We have to think of ways to get people into
treatment. When somebody’s been charged with a narcotic crime and we believe their
crime is really motivated by their drug use, we will offer treatment as an alternative to
incarceration. There are people who’ve told us they would never have stayed with a
treatment program but for that incentive.
4) Prevention: Not a “scared straight” approach, but getting information to people so that
they know what is in the drug supply and the risks they’re running, especially children.
We are working with Department of Education now to do more outreach. My guess is
senior centers could use that information as well.
I believe that we have overemphasized Steps 1 and 2. I’d like to see us emphasize Steps 3 and
4.
A DIFFICULT PROBLEM:
CB2: The question of supply or demand being the problem is interesting. We see a high
demand for Safe Havens for homeless individuals, and those can connect folks to addiction
and mental health services.
Brennan: I speak at international conferences and what I hear over and over again is, what is it
with the US? Nobody has the kind of problem we have. Canada is the other country that comes
anywhere near us; Scotland is the next highest in terms of OD rate. I think we are victims of
an accident of geography, a rich country right next to a poor country, Mexico.
CB2: People in our community are frustrated. This topic is covered every month at the local
precinct meetings. A lot of people are not accepting treatment, and we have this little circle
that is growing.
Brennan: When we started offering treatment as opposed to incarceration, we had success with
that. A lot of people don’t like that model but we may have to do something like that because
people don’t respond to just the offer of treatment. And they are committing crimes. Not just
drug crimes, but a lot of other crimes associated with it. So that would be my number one
69message, is to think about how to get more people into treatment. And the second is getting
out the prevention message.
PARKS & WATERFRONT
Topic: discussion to create our committee’s submission to this year’s Community Board 2
District Needs Assessment
After introducing our two new, recently appointed committee members, Benjamin Listman and
Edward Siegel, our discussion began with an explanation of the District Needs Assessment
purpose, process, anticipated deliverables and timings. We then shared and reviewed our
committee’s list from last year and the pages of responses from all City agencies to last year’s
full CB2 submission. Then, we began the process of considering new P&W committee requests
along with those requests that had not been delivered over the year. Our committee decided to
include most of those still open requests on our submission for this year. Our list has two parts:
capital requests and expense requests. It was explained that all requests under $50K or with
expected lifetimes under 5 years are expenses. A capital asset is one that has both a useful life of
5 or more years and a purchase price in excess of $50,000.
We decided to cut change some of the requests we made in last year’s submission to “meeting
topics” at which we will work to devise more specific requests. Our resulting list, which we will
contribute to the full CB2 process, and which will be prioritized against other committee
contributions, is as follows:
- Our community requires a Recreation Center and an outdoor pool. The Tony Dapolito
Recreation Center has been closed for years and may not be salvageable or able to be
repaired or that so may prove not worth doing for the cost that will be required. The
outdoor pool that exists next to the building has been closed for several summers and will
remain closed for several more because the wall of the rec center building is unstable and
collapse of it could injure pool users. We are separating our discussion of the re-opening
of the Tony Dapolito Recreation Center into 2 requests and we (our committee and CB2)
want to be part of the process that the city will run to make these decisions:
o Rec Center: In July of this year, Community Board 2 passed a resolution asking
that the new proposed affordable housing building at 388 Hudson ""include a NYC
Parks recreation center of at least three floors at the base of the building
footprint"". Our capital request is to deliver on this request, if funding is required
from the city; it is thought that the chosen developers of the new building might
be provide the funding for the rec center themselves.
o Outdoor pool and mural: preserve and protect the existing Keith Haring mural and
preserve or replace the outdoor pool.
70- Allocate funds to repair the playground and the pathway between the field and the
playground and courts at James J Walker Park, recognizing that a “master plan” for the
full block may result from the process of reconsidering the space currently occupied by
the building that is the Tony Dapolito Center
- Allocate funds for the permanent preservation of the Elizabeth Street Garden, in its
entirety, on land owned by NYC Department of Citywide Administrative Services, on a
through lot on Elizabeth Street and Mott Streets, between Prince and Spring Streets.
Repairs or updates or process changes not requiring capital allocations, but possible expense
spending:
- Allocate funds to investigate opportunities to add more dog parks and dog runs, including
some with grass, in our community.
- Allow funds to determine where to locate a place for skateboarders to congregate and
skate, since they are not supposed to utilize open space, they are currently using such as
Washington Square Park and Mercer Playground.
- Allocate funds to add benches at the three “pocket parks” on Avenue of the Americas –
Minetta Playground / Golden Swan, Minetta Green and Minetta Triangle Park.
- Issues at LaGuardia Garden with “ponding” between and on the east side by Morton
Williams and sinking within the gardens continue to occur and cause risks, especially in
the winter when they can freeze and become dangerous to pedestrians. (realizing repairs
may require capital, not just expense)
- Despite efforts by the Department of Parks and Recreation to address the problem of rat
infestation, the CB2 office constantly receives complaints about rats in Washington
Square Park and the parks along Avenue of the Americas (Minetta Triangle, Minetta
Playground and Golden Swan). We are requesting additional resources targeting it and
note that special focus should be paid to rat burrows and tunneling in and around trees
because such damage to the root base is causing trees to lean and eventually damaged
trees have to be removed because of the hazard of them falling.
Future meeting topics, rather than need requests at this time:
- Review the purpose and the most effective use of the space at the Time Landscape,
including re-thinking the area completely.
71- Re-imagine the Playground of the Americas at Houston St. and Avenue of the Americas.
- Vesuvio Playground: after our request to clean up the drain at the southwest corner of the
space last year, the Parks Department responded by implementing a fix which helped
considerably; however, the drain has not been completely connected into the sewer,
which we are told would resolve the issue.
- Potential new or improved uses for Canal St. Park and Freeman Plaza, including as
skateboard or dog parks, though both uses have dedicated spaces in nearby Hudson River
Park.
- Consider new uses for Grand Canal Court space which will be returned to the community
in the coming year(s) after the subterranean work / project is completed. The pledge from
the city was to return it in its’ prior form, i.e., basketball courts, but there may be
opportunity to re-imagine it
- Review the latest thinking and plans for the space that is Duarte Square and the de-
mapped street recognizing that a large building is planned for the city-block sized section
to the west

PUBLIC SESSION
Darlene Lutz - Announcing the 1st Precinct's National Night Out. An event for the community
and the precinct to come together. The 1st Precinct’s event will be at South Street Seaport, Pier
16, in the evening of August 6th, from 6-8pm.
Alfred Fuente – against City of Yes for Housing Opportunity and 388 Hudson Street - City
of Yes is a gravy train for the real estate industry. Aiming for a 20% increase in affordable
housing in 2 years is insufficient. There are other options that the city should take. The City has
the power as well as the resources to address the City's affordable housing crisis.
Adam Zeldin – For City of Yes - Here to talk about City of Yes for Housing Opportunity. Had
the privilege of serving on CB2 for 5 years. When his fiancé moved into his apartment, they
needed to upgrade to a larger apartment. Due to the forces of market rent, he had to leave a
neighborhood that he loved. The dearth of affordable housing causes people to experience delays
in starting families, homelessness and other negatives. City of Yes is a reasonable and common-
sense proposal to add a bit more density, and a bit more housing, mostly in the outer Boroughs.
The league of conservation voters supports this as an environmentally sound way to grow
sustainably.
Tony DaPolito Center
• Angela Manno – Opposing the potential demolition of the Tony DaPolito Center. This is
a landmark, a place where people could swim and recreate affordably. Tired of seeing
public spaces being privatized, similar to the loss of [St.Vincent’s] hospital. This is not a
financially sound decision.
• Nora Killoran - Born and raised in this neighborhood and has used that recreation center
since 6 years old. Just a regular New Yorker who depends on the center. Physician
recommended swimming to recover from injuries; unable to do so due to the
inaccessibility of pools. Fed up with being squeezed out of these kinds of these spaces.
Wishes that there was greater accountability for this project.
• Dr Gil Horowitz - Has lived in NYC for 88 years, and in the neighborhood for 56 years.
Recognizes that the resolution at hand does not discuss the proposed demolition. Would
like to see the rec center come back to life again.
3• Sandra Cohn – Very frustrated following last week's Land Use / Parks meeting. Don't
understand why the building's age (100 years old) renders it destroyable.
• John Yohalem - Lived in the neighborhood for 47 years and has frequently used the
Tony DaPolito Rec Center. Modern towers are built too tall, there is more shadow across
the City. It is important to hold on to the things that belong to the City at large.
• Amy Wachtel - Stunned at the meeting last week when it was announced that the Center
would be replaced and not repaired. Struggles to understand how the City can't afford
repairs; questions whether private fundings sources can and might be considered. For
residents who have lived here for a long time, this space is a needed structure and is
affordable.
• Lucille DeVito - Three generations have used the center and its affordable gym facilities.
Daughter was on the swim team. Considering the landmark status of the recreation
center, hopes that important components can be preserved. What is going to be done with
the space? Demanding a public hearing.
• John Stuart - Appalled to learn that they are considering demolishing this space.
Renovations have been progressing, and the announcement of demolishment comes as a
surprise. What is going on behind closed doors?
• Rachel Gellman – The Keith Haring mural must be preserved. This situation is
reminiscent of Elizabeth Street Garden. Fears that NYC knows the price of everything
and the value of nothing.
• Linda Meyers - Was involved in establishment of a garden. Had suggested that the Tony
DaPolito space be a garden, and folks ran with it and made the rec center. Recommends
that a fountain be added to the space.
• Andrew Berman – It would be a tragic mistake to allow the demolition of the recreation
center. The building should not be demolished just because it is old. The intention to
demolish the building was clearly stated in the last meeting. Regarding 388 Hudson
Street, asks that HPD bring down the height of the building and that all available space be
used for housing, and that all affordable housing remain permanently affordable. The
bulk of the 388 Hudson building should be mitigated via setbacks from the façade.
• Anne Mitcheltree - Has worked in the mental health and recreation space. Refers to
events across her lifetime illustrating 43 years of service to the city.
• Susan Parker – It is important to preserve the center.
4• David Cohen - Supports the preservation of the Tony DaPolito Center. Is against the
City of Yes proposals. Knows that the August 3rd deadline for sidewalk cafes is
approaching. Hopes that the board is aware of the push for enforcement of the tear down
of outdoor dining structures.
• Robert Esnard - Graffiti on the Dapolito Center building on West Houston. The
resolution being considered this evening limits supported restoration activities to the first
floor. This should be updated to reference spaces where the graffiti is present.
• Cheryl Broth - Interested in the money that has been spent on the center so far.
Recommends the preservation of Tony's name on future projects. Expresses concern
about height regulations in the area. The abutting library is also worthy of preservation.
Regarding 503 Broadway
Michael Zoltan – (Attorney for the applicant) Application for a renewal of a special permit that
was issued in 2019. The special permit granted more space for Zara than zoning would otherwise
allow for this commercial use. Confirmation of the renewal of the special permit is required to
be memorialized on a certificate of occupancy. This is to renew the certificate of occupancy.
Concern about employees using outside space for breaks is valid and will be addressed.
• Question from Katy Bordonaro: Thank you for attending. The Committee has requested
that relevant documents be forwarded to the committee. Michael will send the materials
to the board immediately.
Pawel Tkaczuk - Accessibility of contact information. Zara has placed a reminder of the
dedicated phone number that can be used for the purpose of feedback on the space and better
serving guests and neighbors. As to the concern about the employees, speaker assures the
community that they have spoken to employees about this concern.
ADOPTION OF AGENDA
The agenda was adopted by acclamation.
ELECTED OFFICIALS’ AND REPRESENTATIVES’ REPORTS
There were no reports delivered by elected officials themselves. Electeds’ Staff reports are set
forth below.
5ADOPTION OF MINUTES
The minutes of the June 2024 Full Board were adopted by acclamation.
BUSINESS SESSION
Chair's Report: Susan Kent
Website Updates
• Chairs of committees with self-driven agendas must submit their Committee’s agenda in
time for the first e-blast of the calendar for the following month. For August 2024, the due
date is July 25th.
Full Board location
• Change of location for Full Board meeting due to A/C issues at God's Love We Deliver.
CB2 is grateful both to God’s Love We Deliver for welcoming us, and to St. Anthony of
Padua Church for a last-minute welcome when the alternate venue was unworkable in the
summer heat.
Staffing changes in NYS Senator Brian Kavanagh’s office
• Many thanks to Stacie Johnson, Community Liaison for State Senator Brian Kavanagh, for
her work, as she will be changing roles.
District Manager’s Report: Mark Diller
Local Concerns
• Residents continue to express concern about the impacts on Cornelia Street, Washington
Place, and Waverly Place due to increased 6th Precinct enforcement in Washington Square
Park, especially in the Northwest Corner of the Park. The Community is grateful for
increased enforcement especially relating to drug sales, and seeks assistance with displaced
populations as a result of the enforcement activities. Matter is a frequent topic of
conversation at Precinct Community Council meetings.
District Needs Statement
• The process of compiling the District Needs Statement and associated statement of Budget
Priorities is under way. Please respond to the survey found on our eblast and website
6calling for direct Community input on budget priorities. Board Members will have access
to a variety of materials to support their work on these Charter-Mandated tasks.
Fiscal Year 2024 Budget
• CB2 used essentially its entire budget for personnel, operations and equipment.
• Grateful to Council Member Marte who provided an additional $5,000 to supplement
CB2’s budget for fiscal year 2025. Given the need for independent consultants on issues
such as a Citywide Zoning Text amendment, the funds will be put to good use.
Additional Seach Feature in Development for the CB2 Website
• With the help of outside consultants, CB2 is working on a new way to search our database
of resolutions and other documents that will be more efficient and yield more useful search
results. The first phase is complete, and a labor-intensive next phase is in the planning
stages. That phase will require re-naming legacy documents in a format that makes
searches easier and more reliable. Mark will be reaching out to Committee Chairs to ensure
that the new naming conventions are being used correctly.
STANDING COMMITTEE REPORTS WITH RESOLUTIONS
LANDMARKS AND PUBLIC AESTHETICS
1.*122 Macdougal St. – Application is to install a stoop gate at the bottom of the building’s
entrance stairs.
The applicant did not appear as scheduled for the hearing and therefore there is no recommendation
concerning the application. The applicant must appear for a public hearing before the CB2
Landmarks Committee prior to the consideration of the application by the Landmarks
Commission.
Vote: Unanimous, with 39 Board members in favor.
2.*65-83 W. Houston St. – Application is to paint over graffiti on the building masonry façade,
in LPC approved colors, to match the existing polychromed CMU masonry façade.
Whereas:
A. This property is a chronic graffiti target and after decades of utilizing graffiti removing
chemicals on the ground floor, the applicant found that repeated applications of these chemicals
was scarring the building façade, so hired a consultant to offer a plan for future graffiti removal
7that would be both more immediately remedial and less harmful to the building façade over time;
and
B. The consultant presented a plan to strip the façade down to the original surface and to address
future graffiti by having building management allow retail tenants to paint over graffiti in acrylic
paint to match the original façade color, and to address the resulting inevitable paint build up by a
maintenance cycle of removal of the over-painting every few years; and
C. The paint colors presented were a convincing match for the original façade, the plan would
seem to significantly reduce the use of the more damaging stripping chemicals previously used,
and this plan allows for more timely graffiti removal; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends approval of the plan as presented, as long
as the plan is limited to the first floor.
Vote: Unanimous, with 39 Board members in favor.
3.*338 Bowery – Application is to replace the existing wood doors and frame with steel frame and
metal doors in kind and design to match existing, repaint window frames from white to black,
request the use of existing bracket for signage, plaque size on façade and blade sign on 2nd floor.
Whereas:
A. The subject property is a fairly intact example of the sort of establishment for which the Bowery
was once known, and provides an important architectural reference point in the context of the
historic district, and its renovation/ restoration provides a unique opportunity to understand a
distinctive aspect of the NoHo Historic District’s history; and
B. The first part of the application proposes to paint the second, third, and fourth story window
frames and fire escape doors the same black as the ground floor steel window frames, rather than
replicating the white color seen in the designation photo, which is more typical in creating a visual
demarcation of street level from upper stories; and
C. The wooden entry doors are proposed to be replaced by steel doors, with a pattern of square
divided lights that is awkward in both its interruption of the rhythm of the rectangular lights seen
in the ground floor windows, and in its relationship to the sills of the adjacent windows; and
D. The five shiny brass lighting fixtures seem nautical, and are non-contextual in both material
and design; and
E. The internally lit 75” high blade sign in neon green acrylic, seems particularly out of sync with
the district, misses an opportunity to take inspiration from the look of the original “White House
Rooms” sign that was once there, and lacks coherence with the proposed bronze plaque at the
entrance; and
8F. The cellar stair will have a new access gate and its reconfiguration requires the removal of 3
courses of brick beyond what was already approved by the Commission in order to comply with
Code; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:
A. Denial of the black paint on the window frames and fire escape doors on floors 2, 3, and 4, and
advocates for the top three floors to be painted in a soft white, as seen in the historic photos. We
further suggest that, should the fire escape doors ultimately need to be replaced that they be
replaced with partially glazed doors; and
B. Denial of the change of front door material from wood to steel, noting that the effect of the
proposed changes in material to the signage, lighting, and doors have the aggregate effect of
homogenizing the façade to a point where it loses its defining presence within the NoHo Historic
District; and
C. Denial of the five brass lighting fixtures due to their lack of meaningful reference within the
district; and
D. Denial of the blade sign due to its lack of meaningful reference within the district, and suggest
that the applicant look to the historic photos for signage inspiration; and
E. Approval of the bronze plaque at the entry; and
F. Approval of cellar gates and the removal of 3 additional courses of brick.
Vote: Unanimous, with 39 Board members in favor.
4.*51 Barrow St. – Application is to repair double-hung window, construct a 5’ horizontal
extension in the rear, construct a non-visible rooftop terrace, add non-visible mechanical
equipment, and partially excavate at the rear yard.
Whereas:
A. The scope of work for public review is limited to the rear façade, rear addition, leveling of roof
and rooftop mechanicals, and is largely invisible from a public thoroughfare; and
B. The existing rear addition no longer reflects the home’s Federal Style and presents serious
structural issues; and
C. There will be partial excavation in the rear yard that the applicant represented as having been
already approved at staff level; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:
9A. Approval of the window repair, the rear extension, the non-visible rooftop terrace and
mechanical equipment; and
B. That the applicant give evidence to the Commission that proper engineering studies have been
undertaken with respect to the excavation, and that required notification to owners of adjacent
properties has been given, and that a plan of demolition and construction that ensures the integrity
of the subject property and adjoining properties is being followed.
Vote: Unanimous, with 39 Board members in favor.
5.*44 Jane St. – Application is to reconstruct a 3-story high rear extension and create a new
rooftop addition to the house.
Whereas:
A. The two-family row house is being returned to its original one family plan and the rear
extension will be modified from its current odd configuration and will now fill the void at the
ground level; and
B. Although most of the elements of the Greek Revival/Italianate Style house are no longer
apparent in the rear façade and the applicant represented that there is no evidence of a tea porch,
there is an original wood cornice that will be restored, and the top floor contains characteristic 3
punched openings which are retained and in harmony within the row; and
C. The new addition in brick, stucco and cast brownstone, does not encroach into the rear yard
any further than the previous one and sits well with the row; and
D. The rooftop addition has taken some of its design inspiration from the many atelier/skylight
examples seen within the district; and
E. The position of the house makes the rear portion of the addition highly visible from a public
thoroughfare as seen in vantage point B in the application; and
F. In acknowledgement of its inevitable visibility, the architect stated that the addition was
designed for visibility and cited its atelier/ skylight typology; and
G. While the minimally visible front portion of the addition facing Jane Street does reflect this
typology, the maximally visible rear portion does not, and it appears completely contemporary and
entirely out of place; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:
A. Approval of the reconstructed rear yard extension; and
10B. Denial of the rooftop addition as currently designed, noting that the highly visible portion is
sorely out of place in the district, and asks that the applicant return to the Committee with a design
that is more truly evocative of the historical reference cited.
Vote: Unanimous, with 39 Board members in favor.
LAND USE
1. 503 Broadway – is an application to renew a previously granted special permit to legalize a
42,000sf retail establishment on the cellar, first and second floors of a condominium in the SoHo-
Cast Iron Historic District.
Whereas
1. 503 Broadway is requesting a 3-year renewal of their special permit pursuant to ZR 74-
922 which came before CB2 in 2019. This 74-922 action before the City Planning
Commission was in regard to Zara’s unpermitted Large Retail operation at 503
Broadway, which had been found to be operating contrary to its Certificate of Occupancy
by the NYC Department of Buildings and lacking the required Special Permit.
2. When the special permit application came before CB2 in 2019, the neighborhood had
specific quality of life complaints – specifically that the deliveries for Zara, the retail
store tenant, on Mercer Street were noisy and disturbing to residents and local businesses,
and that such use would draw considerable vehicular traffic through local streets. CB2
recommended denial of the special permit at that time.
3. In the following years, the deliveries were switched from Mercer Street to Broadway and
the quality-of-life complaints about deliveries ceased.
4. Currently, the employees of Zara take their breaks on Mercer Street. They eat and smoke
on the stairs of local residents and businesses causing quality of life issues for the
neighbors.
5. No one from Zara attended the July 2024 committee meeting.
6. The applicant’s attorneys did attend the July 2024 committee hearing but were unable to
address the quality-of-life complaints.
7. At our July meeting, the Land Use committee requested that a representative of Zara
attend the full board meeting on July 18 to explain how Zara intends to address the
persistent quality of life complaints.
Therefore be it resolved that
1. CB2, Man.’s position of 2019 on the illegality of the floor area of this over-sized retail
establishment has not changed.
2. CB2 is pleased that the delivery process has changed for the better.
113. CB2 urges the applicant to address the disruption of the neighbors on Mercer Street by
working with their employees to use their break room.
4. CB2 requests that Zara or their attorneys provide all the relevant paperwork to the Board
Office.
Vote: Unanimous, 40 Board Members in favor.
2. The City of Yes for Housing Opportunity (COYHO) is a complex citywide zoning reform
proposal from the Department of City Planning (DCP) covering many aspects of zoning with the
stated goal of building a little more housing in every neighborhood. This approach, while worthy
in its goal, fails to address in CB2M many of the failures and shortcomings of past rezonings as
they related to the production of housing. CB2M believes that any zoning reforms specifically
applicable within CB2M must: a) incentivize the production of housing over commercial and
office development and b) include within any new housing production a significantly stronger
mandate for required affordable housing.
Whereas:
1. CB2M has a history of strongly advocating for affordable housing (AH) in our district,
but we have consistently lost to private developers in negotiations for the inclusion of
voluntary new AH or inclusion of AH as of right in the Hudson Square district, as well as
losing a huge amount of rent regulated units across the district prior to passage of the
Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 through various decontrol
loopholes. CB2M also has faced a steady loss of housing units due to conversions of
multi-unit buildings to single-family homes.
2. While CB2M understands the need for more housing, we urge the proposal to be much
bolder to incentivize affordable housing as a mandatory part of the entire COYHO. This
could create a real incentive, where if developers of market rate housing want to move
forward, they will need to incorporate affordable housing in their projects.
3. CB2M acknowledges the great need for housing in general. The COYHO plan addresses
this city wide, but only in the area of market rate housing.
4. The only component of COYHO that touches on affordable housing relies on voluntary
programs, which CB2M has seen rarely generates the number of projected units and does
nothing to address the imbalance of commercial to residential in our district.
5. Key to our thinking on this issue is the 2013 Hudson Square rezoning, which was
projected to create 3,300+ units of housing and included what the City considered
generous incentives for building affordable housing. Since then, only nine new residential
properties have been or are currently in the process of being built, culminating in adding
12only 1,618 new residential units to the neighborhood, 18% of which are affordable.
Meanwhile, commercial projects such as the Google and Disney campuses have been
built on sites projected for housing development.
6. COYHO will impact each community, neighborhood and community board differently
across our diverse city of 8.33 million. CB2M believes that each of the communities
specifically impacted by the many components of COYHO should have a louder and
more decisive voice on those specific issues. Many of those proposals that do not directly
impact CB2, such as town center zoning, elimination of parking mandates, transit-
oriented development, district fixes and railroad right-of-way may include positive
elements within them, but CB2M believes that the voices of communities that are directly
impacted by those elements of COYHO should be considered first in determining how to
best incorporate those elements within their own communities and still achieve the
citywide goals of COYHO.
Whereas proposals for COYHO include:
1. Universal Affordability Preference and Updates to Mandatory Inclusionary
Housing. Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) is a program that replaces Voluntary
Inclusionary Housing (VIH). It is designed to give additional floor area, typically 20% or
more, in exchange for affordable housing with an average of 60% AMI. The updates to
Mandatory Inclusionary Housing (MIH) are zoning text changes that would allow for
Option 3 (“deep affordability”) to be selected on its own within Manhattan.
2. Convert Non-Residential Buildings to Housing. This proposal is designed to expand
adaptive reuse regulations, allowing them in more geographical areas and with a larger
subset of eligible buildings. The entire City would now be eligible, and buildings that
were built up to 1990 would be eligible (previously, buildings were eligible if they were
built in 1961 or before).
3. Accessory Dwelling Units. Accessory dwelling units (ADUs) are defined as a new type
of residence structure that is at most 800 square feet and can be situated in the rear yard
of a single- or two-family dwelling.
4. Campus Infill. This proposal changes how campuses can be developed, where a campus
is defined as a housing development such as NYCHA, but the definition also includes
other campus developments such as Washington Square Village in CB2M. These rules
change how new development can occur in these campuses, moving away from “height
factor zoning” which preserves the open space on these campuses and simplifies the
zoning rules, removing the requirement for “open space” entirely. These infills can also
be market-rate.
5. Small and Shared Housing. This proposal removes the “dwelling unit factor” in
Manhattan, which is a method of ensuring that buildings are not built solely with small
units. The reason for removing the dwelling unit factor is to allow for a greater variety of
13housing types, including single-room occupancy (SRO housing with shared kitchens and
common facilities, and micro apartments.
6. Landmark Transferable Development Rights. This proposal would allow as-of-right
transfers of development rights, commonly referred to as “air rights”, from individual
landmarks across a greater geographic area.
7. New zoning districts. This is a technical change that adds four new zoning districts in
the Zoning Resolution but does not add these to the zoning map.
Therefore be it resolved, Community Board 2 Manhattan is opposed to COYHO because it fails
to address two long standing issues which stunt the production of housing and affordable housing
across all income levels in CB2M, specifically the lack of incentivization of housing production
over commercial and office development and the lack of inclusion of required affordable housing
within new developments; and rejects COYHO unless these issues are addressed and the
following changes are made:
1. Update Mandatory Inclusionary Housing to reduce reliance on Universal
Affordability Preference.
CB2M is severely disappointed that COYHO places too much reliance on the UAP,
instead of making substantive improvements to the mandatory affordable housing
program. Notably, UAP is the only affordability component of COYHO. Overall, this
represents a missed opportunity to create more affordable housing, and CB2M supports
updating MIH through a text amendment that for each MIH option would: a) deepen AMI
averages; b) increase the percentage of affordable units per development; c) require a
greater percentage of deeply affordable units per development; and d) increase the
number of allowed income bands to ensure a range of lower incomes are evenly targeted.
UAP formalizes a policy that makes affordable housing optional and moves the City
away from a framework of mandatory affordable housing. CB2M has also seen that,
given a choice, developers have not chosen the voluntary program in the past, such as in
the 2013 Hudson Square rezoning (see above).
2. Convert Non-Residential Buildings to Housing.
CB2M supports conversion of vacant offices and other non-residential buildings to
housing but urges City Planning to further disincentivize developers to build offices
instead of housing in CB2M to more fully realize the goals of COYHO. Historically,
commercial buildings have typically been granted a larger FAR than a residential
building in CB2M, so in a conversion scenario it is likely that the building being
converted will have a larger FAR than if it had originally been built as a residential
building. This is effectively a “bonus” for the developer. In keeping with the mindset that
any bonus should be used for production of affordable housing, this proposal will be
14more effective and equitable in requiring that any difference between the total FAR of a
converted office building and the maximum allowable FAR of a residential building in
the same zoning be allocated towards affordable housing.
3. Legalize Accessory Dwelling Units in R1 through R5 districts.
CB2M contains a number of single- and two-family dwellings with rear yards, although
the requirement for direct access to a street does limit the number of eligible lots.
There may exist configurations, similar to how carriage houses were incorporated into
numerous Village townhouses, where an ADU may now be legalized within CB2M,
although DCP categorizes this as “low density” proposal. In light of that possibility, it
would be remiss to not include a provision for mandating affordable housing in these units.
4. Revise Campus Infill to Protect Affordable Housing Residents.
CB2M supports making it easier for campuses to add new buildings but insists that
Mitchell-Lama and other public housing site campuses allow for use of Quality Housing
regulations only through a new CPC special permit that requires 100 percent affordability
on public sites, requires that public housing and large scale development sites meet certain
findings related to impact on existing buildings and residences, and grants the City Council
the opportunity to hear and vote on each application. This will protect existing affordable
housing residents and preserve public review as these sites are expanded.
5. Eliminate Dwelling Unit Factor for Small and Shared Housing.
CB2M supports proposals that would bring a diversity of housing types to the district. The
proposal to re-introduce housing with shared kitchens or other common facilities would do
so by eliminating the dwelling unit factor, currently set at 680 square feet. However, there
is a concern that eliminating the dwelling unit factor would allow developers to produce
buildings of all-studio apartments, decreasing the diversity of apartment types. A better
solution may be to lower the dwelling unit factor, not eliminate it, thereby allowing single-
room occupancy style housing while also preventing all-studio developments. Reducing,
but not eliminating, the dwelling unit factor would still allow for micro apartments, which
have been very successful in other cities as an entry point for people having their own
dwelling.
6. Add Affordability Mandates when Expanding Radius of Transferable Development
Rights for Individual Landmarks.
15CB2M contains 70+ individual landmarks and is home to fourteen historic districts, so
this is of special concern to CB2.
Allowing individual landmarks to sell development rights across a wider transfer radius
and simplifying the procedure would create a useful market for Development Rights,
allowing owners of landmarked buildings to generate funds for upkeep and maintenance
of their historic buildings. The proposal also does not mandate the inclusion of affordable
housing, which CB2M feels is a missed opportunity.
Be it further resolved that:
7. CB2M opposes the use of CPC authorizations for new projects and zoning changes
instead of existing CPC or BSA special permits, which involve a public hearing to ensure
that the needs and voices of our community are heard and acted upon.
8. CB2M agrees that the Mandatory Inclusionary Housing program needs to be overhauled.
9. CB2M finds the move away from Quality Housing to be unfortunate. This move severely
reduces light and air requirements, and we recommend reconstituting the reliance on the
standards of Quality Housing.
Be it further resolved that CB2M supports:
10. The creation of new zoning districts of:
• R6D: a 3 FAR district (with 75-foot height limit)
• R11: a 12.5 FAR district (with 325-foot height limit, permits towers)
• R11A: a 12.5 FAR district (with 325-foot height limit)
• R12: a 15 FAR district (with 395-foot height limit, permits towers).
Be it further resolved that CB2M strongly supports measures that will increase both the
affordable and the market rate housing supply.

16PARKS AND WATERFRONT
A Resolution Supporting Inclusion of a Recreation Center Within the Proposed Mixed-Use
Affordable Housing building at 388 Hudson St.
Whereas:
1. On July 10, 2024 at 5:30pm, CB2 Manhattan’s (CB2M) Land Use & Housing and Parks
& Waterfront committees met jointly to hear a presentation by the NYC Department of
Parks & Recreation (DPR) and the NYC Department of Housing Preservation &
Development (HPD) on the future of recreation center space in our neighborhood, more
specifically at the new affordable housing building proposed to be built at 388 Hudson St.
on the north side of the NYC Dept of Environmental Protection (DEP) water tunnel site.
[The south side of this lot is planned to become public open space operated by the
Hudson Square Business Improvement District and administered by the DPR in
coordination with DEP, which has placed constraints on the site to protect access to water
tunnel infrastructure below.]
2. In repeated resolutions over the past two years, CB2M has expressed the need for a
public recreation center in the neighborhood while the Tony Dapolito Recreation Center
has been closed for repairs. The area around the center is now a construction site that is
challenging to maintain.
3. In addition, CB2M has stressed its interest in locating a new public recreation center on
multiple floors at 388 Hudson St. regardless of what might occur in terms of renovation,
repairs and re-opening of the Tony Dapolito Recreation Center.
4. CB2M has also repeatedly stressed the importance of HPD, DEP and DPR working
together to maximize the potential of the residential and open space sites at 388 Hudson
St. A ten-foot no-drill zone on the southern flank of the north parcel raises questions of
how best to use that space.
5. Tyler Tichenor, HPD planner, reaffirmed that the residential building will be built on the
13,625sf site on the north side of the 388 Hudson lot. He explained that cooperation
between DPR, HPD, DEP and the DOE (because of the school that abuts the lot) has
resulted in a revision that will permit the site to be utilized with narrower setbacks,
increasing the floor plate on lower floors. Below-grade construction is now also seen as
possible.
6. DPR and HPD are now proposing that the ground floor plus two floors below grade be
used to create a recreation center to include, at a minimum, an indoor pool, basketball
courts, fitness and community rooms, a dedicated entrance, etc. An outdoor pool cannot
be included in the scope of this project.
7. Representatives stated that the almost 13,625sf size of the base and use of basements and
lower floors constitute effective use of square footage that doesn’t lend itself to
residential use. The current Tony Dapolito Recreation Center is 27,000sf. [As a point of
reference, The Chelsea Recreation Center is 56,000sf.]
178. A topic of discussion that was not explored was the ownership structure of a DPR public
facility sited within a privately-developed residential building on public land.
9. Though details of future plans for the building at 1 Clarkson Street/ 2-8 Seventh Avenue
South have not been determined, DPR also said that it was prioritizing preservation of the
Keith Haring mural and the outdoor pool and was exploring suggestions for future uses of
the space and that it would be soliciting further input from the community.
10. The Tony Dapolito Recreation Center is not an individual landmark but is within the
Greenwich Village Historic District Extension II (although the pool, playground,
landscaped areas and ballfields behind it are not1) and thus protected under the
Landmarks Law.
Therefore, be it resolved that CB2:
1. Thanks DPR, HPD and DEP for responding to CB2M’s request for a modern, full-
service, multi-story public Recreation Center at 388 Hudson St. with the potential for
regulation-sized facilities that have been unavailable at the Tony Dapolito Recreation
Center.
2. Asks that this information be incorporated as a prerequisite into the soon be produced and
released HPD Request for Proposals for 388 Hudson St.
3. Insists that DPR consider leasing appropriate space, perhaps a local unused gym on
Varick a block away, as an interim Recreation Center while the new building is not yet
built.
4. Applauds the agencies for working together as requested by the community board.
5. Recommends that DPR create protocols for public safety at and maintenance of the Tony
Dapolito Recreation Center site while it is closed.
6. Prioritizes the preservation of the Haring mural and an outdoor pool.
7. Requests further clarification regarding ownership, investment funding, perpetual public
access and maintenance expense protocols when the new DPR recreation center is
constructed in the building at 388 Hudson St.
8. Holds DPR to its promise that further community input will be solicited before any
decisions are made regarding the disposition of the current Tony Dapolito Recreation
Center.
Vote: Passed, with 33 Board members in favor, 4 against (A. Brenna, V. De La Rosa, M.
Fitzgerald, P. Laraia), and 2 abstentions (C. Booth, D. Raftery).

202. Ruby’s West Village LLC dba Little Ruby’s Cafe 225 West 4th St 10014 (OP–Restaurant,
Lic. ID# 0340-23-138523, SN# 1345228) (Alteration: Dining Out NYC-unenclosed sidewalk
café)
i. Whereas, the Applicant and Applicant’s Representative appeared before Community Board
2, Manhattan’s SLA Licensing Committee #1 & #2 to present an application for an alteration
to their On-Premises Restaurant Liquor License to add sidewalk seating on both West 4th
Street and 7th Avenue South to their ground floor licensed premises located within a four-
story mixed use townhouse building (ca. 1910) with a single story extension on a triangular
corner of Seventh Avenue and West 4th Street in Greenwich Village, this building falling
within NYC LPC’s designated Greenwich Village Historic District; and
ii. Whereas, the Applicant originally appeared before CB2, Man. in November/2021 for their
On-Premises Restaurant liquor license at which time Community Board 2, Man. unanimously
recommended denial of the application due to the Applicant’s negative history and past
conduct at their other establishments in CB2, Man.; at its March 22, 2023 full board hearing
the NYSLA also denied the application due to the substantial negative history of one of the
principals (Nicholas Mathers), the Applicant removed that principal from the license
(although he retained financial involvement through a loan to the remaining principals) and
was granted reconsideration of the application at the July 12, 2023 NYSLA full board hearing
at which time the NYSLA approved the On-Premise Restaurant liquor license despite CB2’s
objection that the issue was not just with the one principal but also with the remaining
principal who was the manager at the other problematic establishments; the approval from the
NYSLA having conditions including closing hours of 12 AM Sundays through Thursdays,
2 AM Fridays and Saturdays, background music only, that there would be no outdoor seating
until the Applicant proved that they “were earnest and trying to get along” and that the fence
on West 4th Street would come down; and
iii. Whereas, the ground floor storefront premises, which operated for years as The Riviera Café,
is roughly 4,835 sq. ft. (2,460 sq. ft. ground floor and 1,325 sq. ft. basement with the basement
not being presented for patron service), the ground floor space being located in multiple
buildings (225 and 229 West 4th St.) combined, with 35 tables and 70 patron seats, one (1)
stand-up bar with 10 seats, in addition to 10 tables and 20 seats in the enclosed sidewalk café,
the enclosed sidewalk cafe not physically separated from the interior premises, for a total
interior patron seating occupancy of 100 seats, there is currently a single patron entrance in
the “apex,” the southern, triangle part of the premises starting just north of the intersection of
7th Avenue and West 4th Street and running north on both sides until meeting the building
entrance, the area being enclosed by a metal fence attached to the sidewalk, that fence having
been installed by the owners of The Riviera Café (who also own the building) years ago, there
is also an entrance on 7th Avenue South into the enclosed café which the initial application
showed would be the single entrance, that entrance not currently in use; a Certificate of
Occupancy presented which permits eating and drinking on the first floor at 225 West 4th
21Street and at 229 West 4th Street; and
iv. Whereas, the Applicant first appeared before CB2, Man.’s SLA2 Licensing Committee in
June/2024 to present the instant alteration application at which time a number of concerns
were raised and the Applicant requested to lay over the application to July/2024; nearby
residents and the West Village Residents Association spoke against the application stating
that the Applicant was continuing their past transgressions of not following agreements,
photos were provided of patrons both sitting and drinking outside despite the fact that the
NYSLA granted the license with the condition that there would be NO outdoor, there currently
being bench seating in the enclosed “apex” area and a tall bench with chairs within the
property line outside the interior restaurant by 10th Street and 7th Avenue South contrary to
those specific and clear conditions imposed by the NYSLA; and
v. Whereas, questions were raised about the metal fence along both West 4th Street and 7th
Avenue South, the fence being shortened but not removed from West 4th Street as requested
by the NYSLA, the proposed sidewalk café area consisting of 4 tables and 8 seats on West 4th
Street being within the enclosed fence, the fence being 6'1"" from the curb yet West 4th Street
is a Neighborhood Corridor which requires an 8' clear path in the DOT Dining Out NYC
program and therefore the proposed seating does not follow the rules of the Dining Out NYC
program; additional questions were raised about the initial illegal installation of the permanent
fence, there being a stamped architectural drawing from 1993 made by an engineer (Nishan
Balikjian) to accompany an application dated 2/8/93 for Zonor Restaurant Corp to NYC DOT
showing a removable fence and removable red tiles, the installed fence instead being
permanently affixed to the public sidewalk, the DCA/DCWP sidewalk café program at the
time also requiring an 8' clear path, yet the drawing shows a 6' clear path with 4'11"" being
inside the fenced area, the sidewalk being 10'11"" in width according to the engineer’s drawing;
and
vi. Whereas, the Applicant returned this month without providing any new materials prior to or
at the meeting but stating that they were removing the permanent fence on West 4th Street and
replacing it with a removeable fence, that they would adjust the proposed seating on West 4th
Street by moving the fence and seating east 2' to leave the required 8' clearance while
maintaining the 4 tables and 8 seats on West 4th Street in addition to 4 tables and 8 seats on
the 7th Avenue South side of the “apex,” the bench, planters and fence on West 4th Street are
currently in place and unchanged from their original location, there being no diagrams
provided that document the changes being proposed, there are an additional 10 tables and 20
seats on the northern end of the 7th Avenue South side of the restaurant, in addition the
Applicant is adding the counter and two seats within the property line that remain outside, the
proposed exterior sidewalk seating being 18 tables with 36 seats and one counter with two
seats for a total outdoor seating of 38 seats, all outdoor seating, doors and windows will close
by 10 PM nightly; and
22vii. Whereas, a week following the SLA Licensing Committee meeting the Applicant provided a
detailed diagram with measurements showing the removal of the fence around the “apex”
with planters defining the sidewalk café area, the number of tables and chairs remaining the
same with the West 4th Street seating being moved to the east to allow for the Dining Out
NYC required 8' sidewalk clear path on West 4th Street, all other seating remaining the same
and conforming to the Dining Out NYC guidelines; and
viii. Whereas, there will be no changes to the method of operation of the restaurant, the restaurant

3. Lume West Village LLC dba Lume West Village 259 West 4th St 10014 (OP–Restaurant)
i. Whereas, the Applicants appeared before Community Board 2, Manhattan’s SLA Committee
#1 & #2 to present an application to the NYS Liquor Authority for an On-Premises Restaurant
Liquor License to operate an Italian bakery and café during the day transitioning to a full-
service restaurant in the evenings on the ground floor of a six (6)-story mixed-use building (c.
1905) on the residentially-zoned block of West 4th Street between Charles and Perry Streets
(Block #612/Lot #7503), the storefront being on the south side of the building; the building
falling withing NYC LPC’s designated Greenwich Village Historic District; and
24ii. Whereas, the premises proposed to be licensed is approximately 2,700 sq. ft. (1,600 sq. ft on
the ground floor and 1,140 sq. ft. in the basement, the basement being accessed by an exterior
sidewalk hatch with no patron use of the basement, the basement being for storage purposes
only), there will be 27 tables with 54 seats and one (1) bar with eight (8) seats for a total patron
occupancy of not more than 62 persons; there are three (3) entrances which will be used for
patron ingress and egress two (2) bathrooms; and

scheduled performances, no cover fees, velvet ropes, security personal or doormen, there is
no sidewalk or roadbed seating; the store front infill being fixed with no operable doors or

iv. Whereas, the location was most recently operated as Let’s Eat LLC dba Extra Virgin (Lic.
ID #0340-22-106993, SN #1149114, exp. 6/30/2024) since approximately 2004, with a
similar method of operation; and
v. Whereas, the instant application initially included sidewalk seating on a previously-installed
raised platform on the West 4th Street sidewalk described as being within the property line,
that seating being utilized by the prior licensee when the DCWP/DCA sidewalk café program
did not permit sidewalk seating within residentially-zoned neighborhoods unless it was within
the property line, it being unclear for years how the prior seating was permitted as the seating
did not fall within the property line; after meeting with the local block association and nearby
residents the Applicant removed the sidewalk seating from the instant application and instead
increased the interior seating from 47 seats to 62 seats to compensate for the loss of the
exterior seating, there being significant documentation (the Borough President’s map for the
location, the offering plan for the condo-cop of 259 West 4th Street which indicates the lot
line is the façade of the building, the deed to the property, the NYC Dept. of Finance tax lot
information which indicates that the lot and building size are the same) that the previously
installed platform is not within the property line and should not have been installed or utilized;
and
vi. Whereas, local residents wrote letters and appeared to voice their concerns about any seating
on the exterior of the premises, this being a residential block with a narrow sidewalk and
street, the residents having experienced the very negative quality of life impacts of sidewalk
seating from the previous occupant and being strongly opposed to any outdoor seating at this
location, the Applicant hearing those concerns and removing the sidewalk seating at this time,
concerns were raised that the Applicant was unwilling to agree to not having any sidewalk
seating in the future, the sidewalk being only 11' wide, the premises being located in a
Neighborhood Corridor which requires an 8' clear path under the DOT Dining Out NYC
program, additionally there are two tree pits in the sidewalk across from the restaurant, the
25residents otherwise being in support of the application and agreeing to the increase in interior
seats to compensate for the loss of exterior seating and thankful for the Applicant’s
willingness to work with them; and
vii. Whereas, the Applicant has executed and has had notarized a Stipulations Agreement with
Community Board 2, Manhattan which will be incorporated into the “Method of Operation”
of the On-Premises Liquor License, with those stipulations as follows:

use of the Crosby Street entryway and dedicated areas for the service of alcohol among other

Community Board 2, Manhattan which will be incorporated into the “Method of Operation”

D Distiller Liquor License (ID # 0056-19-100569, SN # 1304034, exp. 5/31/25) at the
location of the instant application; and
ii. Whereas, the Applicant and their representative appeared before Community Board 2,
Manhattan’s SLA #1 Licensing Committee in March/2024 to present an application to the
NYS Liquor Authority for a new Restaurant On-Premises Liquor License to operate a full-
service ground floor restaurant and bar with ancillary 2nd floor tasting room, 3rd floor lounge
and basement speakeasy spaces located across 4 floors, the kitchen being located in the sub-
cellar, in conjunction with the already-licensed craft distillery (since 2020) for the
manufacturing of spirits and a small retail store, the premises occupying an entire three story
commercial building (ca. 1951) which had previously never been licensed for the service of
alcohol and had operated as a discount apparel/shoe store and before that as an Office Depot
store, the building being located on Broadway between East 4th and Great Jones Streets
(Block #531/Lot #3) and falling within NYC LPC’s designated NoHo Historic District and
the designated Special SoHo-NoHo Mixed Use District; and
iii. Whereas, there are two entrances (2) to the building on Broadway and the Broadway
entrances will be the only two entrances used by patrons for ingress and egress, there also
being an emergency exit on Great Jones Alley in the rear of the building and a second rear
entrance leading to Great Jones Alley that will be used for deliveries and trash removal only;
and
iv. Whereas, the entire interior building is approximately 15,660 sq. ft., the first floor
restaurant and bar taking up 1,775 sq. ft. with approximately 24 tables and 54 table seats, 1
bar with 5 seats, 1 chef’s counter with 6 seats for a total seated occupancy of 66 seats and a

sidewalk in front or elsewhere, and the hours of operation will be from 11:30 AM to 2:00
AM every day/night of the week with all patrons being cleared from the premises at 2:00
AM every night; and
vii. Whereas, the Applicant originally appeared before CB2, Man. in January/2018 for an On-
Premises Liquor License for a restaurant, bar/lounge and distillery at which time the full
board of CB2, Man. recommended denial of the application due to a significant amount of
community opposition which is outlined in the January/2018 resolution, despite the
Applicant being willing to agree to a number of stipulations, those stipulations were not
sufficient to sway a large portion of local residents or members of CB2, Man., the Applicant
moving forward with the Distillery Liquor License but not pursuing the On-Premises Liquor
License at that time; and
viii. Whereas, the holder of a NYS Farm Distiller (Class D) license “may produce liquor, has a
75,000 gallon limit on annual production, and requires 75% New York State ingredients in
its products. A farm distiller may sell its liquor and any other New York State labeled
products (beer, cider, wine, mead, liquor) at the licensed premises and to go.” The Applicant
stating they want the On-Premises Liquor License in order to enhance the beverage menu
offerings by having the ability to sell liquor not made in New York State but that otherwise
the method of operation would stay essentially the same; and
ix. Whereas, included in the March/2018 stipulations that the Applicant was willing to agree
to at the time, but were not enough to appease the community or a number of community
board members, were closing hours of 12 AM with the restaurant open until 11 PM nightly,
background recorded music/no live music outside of private events, patrons being restricted
from taking drinks from each distinct eating/drinking area to another, no cover/entrance
fees, a limit of 12 full buy-outs per year for private or special events at which time there
may be DJs, no transfer of the license to an unaffiliated party (ie the On-premises license
will be surrendered upon leaving the premises); and
x. Whereas, in its capacity as a distillery, the Applicant has been operating since 2020 with a
full-service restaurant and bar on the ground floor, a tasting room bar open to the public on
31the 2nd floor, a VIP lounge/private, special event space on the 3rd floor and a stand-alone bar
in the cellar level used for tours and private events with tours of the distillery offered to the
public daily until approximately 8:30 PM, the distillery closing by 12 AM nightly (in 2018
the Applicant produced a “Letter of Intent” with the two adjacent buildings – 684 and 688
Broadway – limiting the operations of the Great Jones Distillery and hours of the restaurant
and ancillary bars/lounge to reduce noise, maintain crowd control on Broadway in front of
the premises and to curb excessive or disruptive uses of the Great Jones Alleyway during
its proposed operations) though there is no limitation on their hours of operation under the
farm distillery license; and
xi. Whereas, the instant application differs in significant ways not only from the current
method of operation but from what was agreed to, yet ultimately denied, in 2018; despite
the Applicant presenting the method of operation as staying essentially the same as their
current operations, they are asking to: extend the closing hour to 2 AM nightly and close
the full-service kitchen an hour earlier at 10 PM nightly, switching kitchen service to lighter
bar fare and thereby creating a late night 3 hour bar scene daily; add acoustic, non-amplified
music to the daily operations with no restriction on location; have the ability for patrons to
carry their drinks between floors and distinct eating/drinking areas; have up to 52 private
events (a private event is defined as closing two or more spaces from public access for one
event) per year potentially meaning that every Friday or Saturday night upwards of 200
persons would be leaving a private party with DJs and entertainment level music at 2 AM;
also, with the addition of the On-Premises Liquor License, their service of alcohol will no
longer be limited to that of New York State producers permitting them to serve any brand
of alcohol including the full range of Proximo Spirits brands of alcohol; and
xii. Whereas, the building is located within an M1-5B zoning district which allows certain
residential use as of right and is located directly across the street from a C6-2 Zoning
District; the abutting building to the North being residential on the upper floors, the abutting
building to the South is residential on the upper floors, the building to the rear is residential
on the upper floors and the building across the street is residential on the upper floors; and
xiii. Whereas, as they had in 2018, the Applicant submitted an amended “Letter of Intent” with
the two adjacent buildings (684 and 688 Broadway) limiting the operations of the Great
Jones Distillery and hours of the restaurant and ancillary bars/lounge to 2 AM nightly
provided there are not complaints from neighbors, stating that they had the support of the
two closest residential buildings, yet no one from those buildings appeared to speak either
in support or opposition to the application, residents of those buildings had appeared in 2018
in opposition to the On-Premises application with closing hours of 12 AM stating they were
unaware of the agreement; and
32xiv. Whereas, a representative of nearby stakeholders representing 6 buildings and 110
stakeholders appeared and submitted written testimony in opposition to the instant
application, stating that there had been no outreach to them, they had opposed the On-
Premises application in 2018 with earlier closing hours and are opposed to the licensing of
a venue of this size with late night hours and a significant number of special events, most
of these stakeholders having been members of the NoHo Bowery Stakeholders who shared
their concerns and opposed the application in 2018, and continue to have the same concerns
with the large number of special events, simultaneous small scale events in multiple spaces
and similar style events and ongoing tours, which would have an impact on the quality of
life in the immediate area; and
xv. Whereas, there was additional written opposition from the owner of Kings County
Distillery in Brooklyn concerned that the granting of an On-Premises Liquor License to
Great Jones Distillery being owned by Proximo, a spirits giant that is best known for the
brand Jose Cuervo, as well as other spirits such as Stranahan’s, Bushmills, and Proper
Twelve Irish Whiskey will create a corporate hub for these other spirit brands which is
certainly not in the spirit of the New York distillery laws, as enacted in 2003 and 2009, that
there are suitable spirits made in NY that meet every cocktail need as seen in the creativity
from other farm distillery tasting rooms and sharing concerns that the granting of the On-
Premises Liquor License sets a “dangerous precedent for any spirits behemoth to put up a
token still and use it as a trojan horse to create a direct channel to sell marked down
commodity spirts to a naïve audience;” and
xvi. Whereas, at the March/2024 SLA committee meeting in an effort to see if there were
parameters that could worked out to minimize the quality of life impacts, the Applicant was
asked if the 2 AM closing could be confined to a single room or rooms to ameliorate
concerns over the large size of the venue, the Applicant stating they needed the 2 AM for
various events and couldn’t be confined to any specific area, that they needed the flexibility
to hold a large number of events until 2 AM, that they had not had complaints in the 3 years
they have been in operation, it being pointed out that they closed at midnight, generally the
time of other restaurants in the area, and that the quality of life impacts happen in the later
hours; and
xvii. Whereas, at the March/2024 SLA Committee meeting, the Applicant requested to lay the
application over to April/2024 in order to do outreach to the neighbors and to determine if
a list of stipulations could be agreed upon; to that end the SLA Committee provided a list
of stipulations to the Applicant based off of the agreed upon stipulations in 2018 and what
was heard both from the public and the Applicant at the March/2024 meeting for them to
use as discussion points, the Applicant requesting to negotiate the stipulations outside of the
SLA Committee meeting, being told instead to reflect on what was heard and discussed at
the meeting, to do outreach to the neighbors and return to review the stipulations at the
April/2024 SLA Committee meeting; and
33xviii. Whereas, the Applicant returned to CB2 Man.’s SLA Licensing Committee in April/2024
to further present their application for a Restaurant On-Premises Liquor License, the only
significant change in the application from March/2024 was a reduction in hours from
Sunday to Tuesdays to close at 12 AM nightly, the hours would remain from 11 AM to
2 AM Wednesdays through Saturdays, any private events would close at 2 AM regardless
of the day of the week, the full kitchen would close at 10 PM nightly, it remained necessary
for patrons to carry their drink from one designated area to another, including outside of
private events, stating that patrons waiting for a table in the restaurant might be having a
drink in one of the other areas, all of which are located on other floors, and need to carry
the drink to the table once it’s available, concerns remaining that this will lead primarily to
a large bar scene not only during private events but in the requested later evening hours, no
one appeared to speak or submit written testimony in favor of the application, the Applicant
again saying the Letter of Intent shows support from the two adjacent residential buildings
yet there are no letters from specific residents of those buildings, the neighborhood group
representing 6 buildings and 110 stakeholders again spoke and submitted testimony in
opposition to the application citing the same quality of life concerns over the size of the
venue and the late night hours; and
ixx. Whereas, after hearing testimony of the community and the needs of the Applicant, the
Committee presented the Applicant with stipulations which included hours of 11 AM to
12 AM, 7 days a week (the hours agreed to by the Applicant in 2018) with 52 private events*
per year (*a private event being defined as closing two or more spaces from public access
for one event), 12 of which can extend closing hours to 2 AM regardless of the day of the
week with the possibility of a DJ and/or live amplified music during private events, the
Applicant being willing to agree to all of stipulations aside from closing hours of 12 AM
daily, instead insisting they need to close at 2 AM Thursdays through Saturdays; and
xx. Whereas, this application being subject to the 500 foot rule, requiring the applicant to
demonstrate whether the public interest of the community would be served by the granting
of the license, there being 34 licensed premises within 750 ft. of the premises according to
LAMP, there being quality of life concerns due to the size and late hours of the proposed
operation, there being nothing unique added with the granting of this license as there are
already numerous bars and restaurants in the immediate vicinity, the uniqueness of the
premises being that of a distillery, the distillery itself taking up a small portion of the
premises, that uniqueness being minimized by the addition of the On-Premises license, the
Applicant currently able to operate with unlimited hours and number of private events under
the existing Class D Distiller Liquor License only limited by their agreement with Board of
Managers of 1 Great Jones Alley Condominium (as successor to Downtown RE Holdings
LLC) and 684 Owners Corp., the Letter of Intent dated October 25, 2023 limiting the hours
to 2 AM; and

Distillers, LLC dba Great Jones Distillers, 686 Broadway basement, 1st, 2nd & 3rd Floors, 10012
on its application seeking a new Restaurant On-Premises Liquor License; and
THEREFORE BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that if this application is filed by the applicant
and is considered by the New York State Liquor Authority, CB2, Man. requests that this
recommendation to deny the application is fully considered and thoroughly reviewed at the 500-
ft. hearing and request that appropriate consideration be weighed that the licenses previously
issued to the applicant for Class D-1 Farm Distiller licenses (for which no demonstration of public
interest, convenience and advantage is required and which allows for the service of alcohol
produced on site, from other NYS producers and other allowable uses) be considered as adequate
for the premises, despite the applicant proposing that only 50% of the distilling process will occur
at this premise; and
THEREFORE BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that should this application be considered by
the Liquor Authority after a 500-ft. hearing is conducted, CB2, Man. respectfully requests that this

TRAFFIC AND TRANSPORTATION
1. Resolution in Response to presentation by NYC Dept. of Transportation (DOT) proposing
Protected Bike Lane Upgrades on 6th Avenue from Lispenard St. to West 14th St.
Whereas the NYC Dept. of Transportation (DOT) presented a proposal for extending the 6th Ave.
bike lane south from W. 8th St. to Lispenard St. and adding upgrades along that corridor and up to
W. 14th St. to improve safety and accessibility for pedestrians, cyclists and public bus (M55 and
M21) users; and
55Whereas DOT's proposed design includes:
Lispenard St. to W. Houston St.
• 8 ft. protected bike lane on e. side of 6th Ave. (e. side location avoids conflicts with and
congested intersections from left-turning tunnel-bound traffic on w. side). 3 ft. buffer, 9
ft. parking lane/painted pedestrian space, three travel lanes (11 ft, 10 ft, 11 ft.), with 8 ft.
parking lane on w. side.
• Bus boarding islands on e. side of 6th Ave. to reduce conflict btw. buses and bikes and
improve MTA bus accessibility. Boarding island placements are being studied at existing
bus stops at W. Broadway, Thompson, Broome, Prince and Spring Sts.
• Pedestrianization of Sullivan St. slip lane at Watts St. with northbound access retained
from Broome St.
W. Houston St. to W. 8th St.
• 8 ft. protected bike lane on w. side of 6th Ave., 3 ft. buffer, 9 ft. parking lane/painted
pedestrian space, three travel lanes (10 ft., 11 ft., 11 ft.), with 8 ft. parking lane on e. side.
• Bus stops remain in place on e. side of 6th.
W. 8th St. to W. 14th St.
• Widened (10 ft.) protected bike lane (allowing cyclists passing - 5 ft. + 5 ft.) on w. side of
6th Ave., 3 ft. buffer, 9 ft. parking lane/pedestrian island, three travel lanes (11 ft., 11 ft.,
11 ft.), with 11ft. parking lane on e. side.
• Existing concrete islands preserved in place.
• Travel lanes continuing configuration from below 8th St.
Whereas Community Board No. 2 Manhattan (CB2) has been requesting that the 6th Ave.
protected bike lane be extended from its W. 8th to W. 14th St. CB2 location south to Canal St. in
several resolutions since 2016, and DOT is proposing an extension to Lispenard St., actually one
block south of Canal, providing a continuous and very welcome protected bike lane connection
and safe passage all the way from Church St. and 6th Ave. btw. Barclay and Lispenard Sts. to 59th
St. where, except for the stretch btw. Lispenard and W. 8th St., protected bike lanes have
previously been installed; and
Whereas in its resolution of January 22, 2016, CB2 requested that the travel lanes on 6th Ave.
btw. Canal and W. 14th Sts. be reduced from four to three in the interest of shorter, safer street
crossings for pedestrians and more room for bicycle safety plus amenities, citing similar lane
reductions on 8th and 9th Aves. that DOT studies showed didn't cause additional congestion; and
56Whereas currently, DOT has run traffic models that show that a preponderance of the traffic on
6th Ave. heads west to the Holland Tunnel, allowing sufficient space to accommodate the
remaining moving vehicles in three lanes; and
Whereas although there are concrete pedestrian refuge islands at intersections on the W. 8th to
W. 14th St. portion of 6th Ave. (with the existing bike lane) providing shorter crossings and safe
havens for pedestrians traversing the street, the DOT's plans for such intersection crossings on the
Lispenard to W. 8th St. proposed bike lane portion allow only for markings, paint and vertical
plastic bollards. However, DOT has indicated that if CB2 feels strongly that concrete refuge
islands are needed at specific locations, DOT encourages CB2 to share information with them
about these locations and needs, and DOT will take another look and see what can be done, keeping
in mind the limited amount of concrete DOT has available; and
Whereas bicycle volumes on 6th Ave. have grown heavily (2,000 bikes in a recent12 hour count)
and continue to grow, accompanied by greater e-bike use with larger speed differences and more
passing in the bike lane as well as wider cargo bikes that leave less room for passing, necessitating
added bike lane width; and
Whereas the bike lane crossover from the east to the west side of 6th Ave. is planned to occur at
Houston St., aided by signalization and markings such as green dashes across the intersection
directing cyclists where to go. Advance notice to be prepared for the switch is imperative; and
Whereas there are continuous problems with traffic conflicts, congestion and gridlock as vehicles
advance to enter the Holland Tunnel from 6th Ave. that call for continuous oversight and
enforcement by the NYPD which has been diminished and needs to be increased; and
Whereas attention needs to be paid to ensure an orderly progression of traffic on 6th Ave. that is
headed to the Holland Tunnel and to organize and separate those vehicles that are proceeding to
the Tunnel from the through traffic, i.e., vehicles that are continuing to go on straight ahead; and
Whereas it was observed that there is a significant amount of loading and unloading activity on
6th Ave. in the Canal to 14th St. bike lane area that needs to be accommodated to avoid double-
parking and other vehicular conflicts; and
Whereas there were concerns that extensive subway construction and infrastructure projects
taking place on both sides of 6th Ave. from Canal St. up and beyond Grand St. would conflict with
the anticipated bike lane installation, and DOT assured that they've done a site visit with DOT
engineers and have been conferring with MTA, and that they are prepared to work around the
obstacles as needed.
Therefore be it resolved that CB2 thanks DOT for responding to the need to fill the gap of a
missing protected bike lane on 6th Ave. btw. W. 8th and Canal Sts., as expressed by CB2's many
resolutions since 2016, and extending the lane further south to Lispenard St., providing for a
continuing safe route for cyclists from the Financial District to Central Park; and
57Be it further resolved that CB2 is in favor of reducing the four travel lanes on 6th Ave, where
motor vehicles often move at high speed, to three travel lanes; and
Be it further resolved that CB2 asks DOT to install concrete pedestrian refuge islands as initial
elements in the protected bike lane upgrades on 6th Ave. at the following hazardous locations:
• SW corner of Greenwich Ave., considered to be an exceptionally (perhaps the most)
dangerous 6th Ave. crossing, at a busy, complex intersection with an oddly angled left
turn into Greenwich where a concrete refuge island also is needed for protection.
• SW corner of Waverly Pl., another location where motorists turn left from 6th.
• NW corner of Carmine St.
• NW corner of Bleecker St.
• NW corner of W. 4th St.
• NW corner of Washington Pl; (At these remaining four cross streets, motorists turn left
into 6th Ave.); and
Be it further resolved that CB2 requests that DOT put in planters in the concrete pedestrian refuge
islands that will be newly installed, similar to those that DOT previously installed in the concrete
refuge islands on 6th Ave. btw. W. 8th and W. 14th Sts.; and
Be it further resolved that CB2 supports the greater width of the 6th Ave. bike lane from
Lispenard to W. 14th Sts. to accommodate ever-increasing bicycle traffic as well as faster moving
bikes and wider bike configurations; and
Be it further resolved that CB2 strongly recommends that DOT erect signage and other highly
visible cues announcing the upcoming bike path switch from east to west on 6th Ave. at Houston
St. at least one block, or more, in advance of reaching Houston; and
Be it further resolved that CB2 urges the NYC Police Department to increase its assignment of
traffic officers at approaches to the Holland Tunnel to enforce the safe and orderly movement of
motor vehicles to the Tunnel; and
Be it further resolved that CB2 advises DOT to separate 6th Ave.'s Holland Tunnel-bound traffic
from its through traffic through the use of flex posts that form the dividing line between 2 tunnel-
bound lanes on the west and one through-lane on the east, especially in the area of Canal, Watts
and Broome Sts., similar to what is done on Varick St. and on Hudson St.; and
Be it further resolved that CB2 calls upon DOT to conduct a study to identify key spots where
considerable delivery and loading/unloading activities take place on 6th Ave. from Canal St. to
14th St. and based on its findings, to develop and install dedicated loading zones where needed in
that area; and
58Be it finally resolved that CB2 encourages DOT to continue to confer with and monitor the
construction work on 6th Ave. of MTA NYC Transit, particularly at Grand Canal Courts, as well
as with DEP regarding construction at Duarte Sq., and to coordinate 6th Ave. bike lane installation
with these efforts.
Vote: Unanimous, with 39 Board members in favor.
2. Resolution Welcoming Stop Signs on Washington St. at Bank St.
Whereas the intersection where Bank St. crosses Washington St. is the only one where
Washington St. has lacked either a Stop sign or a traffic light as it heads south from the
Meatpacking District to Canal St., creating highly hazardous conditions for both pedestrians and
cyclists crossing Washington at that location as well as for motorists either traveling on
Washington or entering that intersection heading east from Bank, because these conditions have
facilitated fast-moving, non-stop traffic there; and
Whereas there is a traffic light one block immediately north of the Washington/Bank St.
intersection, at Bethune St., and a traffic light one block immediately south, at W. 11th St., which
has exacerbated the tendency for drivers to speed up through Bank St., surging ahead to catch the
next green light and failing to take account of those crossing Washington at Bank while they focus
on trying to beat the light; and
Whereas there are Stop signs on the northwest and southwest corners of Bank St. at Washington
St., but there's a small incline as Bank approaches Washington, interfering with visibility and
making it necessary for drivers to advance halfway into the intersection before they can see
approaching vehicles on Washington, that has further compounded the potential for dangerous
conflicts that now can be avoided with oncoming motorists halted by Stop signs that the NYC
Dept. of Transportation (DOT) now has installed on Washington; and
Whereas there are high visibility crosswalks traversing both the north and south sides of
Washington St., but they have not been accompanied by the customary Stop signs or traffic lights
which are usually required with crosswalks; and
Whereas there has been a pedestrian crossing sign at the northeast corner of Washington St. at
Bank, which has been ignored by motorists, and, as a great majority of Community Board No. 2
Manhattan (CB2) members and community constituents have observed, these types of signs are
neither noticed, nor recognized, nor heeded by drivers and are a weak and useless substitute for
Stop signs and a totally ineffective traffic control. Stop signs are established and easily recognized,
strong in their impact and highly effective; and
59Whereas CB2 has been reporting these conditions and requesting Stop signs on Washington St.
at Bank St. since 2014, 10 years, and constituents have noted that the danger at this crossing goes
back many years before that; and
Whereas numerous complaints have continued to be received regarding this neglected threat to
people's safety which has been worsening as automotive traffic has intensified, pedestrian and
bicycle activity has increased and the population in the West Village area has grown. Constituents
have reported not only endless near misses but also pedestrians hit by vehicles, plus vehicular
collisions, some described vocally or in writing and others documented in photos and video; and
Whereas with the new Greenwich House Senior Center operating at 155 Bank St., a considerable
number of highly vulnerable older people are now and will be using this Washington/Bank St.
intersection frequently and need protection from the non-restrained traffic that has been there,
along with the many others who have been regularly exposed to the dangers of this up to now
uncontrolled crossing; and
Whereas this area is particularly crowded with pedestrians going back and forth all day: the many
local families who reside there, people on their way to and from the Hudson River Park, children
from the West Village Houses and Westbeth crossing Washington St. on their way to and from
P.S. 41, P.S. 3 and other local schools, those heading to MS297/75 Morton, students going to the
New School for Drama, preschoolers and their parents coming to the Perry Nursery School,
patrons of the Westbeth Theater, people walking to art events at the Westbeth galleries, as well as
bicyclists accessing the Citi Bike station on Bank St. and cycling across Washington St., all who
have been exposed to the constant danger of oncoming, non-stopping, swift vehicular traffic; and
Whereas scaffolding juts out on the west side of Washington St. in relation to masonry and facade
work that is being done there in Westbeth buildings beginning at 137 Bank St./744 Washington
St. at the northwest Washington/Bank St. corner and going north to Bethune St., obscuring
visibility. This will need to remain for approximately two more years; and
Whereas in past evaluations of this extremely dangerous situation at Washington and Bank St.,
DOT has relied rigidly on formulas such as those in the MUTCD (Manual on Uniform Traffic
Control Devices), but these are only guidelines that don't reflect the actual day-to-day experience
of those who live around and/or constantly use this intersection and are regularly exposed to the
hazardous conditions at that location, a situation that it has been imperative to correct; and
Whereas DOT has now recognized the dangerous conditions at this intersection with its
installation of Stop signs on the northeast and northwest corners of Washington St. at Bank St.;
Therefore be it resolved that CB2 thanks DOT for installing Stop signs on the northeast and
northwest corners of Washington St. at Bank St.; and
60Be it further resolved that CB2 further thanks DOT for adjusting the Stop sign placement on the
northwest side of Washington St. at Bank St. to avoid interference with visibility by the existing
scaffolding; and
Be it further resolved that CB2 appreciates DOT's recognition of the day-to-day experiences and
observations of those who live around and/or constantly use this intersection and have been
regularly exposed to the hazardous conditions at this location; and
Be it finally resolved that CB2 strongly recommends that DOT paint STOP on the roadbed of
Washington St. as it approaches Bank St. without delay to provide needed extra protection from
the untenable traffic conditions at this location that have required remediation for so long.
Vote: Unanimous, with 39 Board members in favor.

PUBLIC SESSION
Elijah Walker
• Speaker claims to be Elijah the Prophet. Speaking to things in the world that need to be
stopped, including homelessness, the war in Israel, abortion.
Leslie Clark
• Speaking about DOT request for waivers for roadway dining on narrow streets.
• Speaker praises the Outdoor Dining Working Group and notes that it has done an excellent
job. Attended the DOT hearing on 242 West 10th Street today. Was distressed to hear that
this applicant applied for a waiver for an emergency travel lane. The DOT had applied for
the emergency travel lane on behalf of the applicant.
• Is this a closed process, or can the community give input into the application?
Jacob Sadrak
• Speaker is concerned about the use of Hudson River Park tennis courts by private coaches.
Hudson River Park Tennis Courts are supposed to be used under an honor system, but
coaches are using them for private lessons during prime hours in the morning. Coaches
stack the line, or pay people to wait on line for them, in order to hold a monopoly on these
public spaces. Posted signs clearly state that professional lessons are not allowed. There
was a recent article in the NY Post about this.
• Additional speaker notes that Hudson River Park Conservancy is aware of this issue. It also
came up at the Parks and Waterfront Committee.
Jane Carey (Whitney Museum of American Art)
• West Side Fest 2024 is returning after its inaugural year in 2023 and expanding to three
days from one. West Side Fest will run from July 12-14. The hope is to make this an annual
event on the second weekend of July. Free admission and multiple activities at multiple
locations on the far West Side for the public.
• The Whitney is celebrating Pride across the month of June. There will be a street closure
event for Queer Teen Night on the last weekend of June. The event involving the street
closure is in coordination with the Meatpacking BID to kick off Pride. “Happy Hopper
Day” is upcoming on July 20th.
3Zack Winestine
• Speaking on behalf of Save Gansevoort with an update on Section 106 review of West
Village 5G towers.
• Good news is that the towers were subject to a Section 106 review to assess whether there
would be adverse impacts from the installation of these 32-foot tall towers on the adjacent
historic districts.
• Bad news is that the applicant has gone to the FCC asking the State Historic Preservation
Office to overturn its prior decision to oppose the installation of the towers as negatively
affecting the historic districts.
• The FCC should do the right thing and respect the SHPO decision.
Darlene Lutz
• The 1st Precinct Community Council will take part in National Night Out on August 6th –
to be held at the South Street Seaport.
• Concern about the privatizing of the Hudson River Park tennis courts.
• The 1st Precinct Community Council will meet on June 29, and then break for the summer.
• Speaking as a private citizen on congestion pricing. Would like the opportunity to discuss
congestion pricing as a community.
Lois Rakoff
• The last Washington Square Music Festival event for 2024 will be on Tuesday, June 25th
in Washington Square Park.

ADOPTION OF MINUTES
The minutes of the May 2024 Full Board were adopted by acclamation.
BUSINESS SESSION
Chair's Report: Susan Kent
Website Updates
• CB2 has begun the process of building an Airtable-based database for our website.
o Moving as quickly as possible so as to capture remaining funds from FY2024
budget.
o Working with Beta NYC.
o For context, please review of Board 5, 6 and 7 websites, as they have have recently
switched to use of this new functionality.
o Seeking input from Committee Chairs around tags for searchability. Will be
migrating past resolutions to new platform.
Washington Square Park Conservancy
• Cormac Flynn is taking over as representative to the Washington Square Park
Conservancy, replacing Kristin Shea.
Hudson River Park Advisory Council
• Susan Kent will be taking over as representative to Hudson River Park Advisory Council,
replacing Dan Miller. Other boards (1 and 4) are represented by their Chairs.
Borough Board
7• Meeting focused on City of Yes for Housing Opportunity. Public Hearing was held, but
there were no speakers. Majority of session was spent taking questions and comments from
the Chairs. No vote was taken, as only two boards have voted on City of Yes for Housing
Opportunity to date.
New Community Board Members
• Welcome to new member, Juliet Kaye!
District Manager’s Report: Mark Diller
Website Updates
• Working with BetaNYC to explore ways to use Airtable to search and maintain resolutions
on our website while preserving aspects of the functionality of our website. Currently the
website is hosted on WordPress.
• Beta NYC is developing a procedure so that past CB2 resolutions, which were bundled and
uploaded to the website by Committee, can be separated into individual resolutions. The
individual resolutions will facilitate searchability, but will require staff time to rename.
Comptroller's Office Audit
• Office is subject to a system-wide Comptroller's audit. Unlike previous Comptroller audits,
which tested the Community Boards’ compliance with Open Meeting Law and
documentation requirements, this audit will attempt to track personnel services and OTPS
spending processes. CB2’s District Office will be required to produce documentation to
support procurement and salary expenditures, even though those expenditures are
monitored by the FMS system in the Comptroller’s and OMB’s offices. This is a
challenging process -- for example, the Comptroller's Office does not have access to our
payroll records, which may require manual compilation of screenshots.
• CB2 has sufficient funds to pay all current expenses.
CB2 P-Card
• BP's office thinks they can support CB2’s years-long application to acquire a P-Card for
the office.
Vital Parks for All
• Initiative to support equity initiatives to ensure that green spaces are as available in under-
resourced neighborhoods as any others.
Open Meetings Law
8• Bill that would have reduced quorum requirement to 25% did not pass the Legislature this
term.
• Sunset expiration of the Open Meetings Law provisions allowing remote meeting
participation was extended to 2026.
Calendar and Upcoming Events
• Land Use has added a meeting on Monday, June 24th. NYU has agreed to host.
• The “Future of Community Boards” Group, together with the Center for Urban Pedagogy,
will host a meeting to plan for term limits for Community Boards.
July 4th Holiday Hours
• Office will be closed early, after 1pm, on Friday the 5th. Office will be open on July 3rd.

1. [This item is being handled at LPC Staff level, and was withdrawn from CB2 action.]
2. *117 7th Ave. So. – Application is to approve the color of the doors and windows of the
ground floor remaining in dark wood.
Whereas:
The dark wood for the doors and windows in the current condition is a natural wood color and is
entirely suitable to the building and the district; now

natural wood for the doors and windows.
Vote: Unanimous, with 38 Board members in favor.
3. *402 W. Broadway – Application is to paint the ground floor retail exterior and steps,
install window sign, place blade signs on either side of the corner entrance and flag above
one of the blade signs.
Whereas:
A. The black ground floor facades and steps are to be painted off white; and
B. Though the rendering depicted pure white paint, the applicant represented that the color is to
be a soft white and no specifications or sample was provided; and
9C. The name of the business is in paste-on lettering on the transoms above the doors and similar
logos are attached to the windows elsewhere; and
D. Two blade signs, 24 inches by 36 inches, are on either side of the corner entrance and were
represented by the applicant as conforming to applicable regulations; and
E. A flag was depicted on the rendering as large and white, hanging above one of the blade signs
and the presentations and the applicant had no information as to its size and exact color and
content; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:

off white without reflectivity; and
B. Approval of the window lettering and logos, provided that Commission staff affirms that they
conform to applicable regulations; and
C. Approval of the two blade signs, provided the Commission staff affirms that they conform to
applicable regulations; and
D. Denial of any flag in that the two blade signs at the entryway, together with the white facade
and window lettering are sufficient to identify the location of the establishment.
Vote: Unanimous, with 38 Board members in favor.
4. *69 W. 9th St. – Application is to replace the existing stone cladding with new stone
cladding, replace the existing fence and gate with new fence and gate, enlarge the existing
planter, install one new planter and install a new canvas sidewalk awning with lighting at
the building entrance.
Whereas:
A. The location of the apartment building is at the corner of Sixth Avenue and 9th Street and there
is an entrance to the PATH train station within the 9th Street facade which attracts loiterers and
parts of the proposed work are to add security for the building; and

Vote: Unanimous, with 38 Board members in favor.
5. *61 Charles St.- Application is to repair and restore front facade, install historical railing
and gate at stoop, install historical lintels and areaway planter, reconfigure areaway steps,
and construct rear yard two story extension and penthouse, and install HVAC equipment on
roof.
Whereas:
A. The front facade is to be restored with removal of parlor floor window guards, restoration of
lintels, and iron work, (railings, posts, railing with gate) copying the next-door building’s
historically correct, possibly original, design in unacceptable cast aluminum when accurate
reproduction in cast iron is available; and
B. The areaway is to be considerably reconfigured to a historic design with excavation, lowering
the windows, and applying rusticated stucco representing brownstone at the basement level which
properly covers the entire base of the facade; and
C. At the rear facade a 4-foot extension with full width multi pane windows in white brick is
similar to approved extensions in neighboring buildings; and
D. The third and fourth floor rear wall is to be reconstructed with full width grey metal multi-pane
windows and windows of unusual size and shape and reconfiguration of the windows at the fourth
floor; and
E. The strong preference for third and fourth floors of row houses is to preserve the tripart punched
window configuration in the reconstructed original plane of the facade to recall the historic design
with the usual proportions and in this instance, it would be acceptable to change one window at
the third floor to a door to provide access to the terrace; and
F. The 100 square foot penthouse in glass and stucco is 10’ high, extends 8’6” above the parapet
and is not visible from a public thoroughfare; and
11G. There is a fence around three sides of the roof that is in the usual dark metal and is very
minimally visible from the public thoroughfare; and
H. There is a 3’ deep excavation of a substantial area of the cellar, the area aligning with the same
level beneath the extension and a minimal excavation of a few feet of the garden at the basement;
and
I. The excavation requires underpinning along most of the length of both sides of the building and
the applicant represented that proper steps would occur, including engaging engineers, to ensure
the integrity of adjoining buildings and the subject building; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:
A. Approval of the front facade restoration apart from the iron work; and
B. Denial of the aluminum stair railing, posts, fence, and gate and require that they be fabricated
in historic cast iron; and
C. Approval of the areaway provided that the rusticated stucco covers the entire to the basement
level of the facade; and
D. Approval of the rear extension and windows on the basement and parlor floors; and
E. Denial of the windows on the third and fourth floors and require that they be in the original
historic configuration with a door to the third-floor terrace, and
F. Approval of the non-visible penthouse and required safety railing on the roof; and
G. Approval of the excavation, provided that care is taken to follow all Department of Buildings
and Landmarks Commission regulations to ensure the integrity of the neighboring buildings and
the subject property.
Vote: Unanimous, with 38 Board members in favor.
6. *64 Horatio St. – Application is to enlarge basement and first floor rear facade windows,
change 2nd floor door to a window, remove balconies, skylight, and visible HVAC units to
the roof.
7. *66 Horatio St. - Application is to replace windows with wood clad aluminum sash at
front and side facades, alter basement at front facade and add fence to match #64;
reposition side facade windows, lower stucco base and remove doors, reconfigure rear
12addition facade openings, reposition rear facade windows at floors 2 and 3, enlarge
basement and 1st floor openings, add stair to yard and excavate to lower cellar.
Note: The applications for 64 and 66 Horatio Street are for the two houses which are to
be combined. The applicant made one presentation for the entire project and this
resolution is for both buildings.
Whereas:
A. The two row houses which are to be combined into one single family house are 64 Horatio
which is intact and 66 Horatio, the adjacent corner house which is of a different design and has
been considerably altered to provide for various commercial establishments on the ground floor;
and
B. The restoration of 66 will draw upon historic details from 64 to inform the restoration,
especially of the facade; and
C. The front facade of 66 will be restored with a depressed front entrance and two windows typical
of row houses from which the stoop has been removed, and
D. The areaway of 66 will be reconstructed in the historic manner; and
E. At the side facade of 66 the windows will be repositioned in the same vertical plane and their
heights adjusted to conform to the new floor levels aligned with 64, the brick will be repaired and
the brownstone street level cladding will continue the line of the base from the front facade; and
F. The extension will continue the brownstone finish with three blind windows in the same
material; and
G. Minimal excavation within the property will be made to align the garden of 66 with 64 and the
applicant represented that engineers have been engaged and that all procedures from the
Department of Buildings and the Landmarks Commission will be followed; and
H. The rear facade basement and parlor levels have full width, multi-pane, metal windows similar
to those approved for similar houses in the district and the second and third floors have restored
historic tripartite punched windows; and
I. Two mechanical units will be placed on the roof of 64 positioned to achieve minimal visibility
from Greenwich Street and there is no visibility from Horatio Street; and
J. There was public testimony opposing some aspects of the application; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:
13A. Approval of the application for alteration of the facades of 64 Horatio St. which
commendably preserves separation of two distinct buildings, the treatment of the
extension facade, and the rear facade windows and restoration of both buildings; and
B. Approval of the excavation, provided that care is taken to preserve the integrity of the
buildings and to observe all Department of Buildings and Landmarks Commission
regulations.
Vote: Unanimous, with 38 Board members in favor.
LAND USE
CB2 response to NYC HPD’s Community Visioning Report for 388 Hudson Street.
Whereas:
1. NYC HPD released its Community Visioning Report for 388 Hudson Street on April 10,
2024. The CB2 Land Use and Housing Committee continues to have concerns.
2. CB2 has repeatedly asked that a NYC Parks Department Recreation Center be placed on the
lower or basement floors. The CVR does not emphasize that request.
3. CB2 does not want a curtain wall. The CVR supports large windows but not floor-to-ceiling
windows.
4. CB2 sees no need for an affordable grocery store on the ground floor. CB2 is not a food
desert. The CVR supports the inclusion of a grocery store.
5. CB2 supports the use of bricks, not concrete, for the façade so that the building refers to the
historic context of Greenwich Village. The CVR does not emphasize this preference.
6. CB2 has consistently stressed the importance of design excellence with creative solutions for
this project. The CVR does not reflect that opinion emphatically.
Therefore be it resolved that CB2 requests that NYC HPD communicate CB2’s opinions
prominently in the upcoming RFP.
Vote: Passed, with 33 Board members in favor, 5 abstentions (A. Diaz, R. Kessler, J. Liff, m.
Metzger, E. Siegel).
OUTDOOR DINING
14Application to DOT for a Sidewalk Cafe:
West10West LLC dba West10West, 242 West 10th Street, 10014 with two tables and four
chairs (Dining Out NYC – Sidewalk Cafe)
Whereas, the comments related to the sidewalk cafe setup’s physical footprint and dimensions:
• West 10th Street, a narrow residential street, between Hudson Street and Bleecker
Street, where this establishment is located has many concurrent important
neighborhood uses where safety is a factor including the MTA M8 bus route, an
official NYC DOT Shared bike lane, the primary entrance for the NYPD 6th Precinct
station and NYPD Bomb Squad and service vehicle entrances for both located just
east of the West10West LLC roadway cafe on the north side of West 10th Street;
• The Applicant submitted a proposed site plan which omits three (3) separate key
elements/objects and measurements which impact the siting of a sidewalk cafe:
o (1) The primary residential doorway to the west for 244 West 10th St is not
indicated and the requisite 5-foot clearance from the edge of the doorway is
not included in the site plan;
o (2) The primary residential doorway to the east for Applicant’s own building,
242 West 10th Street, is not indicated and the requisite 5-foot clearance from
the edge of the doorway is not included in the site plan;
o (3) While shown on the diagram, the existing street tree bed in front of the
Applicant’s own doorway is not indicated as a furnishing zone element and
the requisite 8-foot measurement from the corner of the street tree bed to the
sidewalk cafe is not indicated on the site plan;
• Existing Primary Entrances and Doorways: The proposed sidewalk cafe site plan is
missing two primary building entrances, one to the east and one to the west:
o Entrance to the west: The primary residential building entrance for 244 West
10th Street to the west of West10West is 3 feet, 4 inches from the perimeter of
the proposed sidewalk cafe footprint, which does not meet the DOT-required
5-foot clearance for primary building entrances;
o Entrance to the east: The primary building entrance for 242 West 10th Street
to the east of West10West is 4 feet, 7 inches from the perimeter of the
proposed sidewalk footprint, which does not meet the DOT-required 5-foot
clearance for primary building entrances, and this measurement is superseded
by the required measurement from the edge of the existing street tree bed;
• Existing Street Tree Bed: The proposed sidewalk cafe site plan does not include the
measurement from the corner of the existing street tree bed in front of the entrance to
15242 West 10th Street to the corner of the sidewalk cafe foot print, the street tree bed
includes significantly raised roots above the sidewalk level and also has a bench built
around the tree pit, based on the proposed site plan, that actual measurement is about
5 feet from the proposed sidewalk cafe footprint, well short of the required 8-foot
clearance if taken in a radius to maintain the required 8-foot clear path required for a
Neighborhood Corridor street;
• The proposed sidewalk cafe footprint in the site plan is 8.2 feet long by 3.5 feet wide
but is missing three (3) key elements as described above. Including the
measurements from the 3 key elements/objects and the required clearances would
reduce the area where a sidewalk café may be permitted to a non-rectangular area of
what would appear to not reasonably fit a table and two chairs; and
Whereas, the comments related to pedestrian flow are as follows:
• The establishment is located on a Neighborhood Corridor (West 10th Street between
Hudson Street and Bleecker Street) which requires an 8-foot clear path on the
sidewalk. The proposed site plan and sidewalk cafe footprint as indicated on the site
plan omits the 8-foot measurement and clear path requirement from the street tree bed
edge in front of the entrance to 242 West 10th Street which impacts pedestrian flow.
That required 8-foot measurement from the street tree bed edge, which is located
within the sidewalk furnishing zone, if properly included in the site plan would
encroach significantly into the proposed sidewalk cafe footprint as described in the
physical footprint and dimensions section;
• There is also a proposed roadway cafe dining setup at this same location with very
tight clearances, and it is imperative that any wait staff service to either the roadway
cafe setup or sidewalk cafe setup occur entirely within each area so as not to impede
the required 8-foot clear path;
• The application form is not complete and accurate as confirmed by the Applicant who
appeared via Zoom at the CB2 Outdoor Dining Working Group Public Hearing on
Wednesday, May 22, 2024, with the following omissions noted:
o The photographs submitted with the application do not show the existing
street tree bed.
o The 8-foot measurement from the street tree bed is not shown (S-06).
o The measurement of the distance from the primary residential entrance to the
left of the establishment at 242 West 10th Street. is not shown (S-22).
o The measurement of the distances from the primary residential entrances to
the right of the establishment at 244 West 10th Street. is not shown (S-22).
16o Under Material Requirements, the Applicant does not confirm whether or not
the furniture (as outlined in their site plan) is lightweight and easily removable
as well confirm whether or not it will be affixed to the sidewalk; and
Whereas, the comments related to potential conflicts with existing curb use (i.e. planters, bike
racks, bus stops) are as follows:
• The application form is not complete and accurate as confirmed by the Applicant who
appeared via Zoom at the CB2 Outdoor Dining Working Group Public Hearing on
Wednesday, May 22, 2024;
• The Applicant confirmed verbally via Zoom on Wednesday, May 22, 2024, that as
noted on the site plan, they will remove the seating that is built around the tree pit,
which is not permitted and located in the furnishing zone, in order to be in
compliance with the Dining Out NYC rules; and
Whereas, the recommended modifications for the sidewalk cafe setup are:
• Recommend that the applicant update the incomplete application form and resubmit it
to DOT and MCB2 inclusive of the list of recommended modifications below:
• Recommend the applicant remove the seating around the tree pit;
• Recommend the applicant update the site plan and sidewalk cafe footprint to show the
required elements including the two residential doorways for 242 West 10th Street,
and 244 West 10th Street and the required 5-foot clearance and include the required
8-foot clearance from the corner of the street tree bed and show a continuing 8-foot
clear path around the sidewalk cafe and objects in the furnishing zone and re-submit
the updated site plan and sidewalk cafe footprint to DOT and MCB2;
• Recommend the applicant reduce the number of tables and chairs in the sidewalk cafe
setup to no more than one table with two chairs, if those can even be demonstrated to
fit in the resulting permitted area; the site plan should include the specific dimensions
of tables and chairs and an area to serve from that also includes full and constant
clearance for the required 8-foot clear path in their updated sidewalk cafe site plan;
• Recommend that the applicant add the measurement of the existing street tree bed to
S-06 on the form;
17• Recommend that the applicant add the measurement of the distance from the primary
residential entrance to the left of the establishment for 242 West 10th Street to S-22
on the form;
• Recommend that the applicant add the measurement of the distance from the primary
entrance to the right of the establishment for 244 West 10th Street to S-22 on the
form;
• Recommend that the applicant indicate under Section 3: Material Requirements on
the form whether or not the furniture indicated on the sidewalk cafe site plan will be
lightweight and easily removable as well as not affixed to the sidewalk;
• Recommend that there is sufficient room for all wait staff service to the one table and
two chairs in the sidewalk cafe from within the footprint so that there is no
encroachment on the required 8-foot clear path on the sidewalk; this is especially
important given this narrow sidewalk which also has a proposed roadway cafe dining
setup.
Therefore Be It Resolved, CB2, Man. recommends denial of the Dining Out NYC sidewalk
cafe for West10West LLC dba West10West, 242 West 10th Street, 10014 because the
applicant’s proposed site plan as referred by DOT does not meet the measurement requirements
for distances from primary building entrances as described above nor does the applicant’s
proposed site plan meet the required measurements from furnishing zone elements or conform
to the clear path requirement for a Neighborhood Corridor street as described above.
Vote: Unanimous, with 38 Board members in favor.
Board Operations Process for Dining Out NYC
Whereas, the Community Board and the community it represents should have an opportunity to
review and comment on roadway cafes and sidewalk cafes, and
Whereas, the timeframe for reviewing Dining Out NYC applications is 30 days for roadway cafes
and 40 days for sidewalk cafes as mandated by NYC DOT rules for the program, and
Whereas, NYC DOT refers Dining Out NYC applications to community boards on Mondays only,
there are only two opportunities a month for applications to be referred to the board in time for the
18Outdoor Dining Working Group to hold a public hearing and produce a resolution for that month’s
full board meeting, and
Whereas, 30 days – and sometimes 40 days – is not enough time to bring a resolution to the Full
Board, and
Whereas, DOT automatically schedules all Dining Out NYC roadway cafe public hearings on the
day after the 30-day community board comment period for roadway cafe applications leaving no
flexibility to submit comment before the DOT public hearing on the roadway cafe application after
the community board comment deadline, now
Therefore Be It Resolved, that the Outdoor Dining Working Group resolutions, with respect to a
Dining Out NYC application, will be considered the decision of Manhattan CB2 if the DOT-
mandated application deadline falls before next Full Board meeting and as such will be transmitted
to the appropriate agency(ies) as Committee Actions.
Vote: Unanimous, with 38 Board members in favor.
PARKS AND WATERFRONT
A Resolution Supporting the Proposed Design of a New Public Open Space at 388 Hudson
WHEREAS:
1. The NYC Department of Parks and Recreation, working with the Hudson Square BID who
hired MNLA Landscape Architects with W X Y architecture + urban design, presented a
proposed design of a new public, passive open space at the former water tunnel site at 388
Hudson St., the Hudson Houston Plaza, on the southern half of the lot on the east side of Hudson
Street at Houston St. (The northern half is expected to be occupied by a new affordable housing
building.)
2. This site, which is .25 of an acre, will be the third former water tunnel site in our district
to be converted into passive open space. (The two other sites are 142 Grand St. and 35 E
4 St.) Such sites have design constraints due to the restrictions on foundations and
structures and the requirement of having to ensure continuous Department of
Environmental Protection (DEP) access to site for maintenance and emergencies.
3. The project has a budget of $3.62M.
194. The project timeline is estimated to be between three and four years.
5. A community engagement process started earlier this year and included multiple public
input sessions and generated over 450 responses.
6. Design preferences conveyed by the community included robust landscaping, flexibility
of space, and available seating.
7. Guiding principles were established, based on community feedback, which focus on
creating a welcoming, flexible, and engaging public space that maximizes green space;
incorporates colorful and fun elements; creates inclusive spaces to accommodate a
variety of users throughout the day; and maintains site accessibility and visibility with a
transparent fence.
8. The proposed design showed elements including modular furnishings, trees and greenery
planted to the extent permitted by the technical constraints of the site, umbrellas for
flexible shade cover, a “daydreamer interactive sit/swing feature”, trellises on two
perimeters for additional shade, transparent fencing and a welcoming main entrance, all
aimed at creating a versatile, green, and community-focused space.
9. Expected entrances will be two for DEP trucks via West Houston and Hudson Streets and
two for pedestrians. The main pedestrian entrance will be at the corner of Hudson and
West Houston Streets and a secondary entrance will be on West Houston.
10. Trees will dominate the northeast side of the space, where deeper planting is permitted, in
order to generate maximum green space and shade; moveable umbrellas will provide
additional shade without in-ground installations. There was some discussion about the
advisability of using multiple trees to so firmly delineate the northern border of the park
site before the building on the adjacent HPD site has been designed. Illumination of the
tree area for public safety was also discussed.
11. Trellis integration will be implemented on the south and west sides to provide additional
shade, aligning with community preferences. There was some discussion about whether
the trellis should be planted or not, given the failure of the planted trellis at 18th St. on the
High Line and the success of the unplanted trellis at the NYC AIDS Memorial Park on
12th St. and Greenwich Ave.
12. Surfaces will use permeable pavers in open spaces.
13. Furnishings will be moveable, including modular benches on casters, and designed for
reconfiguration, adaptability and flexibility and to accommodate different group sizes and
activities.
14. Interactive and flexible elements will be installed, including two “Daydreamer”
interactive features, which are rocking and spinning pieces that emit sounds and lights.
The sounds are designed not to be heard beyond the perimeter of the Daydreamers.
15. The City as School mural on the east side is expected to be retained.
16. Lighting will include pole lights along the fence for general illumination and bollard
lighting for pathway lighting.
17. Planting strategies will work to achieve neighborhood cohesion, sustainability, ecological
benefits, and be a reflection of the creative spirit of the neighborhood. The plant palette
will include ferns, grasses, bulbs, and perennials with a cooler color palette.
2018. Tree selections are expected to be lilac and Persian Ironwood species; vines will be
honeysuckle and traffic creeper.
19. There is a 10’ setback from the park border to the adjacent building site, which DEP
requires be a no-drill zone. The committee discussed possible strategies for this area and
the importance of maximizing use of that space.
20. Committee members questioned what types of activations would be permitted in the park
and whether corporate and commercial events would be allowed.
21. There was discussion of the fact that the final designs of the public spaces at the other
two water tunnel sites turned out to be much simplified from the designs that were
presented to and approved by our committee.
22. The role of the BID in maintaining the space was deemed important in order to keep the
park clean and enhance the plantings, coordinate access with DEP, and provide maximum
use to park visitors.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that Manhattan Community Board 2:
1. Supports the goals of the project, agrees with the guiding principles conveyed, and
approves and appreciates the design choices proposed.
2. Relies on the Parks Dept. to ensure that the installation of this project produces a result
that corresponds closely to the plans that were presented.
3. Asks that the Hudson Square BID return to the Parks committee to discuss what types of
activations and uses will be encouraged, noting that we oppose any corporate and
commercial events in the space.
4. Expects that the BID will maintain the park in perpetuity to ensure high quality care of
the space.
5. Asks that the Parks Dept. reach out to HPD and DEP so that the agencies can collaborate
in putting the 10’ no-drill zone to the most productive use possible.
Vote: Passed, with 36 Board members in favor and 1 abstention (R. Kessler).

Out NYC–sidewalk) (previously unlicensed)
i. Whereas, the Applicant appeared before Community Board 2, Manhattan’s SLA Committee
#1 to present an application to the NYS Liquor Authority for a Tavern Wine License to operate
a vintage clothing store in a four (4)-story, C6-1-zoned, commercial building (ca. 1878) on
the Bowery between Bleecker and East Houston Streets (Block #521/Lot #81), this building
falling within NYC LPC’s designated NoHo East Historic District and the Special Little Italy

application at the meeting; and
iv. Whereas, the previously unlicensed premises is the old Patricia Fields boutique clothing store
which operated at this location from 2006 to 2012 and has more recently been operating from
2013 to 2022 as Olde Good Things which sold architectural antiques and salvage items along
with some vintage clothing and most recently as LINES which is a tattoo and fashion studio
with a community centered space; and
v. Whereas, the Applicant currently has four other outposts of Garage Sale Vintage (GSV)
with two in Tennessee and two in Colorado, some if not all of them have full liquor licenses,
all of them branded under the same website and are described in social media, community and
tourist guides as vintage clothing store and bar, the Applicant quoted as calling his Boulder,
CO store/bar/taco restaurant “spicy hot vintage” because of the collection of hot sauces, there
being daily bar specials and an extensive beer selection in addition to Mezcal and tequila,
special days where the roll of a dice determines the price of a drink; the GSV website
promotes “Bar Hangs – drink while you shop in store” raising concerns that the bar component
of the operation is a central theme in their marketing and is unlike other retail establishments
that offer it as an amenity to shopping but not part of their marketing materials, the Applicant
not being forthcoming regarding the role of the bar and drink aspect of the business; the
Applicant is also the principal of Good Baby Management located in Denver, CO, which is
a retail hospitality group that specializes in placemaking and brand development services,
raising further concerns that gathering and drinking will be the primary function of the
premises in the later hours with the shopping becoming the ancillary business; and
vi. Whereas, residents of the next door building appeared to speak in opposition to the
application, specifically the midnight and 2 AM hours for what is being described as a vintage
26clothing retail establishment, the immediate area having already having a number of late night
bar establishments including 310 Bowery Group LLC dba 310 Bowery Bar (Lic ID #0340-
23-133813), Griffs Global Corp Operator/Bowery Poetry Club Inc dba Duane Park BPC (Lic
ID #0370-24-113478) – a burlesque and live music venue at 308 Bowery, and P G T Rest
Corp dba Slainte (Lic ID #0370-240101413) at 304 Bowery and Tom and Jerrys Bar Rest Inc
(Lic ID #0340-21-117850) around the corner at 288 Elizabeth Street, there being crowding
on their sidewalk due to the daytime tourists and late night bar activities and the quality of
life issues including noise from groups of people, random pressing of their home buzzers in
the evening and early morning hours and loitering, the residents supporting having a vintage
clothing store without outdoor seating and earlier hours but the proposed hours were not in
alignment with other retail establishment and were also not in alignment with area restaurants
such as Little Rest LLC (Lic ID #0340-23-128365) at 290 Elizabeth, Torien (Lic ID #0524-
24-14891) at 292 Elizabeth which close not later than 1 AM on the weekends, residents also
had concerns with any outdoor seating and in particular outdoor seating going until midnight
every night creating even more of a noise disturbance; and
vii. Whereas, there was no Certificate of Occupancy provided or able to be found on DOB’s
website, there is an older Schedule “A” online showing the existing use of the cellar to be
storage with no proposed change in use and the ground floor to be a store, the Applicant
having no plans to change the Certificate of Occupancy although the diagrams presented and
method of operation described is to use the cellar as additional active retail space where
patrons shop and congregate, the method of operation also being that patrons can get drinks
at the bar and bring them throughout the store with both the cellar and ground floor being the
entirety of the licensed premises; and
viii. Whereas, the primary business of the application being presented is that of a vintage clothing
retail store located in the majority of the storefront, in the rear of the store there is an ancillary
bar with 10 barstools, and 4 tables and 8 seats, there is also a food preparation area behind the
bar where the Applicant intends to microwave tacos which he will order from Sysco
Corporation and will also offer nachos and chips with queso; and
ix. Whereas, the posted hours of operation of the Applicant’s other locations being not later than
midnight on Fridays and Saturdays and earlier closing hours during the week, the Applicant
was asked if they would consider earlier closing hours of 10 PM weekdays and 11 PM
weekends which the applicant would not agree to, the applicant did offer to reduce their hours
to 12 AM Sunday to Thursday and 1 AM Friday and Saturday, following the meeting, in an
effort to reach a compromise and alleviate the concerns that the method of operation would
morph into a bar scene in the evening at this previously unlicensed location, the Applicant
was offered to have later retail hours, with alcohol service ending at 10 PM weekdays and
2711 PM weekends; the Applicant’s representative stated that those hours were not acceptable
and they would file the application with the SLA without any agreement in place; and
x. Whereas, other retail stores in the area and in CB2 which also hold a variety of liquor licenses
close at hours which are consistent with retail store hours, mostly closing at 8 or 9 PM, those
hours of operation being acceptable to the community; and
xi. Whereas, while this application is for the service of Beer and Wine only and therefore not
subject to any requirements for public interest, convenience or advantage or any other public
review, there already are a significant number of licensed establishments in both Community
Board 2 and in the immediate area, there being 52 active licensed premises within 750 feet
of the proposed premises according to LAMP to be licensed and an additional 6 pending
licenses within this same area; and
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that Community Board 2, Manhattan recommends denial of
the application for a Tavern Wine License GSV NYC 2 LLC dba Garage Sale Vintage 302
Bowery 10012; and
THEREFORE BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that should this application be considered by
the NYSLA, CB2, Man. respectfully requests that this item be calendared to appear before the Full
Board of the NYSLA before any license, temporary or otherwise is issued to this Applicant; and
THEREFORE, BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that if despite CB2, Man.’s objections to this
Application, should the NYSLA not find good cause to deny this Application, CB2 Man.
recommends in the alternative that the following stipulations be imposed on any future Tavern
Wine license for GSV NYC 2 LLC dba Garage Sale Vintage 02 Bowery 10012:
1. Provide a valid Certificate of Occupancy or Letter of No Objection showing that the store
use proposed for the cellar is permitted in addition to use as an Eating and Drinking
establishment in advance of the issuance of any license in order to demonstrate an ability
to conform with SLA Rule 48.3 (Section 48.3 - Conformance with local and other
regulations. The Authority expects all on-premises licensees, regardless of type of
premises, to conform with all applicable building codes, fire, health, safety and
governmental regulations.)

284. Iaccas Corp dba Old Fashion Cafe 110 Thompson St 10012 (OP–Restaurant) (Alteration)
i. Whereas, the Applicant appeared before Community Board 2, Manhattan’s SLA Licensing
Committee #1 to present an application for an Alteration to the existing On-Premises
Restaurant license (SN#0340-23-136034, legacy #1348100, exp 3/31/2025) to continue to
operate a café and bistro in a residentially only zoned area in the non-conforming basement
space of a six (6)-story, residential walk-up building (c. 1900, zoned R7-2) on Thompson
Street between Spring and Prince Streets (Block 502/Lot 12), the building falling within
NYC’s LPC-designated Sullivan-Thompson Historic District; and
ii. Whereas, the current premises is in a 750 sq. ft. cellar space accessed via a sidewalk stairway,
with 10 tables and 31 seats and one (1) stand up bar with four (4) seats, the alteration is to add
the adjacent 250 sq. ft. cellar space which is connected on the interior via a hallway of which
the Applicant has exclusive use of, the added non-conforming basement space previously
operated as a psychic has its own entry doorway via sidewalk stairs which is separated from
the existing restaurant entry by the residential building entrance; the added storefront will
have approximately 13 tables and 26 seats for a total seated occupancy of 61, there are no
TVs, there is a full service kitchen, two (2) bathrooms and two (2) doorways for patron ingress
and egress; and
iii. Whereas, the Applicant has been operating since Fall/2022 with stipulated closing hours
being 12 AM Sundays through Thursdays and 1 AM Fridays and Saturdays; music will
remain quiet background only consisting of music from iPod/CDs; there will be no dancing,
DJs, live music, promoted events, scheduled performances or cover fees, velvet ropes or
movable barriers, security personnel or doorman; and
iv. Whereas, the Applicant had previously appeared before CB2, Man. in January/2024 for a
change in method of operation to close an hour later each night (1 AM Sundays through
Thursdays and 2 AM Fridays and Saturdays) at which time the board recommended denial of
the application for reasons laid out in the resolution which included complaints from nearby
residents, including those that support the restaurant, of noise from patrons leaving and
mingling around the stairwell especially at closing, the Applicant choosing not to move
forward with the application at the NYSLA; and
v. Whereas, a local neighborhood association reached out to residents on the block and
submitted testimony of the same complaints that were voiced in January/2024, those
complaints being of patrons congregating, talking loudly and smoking in the entry, especially
upon leaving the premises, and were concerned that with the expansion of the premises adding
another entryway on the opposite side of the building’s residential doorway, the congregating
of patrons and associated smoking and noise would be increased with the Applicant to date
not exhibiting the means to control their patrons once they exited the premises, residents did
29not have complaints about the interior operation and two residents came to speak in favor of
the application; and
vi. Whereas, included in the initial application was sidewalk seating consisting of two (2) tables
and four (4) chairs as part of the temporary Open Restaurants program, the premises being
below grade and therefore not eligible for the program as it applied to ground floor premises
only, this being a residentially-zoned neighborhood with narrow sidewalks where outdoor
seating had never previously been permitted, the outdoor seating of nearby eating and drinking
establishments already having had negative quality of life impacts for residents, the Applicant
agreeing that they would remove outdoor seating from their application and signing
stipulations agreeing to the same as part of meeting the public interest, yet the Applicant has
been operating in derogation of those stipulations with tables and chairs on the sidewalk above
their premises and has constructed an additional roadbed café which they are also operating
in derogation of those same stipulations; and
vii. Whereas, the immediate residential neighborhood is currently saturated with licensed
premises with 65 active licenses listed on LAMP within 750 feet of the instant application
and 8 pending licenses; the SLA Committee recommending denial of the expansion of the
premises on this residential block unless the Applicant agreed to not having outdoor seating
in the future where it had never previously been permitted, the agreement made with the
community at the time of the initial application in June/2022 in order to meet the requirements
for public interest, convenience or advantage was that there would be no outdoor seating, with
the only complaints being made by local residents since they opened and continuing now
being about patrons behavior outside the premises; as this alteration application was only for
expansion of the interior premises and did not have any outdoor seating as part of the instant
application, the Committee reconsidered their decision and recommended approval of the
alteration application if the Applicant agreed to sign the same stipulations as were originally
signed in June/2022, the Applicant to date not agreeing to sign those stipulations, instead
asking to have the increase in hours to 1 AM closing Sundays through Thursdays and 2 AM
closing Fridays and Saturdays that the board recommended denying in January/2024 and
which were not part of the notification to the Community Board for this instant application
and therefore not part of the public notice, nor was the discussion of a change in hours brought
up at any point during the Committee meeting, the Applicant’s Attorney stating the Applicant
is fine with all the other stipulations, it being pointed out to the Attorney that the stipulations
are the same as what is currently in place and that nothing precludes the Applicant from filing
a Change in Method of Operation and returning for the extension of hours; and
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that CB2, Man. recommends denial of the Alteration
Application for Iaccas Corp dba Old Fashion Cafe 110 Thompson 10012; and
30THEREFORE BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that should this application be considered by
the NYSLA, CB2, Man. respectfully requests that this item be calendared to appear before the Full
Board of the NYSLA before any Alteration or Change in Method of Operation to the existing On-
Premises Liquor License (Lic ID #0340-23-136034, legacy SN #1348100, exp 3/31/2025) is issued
to this Applicant; and
THEREFORE, BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that if despite CB2, Man.’s objections to this
Application, should the NYSLA not find good cause to deny this Alteration Application, CB2
Man. recommends in the alternative that the following stipulations remain on the On-Premises
Liquor License for Iaccas Corp dba Old Fashion Cafe 110 Thompson St 10012:
1. Premises will be advertised and operated as café and bistro with the kitchen open and full

Governor of New York State

Dear Hon. Governor Hochul and Members of the MTA Board of Directors:
We, the undersigned Community Boards that make up Manhattan’s Central Business District (“CBD”),
are writing in response to Governor Hochul’s abrupt and unilateral decision to indefinitely suspend the
implementation of the CBD Tolling program (“Congestion Pricing”), originally scheduled for June 30.
The stakes could not be higher: 900,000 vehicles enter the CBD daily, resulting in heavy congestion
that contributes to higher levels of air and noise pollution, adversely affects public health, increases
emergency response times, diminishes overall quality of life for residents and car and bus commuters,
and incurs hundreds of millions in productivity losses annually (see Exhibit A).
NYC’s transit infrastructure is in dire need of modernization and expansion, yet faces significant
funding shortfalls. To meet transit needs, temporary state funds and piecemeal financial measures are
unreliable and insufficient, often subject to political fluctuations and economic constraints. Without adedicated revenue source, the MTA struggles to maintain existing infrastructure and fund necessary
improvements, leading to potential service cuts, fare increases, and further deterioration of the transit
system. The vast majority of workers commuting to the CBD rely upon public transit.
Congestion Pricing is the culmination of decades of planning and legislative action dedicated to
reducing the severe traffic congestion in Manhattan's CBD, improving air quality, reducing GHG
emissions, and securing a critical source of funding for the MTA. Previous experience with projects
that have been put on hold (e.g., Access to the Region's Core) illustrate that such delays greatly
exacerbate the deteriorated conditions meant to be addressed - and that when those projects are
eventually resumed, they're faced with much heavier damage and exorbitantly higher costs.
Furthermore, the CBD Tolling Program is New York State law – a unilateral “pause” with no plan
for its implementation or how to address the financial hole resulting from this decision is poor
governance, undermines the rule of law, and diminishes the citizenry’s confidence in the State and
MTA’s ability to manage critical infrastructure projects and serve as reliable stewards of public funds.
Post-implementation, we fully expect that Congestion Pricing’s performance will be closely monitored
and the program refined to address any deficiencies or inequities that arise, such as potential impacts
on communities. However, after years of planning, hundreds of millions in investments, and
commitments made to the vast majority of New Yorkers, commuters, and visitors who will benefit
from this program, the decision to indefinitely suspend the program is unconscionable, and must
be immediately reversed.
Towards that end, we emphatically:
1. Urge Governor Hochul to adhere to existing state law and rescind her recent decision to direct the
MTA to indefinitely cease the implementation of Congestion Pricing and instead let it proceed;
2. Call upon the MTA Board and NYS DOT Commissioner to exercise their independence and
adhere to their fiduciary duty to ensure the long-term financial stability and improvement of New
York City’s transit system by voting for and/or ensuring implementation of Congestion Pricing
without delay;
3. Implore local, state, and federal officials to
• Work toward the immediate implementation of Congestion Pricing; and
• Oppose any alternative plan cobbled together haphazardly to make up the budget shortfall in an
unsustainable way.
Proposed alternatives - if any - must encompass not only the transit infrastructure funding
component, but also all the permanent and far reaching benefits of Congestion Pricing (e.g.,
improved traffic flow, better air quality and health, decrease in GHG emissions, more equitable transit,
increased street safety).Sincerely,

• Re SLA2, #2, 120 Leroy St., application for a rooftop bar with dining and paddle ball courts
o Committee voted unanimously to deny the application, but there is concern that
SLA Committee was also negotiating with the applicant on stipulations.
o Not appropriate to negotiate stipulations – this should be a straight denial. Hopes
that CB2 supports the denial.
Pete Davies
• Re: Landmarks: 550 Broadway - Legalization of Un-Permitted Exterior Signage
o Support for a proposed amendment to the draft resolution. At present, the resolution
is general because the applicant did not share a citation to the specific rule on which
the violation it received was based concerning the retail signage installed without
the requisite permit.
o The rule is Article 68, Section 2-13(D)(5). Citing the specific rule will yield a
stronger resolution.
Eleanor Wong
• Re: SLA application at 183 Grand Street (item 10 in SLA 1)
o Extending thanks for denial of liquor license at 183 Grand Street. Community wants
new businesses, but only good neighbors.

• Housing committee had its final meeting this week – voted on 80 bills, 16 of which passed
the Senate.
Office of NYS Assembly Deborah Glick, 66th District - Roy Ruiz reported:
• Met with DA's office on greater emphasis on prosecuting assaults by strangers.
• Questions / discussion
o Q: Is A-M Glick supporting Bill A8330 to lower the voting age to 16?
o A: Unsure – will follow up.
Office of NYS Assembly Member Grace Lee, 65th District - Jasper Scott reported:

• Upcoming event this Thursday in collaboration with MBP Levine to celebrate AAPI
Heritage Month on May 30th.

the location of public restrooms.
• AAPI Heritage Month event next Thursday, May 30th.
• The Borough President intervened regarding the Rent Guidelines Board’s proposal to hold
hearings on rent stabilized rate increases in every Borough except Manhattan – as a result
there will be a meeting in Manhattan on June 11th.
Council Member Erik Bottcher, 3rd District:
• Introduced legislation requiring the Department of Health to place social workers in NYPD
Police precincts. This is a critical missing piece in our efforts to support public safety and
would address the root cause of many issues precipitating engagement with law
enforcement.
• City of Yes for Housing Opportunity is one of the most important issues that the CB will
be considering. We are heading down a path in this City that is causing a crisis of
affordability. Population is rising, the amount of housing we are creating in NYC and in
surrounding metropolitan area is insufficient (e.g. there were on average over 9000
applications for each new affordable apartments last year). CM Bottcher's district
generated the most housing between 2010 and 2020 – more than any other area in the City
(the vast majority of which was located in CB4). Proposal will increase density around
subway stations and create walkable neighborhoods in the Outer Buildings. Will allow
commercial corridors in the outer boroughs to be built up to create housing. This legislation
is essential to sustainable growth.
• Questions / discussion
o Question on funding and support for social workers. C-M recognizes the
importance of pay in attracting and retaining social workers. Has also been
supportive of removing an entrance exam that has limited the pool.
o Invitation to C-M to join an Act Up event in protest. Mayor is proposing $5 million
budget cuts to HIV care. C-M will try to join
Christopher Marte, NYC Council Member, 1st District:
• City of Yes for Economic Opportunity was passed by the City Council.
• CM Marte recommended 23 amendments to City of Yes for Economic Opportunity. 21
amendments were placed in the text. These recommendations included the following:
o Ensuring that there is not an unlimited use of commercial spaces in NYCHA
buildings. Businesses in these spaces must be beneficial to residents.
5o Limiting the use of home office space to 1 individual, down from the initial
proposal of 3-5. The amount of space in a home that can be used is down to
50%.
o Adjustments to nightlife venues so they do not impinge on residential uses.
o Updates on Cannabis growth spaces. Restricting types of spaces that can be
used to grow cannabis in otherwise residential buildings.
o Huge adjustments to last mile distributions and warehouses.
• Ongoing fights and oversight hearings around the budget and proposed cuts.
• Questions / discussion:
o Question on C-M Marte's stance of City of Yes for Housing Opportunity.
§ Cons: Already have voluntary inclusionary housing. It is underutilized.
Does not anticipate the provisions proposed in COYHO to be different.
§ District has seen the most production of residential units, many
converted. None of them were affordable.
§ Pros: Legalizing basement dwellings, allowing homeowners to increase
units, and Town Center proposals are all good policy.
o How does the CM define ""affordable housing?"" City looks at AMI. C-M Marte
thinks that affordability should be adjusted to the income level in the
neighborhood in question.
o Clarifying question on businesses in NYCHA spaces.
o Question on the impact of late-night delivery services. C-M Marte to look into
this.
Office of Carlina Rivera, NYC Council Member, 2nd District - Katie Loeb reported:
• C-M Rivera is on maternity leave.
• A handful of items of legislation have been introduced:
• Community Opportunity to Purchase Act - allows non-profits and land trusts to buy back
buildings when they go on the market. While this bill does not contain a dedicated funding
stream, it would enable these organizations to have time to pull together the funding to
purchase the building
• Citywide gun buy-back program proposed.
• Fighting for restoration of funding for public libraries and arts and culture establishments.

STANDING COMMITTEE REPORTS WITH RESOLUTIONS
LANDMARKS AND PUBLIC AESTHETICS (First Meeting)
71.*155 Sullivan St. – Application is to legalize the installation of HVAC in front of a primary
facade, install moveable planters, relocate and replace statuary, pave courtyard, and install
signage.
Whereas:
A. St. Anthony of Padua is a parish church in SoHo of a Romanesque Revival style; and
B. The garden, along Houston Street on the north side of the church, was exposed when a tenement
that covered the secondary façade of the nave was taken down in the widening of Houston Street;
and
C. The current condition is asphalt paving, remnants of a destroyed shrine, and HVAC equipment
installed without a permit that is the subject of a violation; and
D. HVAC equipment is installed in the east end of garden area and the equipment is to be screened
by planters with evergreens to cure the violation: and
E. The replacement shrine to contain a statue of Our Lady of Fatima is raised on a 3.5’ pedestal,
and the base with the grotto is covered in stone in the style of customary grottos for statues of Our
Lady of Fatima; and
F. The applicant submitted pictures of traditional shrines to Our Lady of Fatima with closeups of
the stone, coursing and mortar that will be replicated in the base and canopy; and
G. In discussion with the applicant, it was agreed that the paving would be in stone related in
coursing, material, and mortar to the rusticated base of the north wall of the nave; and
H. The fence will be minimally reconfigured to provide ADA access to the garden; and
I. A relief of St. Anthony that is currently on a tower above the elevator entrance will be
repositioned to the south side of the tower and lettering saying “St. Anthony of Padua” in an
appropriate design will be added; and
J. The light fixture which provides light at the elevator entrance and illuminates the lettering and
relief will be replaced with a similar, more efficient fixture; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:
A. Approval of the planter with evergreens to mask the HVAC equipment; and
B. Approval of the shrine provided that it is covered in a natural stone that is in harmony with the
rusticated stone base of the north façade on the nave similar to the pictures of historic shrines
provided with the application; and
C. Approval of the paving of the garden provided that it is in a natural stone that is in harmony
with the rusticated stone base of the north facade of the nave; and
D. Approval of the modifications to the fence to provide ADA access to the garden; and
E. Approval of the relief, the lettering, and the lighting fixture on the tower.
8Vote: Unanimous, with 36 Board members in favor.
2. *512 Broadway – Application is to legalize the installation of signage without LPC permits.
Whereas:
A. There are two LED displays in the windows which were installed without LPC permits and the
applicant seeks to have them legalized; and
B. The screens are 64 square feet in a window area of 95 squad feet and place 21 inches behind
the window; and
C. The applicant represented that the images will be shown from 9:30 AM to 10:00 PM; and
D. The screens are capable of showing static images, slide shows, or moving images; and
E. The applicant represented that owing to the large size of the screens, and presumably because
they block interior views of the store, they are classified by LPC as “partitions” rather than
“window display screens”; and
F. The vast, bright images are inappropriate to the building and the historic district and project
considerable illumination beyond the window onto the sidewalk and street, rather than being
interior screens visible through the window; and
G. There is great concern that approval of these screens will set an unacceptable and regrettable
precedent for the threshold of the limits for large, illuminated screens in the historic district; and
H. Members of the community who live near the building spoke in opposition to the design and
amount of light emitted from the screens; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:
That the application for the large, bright LED display screens be denied and that any replacements
are considerably smaller, less bright, do not emit light into the street, and appear as screens behind
the windows rath than filling the window.
Vote: Unanimous, with 36 Board members in favor.
3. *550 Broadway – Application is to legalize exterior wall sign and double-faced banner
installed without LPC permits for ground floor tenant.
Whereas:
A. The sign and banner were installed without an LPC permit and the applicant seeks to have them
legalized; and
B. The sign is 10’10” wide and 18” high with brown raised halo lettering and logo 18” high; and
C. The sign is centered over the entrance to the store and its position, though not conforming
precisely to the sign band, compensates for the irregular configuration of the adaptation of the
bays to an assortment of stores; and
9D. The banner is 6’8” high and 46” wide with a brown logo; and
E. The applicant represented that that the banner and the pole extending from the building
conforms to LPC regulations for the building and the district; and
F. There was testimony from the public questioning the design of the sign; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:
A. Denial of the application for the banner over the store entrance because the banner far exceeds what is
stated in the Rules of LPC §2-13 (e)(11); and
B. Denial of the application for the sign over the store entrance because the sign is nearly twice the
allowable amount stated in the Rules of LPC §2-13 (d)(5).
Vote: Passed, with 35 Board members in favor, and 1 abstention (R. Kessler).
4. *70-74 Gansevoort St. – Application is to install new signage with lighting, modify
storefront infill, signage and modify the marquee roofing, add marquee lighting at
the Gansevoort St. and Washington St. facades.
Whereas:
A. The contemporary building in historic style is at a prominent corner site and is notable for the
two large historic style marquees; and
B. The infill will be reconfigured, with the existing system and have fewer entry doors and a larger
area of show windows respecting existing bays; and
C. There are interior security gates that are not visible when closed; and
D. A backlit logo sign: 3’11” high is adjacent to the entry door and there is modest signage on the
marquee and there are two 2’x3’ black fabric banner signs, one on each facade; and
E. The marquee signs have non illuminated individual 12” letters with sides matching the marquee
in color and the face white; and
F. There is modest lettering in the sign band on the Gansevoort Street facade; and
G. The marquees roofs are to be covered black sheet metal panels recessed into each section with
the result that the sidewalk will be in shadow owing to the large area of the marquees; and
H. The existing glass roof provides daylight to the sidewalk and gives a desirable light appearance
to the building; and
I. Security cameras and conduits for lights will be hidden in the structure of the roof; and
J. The lighting in the marquees consists of 81 1100 lumen lamps on Gansevoort Street and a
somewhat smaller number in a similar configuration on Washington Street; and
10K. The applicant represented that the system is to be controlled by a dimmer set at 25% to produce
a glowing effect with no explanation as to why the specification of lamps that are capable of being
four times brighter than the maximum intended; and
L. The amount of illumination that can be produced by the total number of lamps concentrated in
two locations has the potential to overtake the corner and the block by flooding the sidewalk and
the general area with unacceptable levels of illumination and act as a beacon from afar; and
M. In that the programming of the lighting installation cannot be regulated or monitored, it is
essential that any installation itself provide surety that the level of light is modest and in keeping
with the building and the district; and
N. The applicant asserted that the canopy is of modern design when it is evident that it is in a
somewhat modified historical design as shown in numerous examples of historic marquees
presented by the applicant; and
O. The historic design of the marquee would be complemented by lighting that recalls a historic
design as illustrated in the jelly jar fixtures in a photograph shown by the applicant as precedent;
now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:
A. Approval of the modifications to the infill, the security gates, the illuminated entry sign, the
marquee and banner signs, and the security cameras; and
B. That the installation of the metal roof of the marquee be denied and that the glass covering of
the marquee be left in place; and
C. That the installation of the contemporary excessive globe lighting be denied and that the
lighting be a modest number of lights with historical reference with respect to the design of the
fixtures and the quality of light.
Vote: Unanimous, with 36 Board members in favor.
LANDMARKS AND PUBLIC AESTHETICS (Second Meeting)
5. *44 West 8th St. – Application is to demolish the existing building and construct a new 5-
story and penthouse building.
Whereas:
A. The existing one-story building from 1956, replacing a tenement building and a stable on the
site, is of no historic merit and there will be no loss to the historic district by its being demolished;
and
B. The proposed 25’ wide building is five stories in brick and terra cotta with a one-story
penthouse, with contemporary entrances and storefronts, double hung punched windows and a
setback penthouse with French doors; and
11C. The design is intended to be harmonious with the varying heights and designs of buildings in
the block and certain elements the recall the tenement and stable buildings on the site; and
D. The ground floor is light terra cotta with recessed plate glass windows with 8” bulkheads which
give an overly modern show window appearance to an otherwise modest design; and
E. A blade sign at the retail entrance and the transom lettering are intended to be place holders and
any future signage will be considered by Commission staff or a public meeting; and
F. The upper floors are in modern red brick which, rather than the 21” long Roman brick proposed,
would better reflect the historic inspiration for the design if built in a brick of a more traditional
proportion; and
G. The simulated double hung windows are recessed approximately 16” with stepped brick
framing and the stepped pattern is repeated in the rather prominent cornice; and
H. The recessed penthouse is in terra cotta, with bulkheads and mechanicals clad in unpainted
standing seam metal; and
I. Visibility studies show that there are no objectionable views of the penthouse and mechanical
equipment from any public thoroughfare though there is some visibility from a distance near Sixth
Avenue; and
J. The required aluminum safety railing on the roof of the penthouse is not objectionable; and
K. The ground floor rear is built to near the property line on the existing foundation with a terrace
at the second floor and French doors with double hung windows on the upper floors; and

disturb the neighbors; and
M. Members of the public spoke about details of the design and requested in particular that care
be taken with any lighting on the roof terrace so that it does not disturb the neighbors; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:

reviewed by the Landmarks Commission staff or at a CB2 public hearing; and

OUTDOOR DINING
Application to DOT for a Sidewalk Cafe:
1. Maneken Corp. dba Oscar’s Place, 466 Hudson Street, 10014 with 6 tables and 12
chairs (Dining Out NYC – Sidewalk Cafe)
Whereas, the comments related to the sidewalk cafe setup’s physical footprint and dimensions
are as follows:
• The applicant operated a sidewalk cafe in the pre-pandemic sidewalk cafe program from
1998 – 2020 as administered by the Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA), now known
as the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP);
• The proposed site plan mirrors the site plan used by the establishment in the pre-
pandemic sidewalk cafe plan which adheres to the Dining Out NYC rules;
• The applicant confirmed that there will be three tables and six chairs in the roadway cafe
as outlined on the site plan;
• The applicant has an executed stipulations agreement with CB2 and the State Liquor
Authority (SLA);
Whereas, the comments related to pedestrian flow are as follows:
• The establishment is located on a Regional Corridor (Hudson Street between Grove
Street and Morton Street) and the site plan presented clearly outlines the 10-foot clear
path, a requirement for the corridor category;
Whereas, the comments related to potential conflicts with existing curb use (i.e. planters,
bike racks, bus stops) are as follows:
• No potential conflicts with existing curb use were identified;
Therefore Be It Resolved, Manhattan CB2 recommends approval of the Dining Out NYC
sidewalk cafe for Maneken Corp. dba Oscar’s Place, 466 Hudson Street, 10014 because the
applicant’s proposed site plan and application form as referred by DOT are accurate and
complete.
Vote: Unanimous, with 36 Board members in favor.
Application to DOT for a Roadway Cafe:
132. West10West LLC dba West10West, 242 West 10th Street 10014 with three tables and
six chairs (Dining Out NYC – Roadway Cafe)
Whereas, the comments related to the roadway cafe setup’s physical footprint and
dimensions:
• West 10th Street, a narrow residential street, between Hudson Street and Bleecker Street,
where this establishment is located has many concurrent important neighborhood uses
where safety is a factor including the MTA M8 bus route, an official NYC DOT Shared
bike lane, the primary entrance for the NYPD 6th Precinct station and NYPD Bomb
Squad and service vehicle entrance located just east of the establishment on the north side
of the street. In addition, FDNY ambulances regularly respond to emergency calls at the
precinct and park quickly in front of the precinct which results in an even further reduced
roadway travel lane;
• The proposed roadway cafe is 12.4 feet long by 7 feet wide;
• The northern parking lane across the street from the proposed roadway dining setup is
demarcated by a white line that runs along the north side of 10th Street between Hudson
Street and Bleecker Street that separates the parking lane from the vehicle lane; this white
line marks the edge of the roadway travel lane on the north side;
• DOT indicated at a public presentation on the Dining Out NYC rules on April 3, 2024
that the 15-foot emergency lane would be measured from the white parking line;
• The measurement from the white parking line on the north side of West 10th Street to the
sidewalk curb face on the south side without the proposed roadway dining setup is 16
feet, 6 7/8 inches;
• If the roadway proposed roadway cafe has a width of 7 feet, that leaves a 9-foot, 6 7/8-
inch emergency lane, which does not meet the requirement for the 15-foot emergency
lane as stated in the Dining Out NYC rules;
• The required 15-foot emergency lane is not indicated on the proposed site plan for
this roadway cafe. DOT did not advise the applicant or CB2 if this application for a
roadway cafe was granted a waiver for the 15-foot emergency lane;
• This omission to include the emergency travel lane in the proposed plans for pre review
by DOT is a disservice to the applicant who has paid an application fee in order to go
through the Dining Out NYC application process, which has resulted in an application
referred to the board that was not correct and accurate or even seemingly plausible given
14the unique uses of the roadway on this block including the MTA bus route, bike lane and
NYPD uses.
Whereas, the comments related to pedestrian flow are as follows:
• The establishment is located on a Neighborhood Corridor (West 10th Street between
Hudson Street and Bleecker Street) which requires an 8-foot clear path on the sidewalk;
• There is also a proposed sidewalk dining setup at this same location with very tight
clearances and it is imperative that any wait staff service to either the roadway cafe setup
and sidewalk cafe setup up occur entirely within each so as not to impede the required 8-
foot clear path.
Whereas, the comments related to potential conflicts with existing curb use (i.e. planters,
bike racks, bus stops) are as follows:
• The application form is not complete and accurate as confirmed by the applicant who
appeared on Zoom;
• The applicant confirmed verbally that as noted on the site plan, they will remove the
seating that is built around the tree pit, which is located in the furnishing zone, in order to
be in compliance with the Dining Out NYC rules;
• Please also refer to comments pertaining to the roadway cafe setup’s physical footprint
and dimensions (listed in the first box above) which outline the concurrent roadway uses
unique to this location and block;
Whereas, the overall recommendation for the roadway cafe setup is:
• Recommend that the 15-foot emergency lane requirement be maintained on this
block given the MTA Bus Route, DOT Shared Bike Lane, NYPD Precinct and Bomb
Squad located on the block and that no waiver be issued;
• Recommend the applicant remove the seating around the tree pit;
• Recommend DOT advise both the applicant and CB2 whether or not a waiver has been
applied for or issued regarding the required 15-foot emergency lane;
• Recommend that if there is a roadway cafe setup approved, that there is sufficient room
for all wait staff service to the tables in the roadway dining café from within the footprint
so that there is no encroachment on the required 8-foot clear path on the sidewalk; this is
especially important given the narrow sidewalk which also has a proposed sidewalk
dining setup.
15Whereas, the suggested modifications for the roadway cafe setup are:
• Recommend that the applicant update the incomplete application form and resubmit it to
DOT in order to:
o Confirm that the furnishings shown on the site plan are lightweight and easily
removable;
o Indicate if they will be using umbrellas or any vertical screening elements;
o Confirm that the applicant remove the seating around the tree pit.
Therefore Be It Resolved, Manhattan CB2 recommends submitting the comments as
stated above to DOT regarding the Dining Out NYC roadway cafe for West10West LLC
dba West10West, 242 West 10th Street, 10014.

fundamental democratic process upon which the United States was founded; and

aliens, according to the census or enumeration used as the population basis for the
formation of such districts”, and that, the term ""inhabitants, excluding aliens"" shall mean
the whole number of persons.”; and
9. Whereas, 16 and 17-year-olds are counted in the determination of New York legislative
districts which are drawn based on total population, not age, voter eligibility, or
registration; and
10. Whereas, without the right to vote 16 and 17-year-olds are excluded from having a voice
in decisions that directly impact their everyday lives and futures, such as education policy
and how their tax dollars are spent; and
11. Whereas, the proposed legislation includes targeted seminars “in civics [which] will not
only respect the right to self-determination of this age group but will greatly encourage
youth turnout and engagement""; and
12. Whereas, across the globe, 16 and 17-year-olds have demonstrated readiness for civic
engagement through advocacy for issues that they care about from gun safety to the climate
crisis8; and

turnout among this age group14; The Tacoma, MD example is also a super powerful local
and US-based one15; and
21. Whereas, studies have shown that voting is habit forming16, so beginning voting when
individuals are cognitively capable of doing so, which studies of brain development show
occurs by age 16, can improve these individuals’ turn out later in life17 18; and
22. Whereas, introducing civics at an earlier age will create better voting habits. According
to an article in the Rutgers Law Review, research indicates that lowering the voting age to
sixteen increases voting participation among youth and establishes long-term habits of
electoral engagement.19 By allowing 16 and 17-year-olds to vote, we can instill a sense of
civic responsibility and empowerment from an early age, strengthening our democracy in
the long run; and
23. Whereas, lowering the voting age to 16 acknowledges the significant contributions of 16
and 17-year-olds as active members of society and affirms their stake in the future of their
communities and beyond; and now
Therefore Be It Resolved, Community Board 2 calls on the New York State Legislature to pass,
and New York State voters to approve, S.2562/A.330, which would amend the State Constitution
to lower the voting age for state and local elections to 16.

R. Chattree, V. De La Rosa, C. Flynn, L. Rakoff, R. Sanz, E. Siegel, F. Sigel, C. Spence); 2
Abstentions (A. Diaz, S. Kent).
The board participated in lively discussion on this resolution and the merits of lowering the voting
age in state and local elections. The board expressed mixed perspectives on the resolution itself,
but overall support for increasing voter turnout and enfranchisement more broadly.

2. 609 Padel, LLC and Mogador Greenwich LLC, 120 Leroy St (OP–Restaurant Liquor On
Premise and Restaurant Wine On Premise for a Private Members Club with Rooftop Bar and
Paddle Board Courts) (previously unlicensed location)
i. Whereas, the Applicant and the Applicant’s Attorney appeared before Community Board 2,
Manhattan’s SLA Licensing Committee to present an application for a new On-Premises
Restaurant Liquor License to operate a private members club with a restaurant, rooftop bar,
42spa facilities and paddle courts located on the 9th floor and rooftop of a nine-story commercial
building (c. 1920) on Leroy Street between Hudson and Greenwich Streets; and
ii. Whereas, the Applicant seeks to operate on the ninth-floor interior (13,020 sq.ft.) and rooftop
(13,020 sq. ft.) as a private membership club in a previously unlicensed location, the hours of
operation will be from 7 AM to 12 AM daily on both the 9th floor and the rooftop, music is
background only, there will be no speakers or music on the rooftop, there may be 20 private
events/year at which time a DJ may be used but at no time will the DJ or any music be on the
roof; and
iii. Whereas, entry to the private members club, 9th floor restaurant and rooftop paddle courts
and dining is located on Leroy Street via a dedicated street entrance for the members
club/restaurant and patrons leading to a dedicated elevator exclusively used as the primary
entrance for members and patrons to access the private members club on the 9th floor and
rooftop; the 9th floor consists of a gym, women’s and men’s locker rooms and spa facilities
which are only open to members of the private club, there is a restaurant with 18 tables and
72 seats and three (3) bathrooms; the rooftop, accessed via the elevator or an internal stairway,
consists of three (3) paddle courts which are enclosed with some form of canvas, an
unenclosed dining area and rooftop common space consisting of one (1) bar with five (5) seats
and 15 low tables with approximately 46 seats; there being no Certificate of Occupancy
provided for either the proposed use or occupancy limits for eating and drinking, the applicant
and their counsel not providing any guidance or limitations as to whether patrons would be
seated or standing for the purpose of the service of alcohol or if the occupancy and use is
permitted, and
iv. Whereas, only the eating and drinking areas of the private members club on the 9th floor and
rooftop will be open to the public via a daily fee, access to the spa facilities and rooftop paddle
courts are for members of the private club only; there will be a $50 fee for the public to gain
access to the eating and drinking areas on the rooftop before 5 PM but there will be no fee
after 5 PM; and
v. Whereas, the Applicant stating that the large rooftop paddle courts (which part of the private
members club but are not part of the licensed premises) that operate from 7 AM to 12 AM
will be covered in canvas of some sort but provided no specific plans as to materials or any
sound study indicating soundproofing ability from paddle ball, there will be lighting, heating
and cooling in the paddle court area but no plans were provided regarding how that might
impact surrounding residents, there were also no specifics on any type of safety or sound
barrier along the rooftop, there being many residential buildings surrounding the premises
including those across the street both on Leroy and Greenwich Streets in addition to the large
condominium building known as the Printing House at 421 Hudson Street that is to the East
with bedrooms and living quarters of residential apartments located on the top floors; and
vi. Whereas, many directly impacted residents living within a block of the premises spoke in
strong opposition to the application stating there had been no outreach or postings by the
Applicant, many of these buildings having co-op/condo boards that could have been reached
43out to, the residents finding out about the application through CB2 flyer posting in the area;
many residents have young children whose bedrooms face out to the paddle courts and rooftop
dining, concerns were raised about the sound coming from both patrons in the eating and
drinking portion of the rooftop and the courts early in the morning and late into the evening,
there being no sound study provided to illustrate how the sound from rooftop eating and
drinking areas or paddle courts will be contained, there was opposition to the rooftop bar and
lounge seating due to quality of life concerns regarding noise from patrons drinking on the
rooftop until midnight every night, there being a bar on the roof with all the surrounding
seating being low, lounge-style chairs and couches with no kitchen or prep area, the dining
component not being that of a seated restaurant but more of a lounge, as there was no
Certificate of Occupancy presented and there is ample room for standing on the rooftop the
occupancy / number of patrons including standing patrons is unknown, the rooftop being
significant in size, never previously licensed for the service of alcohol and the entire rooftop
will ultimately be licensed for the service of alcohol for this Applicant and others that will
inevitably come after it; residents saying that Greenwich Street is a quiet reprieve from
Hudson Street, while a number of residents who spoke have lived in the immediate area for
many years, there are also a number of newer residential buildings that are impacted by the
rooftop activities, residents also questioned any public interest of having another restaurant in
the area with rooftop activities that will create quality of life disturbances and offer nothing
unique to the residents and not accessible to non-members without paying a daily fee in
addition to any other costs, there are already a significant number of licensed establishments
in the area that have worked to build trust with their neighbors; there also being concerns
raised with respect to vehicular traffic and parking in the area; and
vii. Whereas, a land use attorney representing a resident living directly across the street and
immediately exposed to the proposed rooftop bar also spoke to raise serious questions as to
whether the proposed rooftop use is allowed at all per zoning, the building being located in
an M1-5 district that requires all commercial activities to be located within completely
enclosed buildings (See ZR Section 42-411). He raised questions that if the three paddle courts
were enclosed they may constitute new zoning floor area. Additionally, the attorney cited a
recent DOB Buildings Bulletin (BB 2018-002) that indicates that outdoor table service may
be allowed in certain situations, provided that kitchens, food preparation areas, cooking areas,
wait stations, and bar areas must be inside the associated eating and drinking establishment,
the unenclosed rooftop bar being in violation of that restriction and the unenclosed paddle
courts not being permitted under any circumstances; and
viii. Whereas, while the Applicant’s attorney asserted that he did not believe this application was
subject to the 500 Foot Rule, claiming the vertical distance from street level up to the rooftop
should be added for purpose of measurement despite the impacts addressed by portions of the
500 ft rule not being diminished by vertical height, undermining the premises of the 500 ft
law established in 1993, he provided no legal precedent, guidance or declaratory ruling
supporting such an assertion, not withstanding that the ground floor door leads to the elevator
which is used exclusively by the Applicant as the primary doorway and ingress for all
members and patrons, this rooftop being surrounded by impacted residences, including those
44on the same level or higher than the rooftop sought to be licensed, there being no valid
reasoning to assume or conclude that the public interest standard should not apply here, a rule
that requires the Applicant to demonstrate that the public interest would be served by the
addition of another liquor license on this particular rooftop, the surrounding area and existing
community already containing a significant number of licensed eating/drinking
establishments, there being 9 active licensed premises within 500 feet of the premises and 44
active licenses within 1000 feet of this particular location, in addition to 10 pending licenses,
according to LAMP, including OSSEA LLC, at 39 CLARKSON STREET, another
application seeking the service of alcohol on an adjacent rooftop to the instant application, the
instant application with rooftop bar not satisfying the public interest standard; and
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that Community Board 2, Manhattan recommends denial of
the applications for a new On-Premises Restaurant Liquor and Restaurant Wine License for 609
Padel, LLC and Mogador Greenwich LLC, 120 Leroy St; and
THEREFORE BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that should this application be considered by
the NYSLA, CB2, Manhattan respectfully requests that this item be calendared to appear before
the Full Board of the NYSLA
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that because the Covid emergency has long passed, CB2
requests that the SLA conduct an in person or video conference 500-foot hearing so that
members of the public, their representatives and CB2 can address issues and answer questions
so that facts on which any recommendations are based are accurate and clear and responses to
any statements are able to be made prior to any recommendation.

#2 to present an application for a new On-Premises Liquor License to operate a full-service

of other Keg & Lantern establishments in Brooklyn on the ground floor of a seven (7)-story
mixed-use building (c.1910) on 7th Avenue South between Morton, Bedford and Leroy Streets
(Block #586/Lot #45); and

in front of the premises proposed to be licensed with not more than 18 tables and 36 seats
until 10 PM every night, there will be no roadbed seating, the number of tables and chairs and
seating diagram conforming to what had been approved under the DCWP program for the
previous licensee at the premises, that licensee being International Hospitality Concepts LLC
dba La Loteria (Lic ID 0340-22-104522, SN# 1281745) which operated as a full-service
restaurant from approximately 2015–2023; and
v. Whereas, there were significant concerns raised by both members of the local block
associations, including Morton Street Block Association, and the surrounding residents about
the application as submitted to CB2, Man., the submitted application including closing hours
of 2 AM Sunday through Thursday and 4 AM Fridays and Saturdays, those hours being
inconsistent with the other neighborhood restaurants and more in alignment with the existing
late night bars within 400' of the premises (C7 Ave South LLC dba Judy Z’s, Lic ID 0340-
23-137321 operating as a sports bar until 2AM; Den NoHo LLC dba Bandits, Lic ID 0340-
23-139295 closing at 2 AM and 4 AM; and Elmhurst 3 Inc dba The Village Tavern, Lic ID
0340-23-128086 closing at 4 AM) with patrons leaving late into the evening creating
significant quality of life issues for residents of Bedford St., Morton St. and St. Luke’s Place;
the instant application having hours more in line with a bar than a restaurant; there were also
concerns that the premises would operate as a sports bar as opposed to a restaurant, the social
media posts from the other Keg and Lantern outposts showing sports programming being
viewed on large TV screens and advertised bottomless brunches with the instant application
including three television, one of which being a large projector TV; local residents saying that
they would welcome a true full service restaurant similar to La Loteria in method of operation,
with a focus on food as opposed to sports and drinking; and
vi. Whereas, the Applicant, appearing somewhat unaware of the issues the surrounding late night
bars caused with the residents, upon hearing the concerns of the residents agreed to adjust
their hours to be more in alignment with, though still somewhat later than, other nearby
restaurants, those hours being Sundays through Thursdays from 11 AM to 12 AM and Fridays
and Saturdays from 11 AM to 1 AM, the overly large projector TV was removed from the
application and the remaining two televisions will operate in “closed caption” mode only; and
vii. Whereas, the Applicant has executed and has had notarized a Stipulations Agreement with
Community Board 2, Manhattan which will be incorporated into the “Method of Operation”
of the On Premise Restaurant Liquor License, with those stipulations as follows:

Vote: Unanimous, 36 Board Members in favor.
4. West10West LLC dba West10West 242 W 10th St 10014 (RW–Restaurant) (Alteration)
i. Whereas, the manager, not one of the Principals, appeared before Community Board 2,
Manhattan’s SLA Committee #2 to present an application to the NYS Liquor Authority for
an alteration to their existing Restaurant Wine License (Lic ID #0240-23-164923, SN
#6007319, exp. 11/30/25) to add sidewalk and roadbed seating to the licensed premises; and
ii. Whereas, the ground floor storefront is roughly 450 sq. ft. with 7 tables with 16 patron seats
and one (1) bar with eight (8) seats for a total interior patron seated occupancy of 24 persons,
there is no basement, the storefront infill being fixed without French doors or operable
windows, there is one patron entrance serving as both patron ingress and egress and one patron
bathroom; and
iii. Whereas, the current hours of operation as agreed to in the December/2022 stipulation
agreement with CB2, Man. are 8 AM to 10 PM Sundays through Wednesdays, 8 AM to
11 PM Thursdays and 8 AM to 12 AM Fridays and Saturdays, interior music being at
background levels only, with no dancing, TVs, DJs, no promoted events, no scheduled
performances or cover fees, no security and no sidewalk or roadbed seating operating under
the temporary Open Restaurants program; and
iv. Whereas, the instant application is to add a sidewalk café with 2 tables and 4 seats and
roadway seating of 3 tables and 6 seats with closing hours of 11 PM Sundays through
Saturdays (7 days a week) despite the hours of operation on the stipulation agreement with
CB2, Man and attached to their liquor license are closing at 10 PM Sundays through
Wednesdays; and
v. Whereas, the Applicant (one of the Principals) first appeared at CB2, Manhattan in
December/2022 to present the Restaurant Wine application stating he would operate a
“daytime café offering take away service as well as a menu for seated breakfast/lunch until
3 PM, dining service will reopen at 5 PM for seated dinner, offering beer and wine with
meals,” at the time the Applicant requesting hours of 8 AM to 10 PM Sundays through
Wednesdays and 8 AM to 12 AM Thursdays through Saturdays; after meeting with the local
block association (West Village Residents Association) and in order to gain their support for
the service of beer, wine and cider on a narrow residential block in an area already saturated
with licensed premises, the Applicant agreed to a compromise of closing at 11 PM on
Thursdays, along with other stipulations which included that there would be no roadbed dining
or sidewalk café either in front of or adjacent to the premises, with a significant reason the
48block association was giving their support of the application in this saturated area being due
to the emphasis on breakfast and lunch service in conjunction with early dinner hours and
absolutely no outdoor seating; and
v. Whereas, despite executing a stipulation agreement with CB2, Man. and having as a method
of operation on the liquor license that there would be no outdoor areas and the hours of
operation would be closing at 10 PM Sundays through Wednesdays, the Applicant used the
enclosed wooden shed located in the roadway outside their premises and the neighboring tea
shop on West 10th Street, the neighboring tea shop being operated by one of the Principals of
the instant application, and advertised closing hours past 10 PM on Sundays through
Wednesdays; and
vi. Whereas, the Applicant (one of the Principals) appeared again in January/2024 for an upgrade
to their Restaurant Wine license as well as to add sidewalk and roadbed seating to the licensed
premises at which time CB2, Man. recommended denial of the application for reasons
outlined in the January/2024 resolution including that the original application was for a
method of operation that served breakfast and lunch as a central component of the application
with closing hours no later than 10 PM Sundays through Wednesdays, the Applicant never
providing the much-needed breakfast or lunch service but instead opening late afternoon/early
evening and continuing to advertise and operate with service past 10 PM Sundays through
Wednesdays in derogation of their stipulations and liquor license; the roadbed shed that the
Principal says belongs to the neighboring tea shop, owned and operated by his partner,
remaining and being used in front of the restaurant premises; numerous nearby residents and
the local block association being opposed to both the upgrade to full liquor and the outdoor
seating; and
vii. Whereas, nearby residents and the local block association remain opposed to adding any
outdoor seating at this location, this being a residentially-zoned area where outdoor seating
was previously prohibited, the sidewalk being barely 12' wide and heavily trafficked with a
bus stop being located immediately to the west of the restaurant, it being unclear that the 8'
clear path could be maintained for pedestrian passage, there being residential entryways
immediately adjacent to the restaurant on both the east and west side requiring a 5' clearance,
the sidewalk congestion would be further exacerbated by the addition of the proposed roadbed
seating with patrons congregating as they enter and leave the roadbed and servers crossing
the pedestrian walkway as residents have already experienced being that the roadbed seating
currently exists, there is also a tree pit located adjacent to the roadbed structure which has had
seating built around it as the Applicant illustrated in the supplied diagram, further congesting
the sidewalk; the roadway itself is only 26' wide with a 9' parking lane on the north side in
addition to a bike lane, the proposed roadbed dining on the south side of the street being 7'
wide leaving approximately only 10' for emergency vehicles as opposed to the required 15'
emergency lane outlined in the Dining Out NYC program, there being no waiver issued for
exemption formt he 15 foot emergency lane; aside from a bike lane and the usual every day
traffic, the roadway is also a bus route with the bus stop located immediately to the west of
the roadbed so that buses are continuously pulling out into the roadway just before the roadbed
location and the through-block building housing the NYPD 6th Precinct police station and
49NYPD Bomb Squad is located mid-block, further adding to necessary clear vehicle travel on
the block; and
viii. Whereas, there is no Letter of No Objection permitting eating and drinking at the premises;
the Applicant stated at the time of the initial application in December/2022 that cooking would
be electric only, there would be no open flame cooking; there was a complaint made in
July/2023 regarding venting of the ground floor restaurant, with cooking smells going into
adjacent apartments and grease present on apartment windows and building shaft way, DOB
issuing a violation for work without a permit at the 1st floor restaurant “West 10 West”
(Oath/ECB Violation #39090615L), that violation remains open; and
ix. Whereas, the Applicant not presenting a method of operation serving breakfast, lunch and
dinner consistent with his Restaurant Wine application, the Applicant never actually operating
in the manner in which he presented his original application just a year and a half ago, the
Applicant continuing to advertise closing hours of 11 PM 7 days a week, the Applicant going
back on the commitments he made to the Community and local block association, the service
of alcohol to the exterior on a residential block having significant impacts on those living in
the area, the immediate location being residentially zoned, the surrounding area already being
heavily saturated with liquor licenses, the Applicant not obtaining the proper permits from the
NYC DOB for eating and drinking for the premises of the instant application; and
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that CB2, Man. recommends denial of the alteration
application to the Restaurant Wine License for West10West LLC dba West10West 242 W 10th
St 10014; and
THEREFORE BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that should this application be considered by
the NYSLA, CB2, Man. respectfully requests that this item be calendared to appear before the Full
Board of the NYSLA.

70TRAFFIC AND TRANSPORTATION
Resolution in Response to Request for Adjustment of Citi Bike Station at 95 Morton Street
on the north side of the block between Washington and Greenwich Streets.
Whereas Fanatics, Inc., a headquartered tenant of 95 Morton Street, employs roughly 450 people,
70% of whom are full-time employees, including individuals with disabilities necessitating front-
of-building drop-off; however, due to the presence of an 80-unit Citi Bike station in front of the
entrance, the nearest curbside drop-off is located at the end of Morton Street at the corner of
Washington; and
Whereas Fanatics plans to expand both its footprint and workforce, currently receiving
approximately 100 additional visitors per day between Tuesday and Thursday, yet the recently
installed Citi Bike station obstructs the front entrance to 95 Morton Street, causing congestion on
the sidewalk for employees and visitors; and
Whereas there are currently 80 Citi Bike stations in front of 95 Morton Street, and the request is
to remove 12 stations to accommodate ADA access, equivalent to 2 car lengths, thereby allowing
up to 4 cars to drop off passengers at 95 Morton; and
Whereas the NYC Dept. of Transportation (DOT) is not obligated to provide ADA access or
remove the recently installed Citi Bike stations in front of 95 Morton Street; and
Whereas the request aims to implement No Standing signage for pickup and drop-off purposes
only, replacing the 12 Citi Bike stations; and
Whereas Community Board 2 Manhattan (CB2) has previously requested additional Citi Bike
stations to accommodate Hudson River Park and the Greenway, aligning with resolutions passed
in January 2022, maintaining its support for the expansion of Citi Bike stations without
diminishing their number; and
Therefore be it resolved that CB2 recommends the removal of 12 Citi Bike stations from in front
of 95 Morton Street, suggesting Citi Bike and DOT reuse the stations in a nearby location,
preferably adjacent to Hudson River Park. Along with this, CB2 recommends implementing
parking restrictions in front of 95 Morton St., prohibiting standing from Monday to Friday, 8:00
a.m. to 6:00 p.m.
Vote: Unanimous, with 36 Board members in favor.
Resolution in response to a presentation by the NYC Dept. of Transportation (DOT) of plans
for bike lanes on Gansevoort St. (10th Ave. to Greenwich St.; Hudson St. to W. 13th St.) and
Horatio St. (West St. to Hudson St.).
Whereas Dan Wagner, from the newly created Public Realm division of the NYC Dept of
Transportation (DOT), presented plans for bike lanes on Gansevoort St. (10th Ave. to Greenwich
St.; Hudson St. to W. 13th St.) and Horatio St. (West St. to Hudson St.); and
71Whereas the roads within the area lie within the Meatpacking historic district, featuring
landmarked Belgian Block streets that do not provide safe, comfortable passage for cyclists; and
Whereas the plan entails installing granite paths along the area’s Belgian Block streets (9th Ave.
between Gansevoort St. to 14th St., 13th St. from Greenwich to Hudson, and Gansevoort St. from
Greenwich to Hudson) to offer a stable road passage for bicyclists, thereby connecting three granite
path streets along Gansevoort; and
Whereas additional conventional paths will be established on Gansevoort west of Washington and
Horatio St. from Greenwich to the parklet at the end of Horatio at the beginning of the street curve
leading to Jane St.; and
Whereas a ramp will be added to the curb at the southwestern edge of Gansevoort to allow
bicyclists to enter the parklet without having to jump the curb; and
Whereas the parklet, featuring benches around a small rotunda, is not conducive to congregation
due to its proximity to the heavily trafficked Hudson River Park and is not a relaxing place to sit
because it lies close to fast-moving vehicles alongside 9A; and
Whereas there is a roundabout in the center of the parklet, which will naturally slow cycle traffic,
and the ramp will encourage bicyclists to use it instead of the more heavily pedestrian-trafficked
north and south narrow sidewalk areas within the parklet that connect it to Horatio and Jane Sts.;
and
Whereas Community Board 2 Manhattan (CB2) has a history of requesting granite path bike lanes
on Belgian Block streets within CB2 in resolutions dating as far back as 2017 to establish granite
bike paths on Clarkson St. and Morton St., because delivery bikes and other cyclists coming from
America’s busiest Greenway (the Hudson River Park Greenway) use these streets as main entry
points to the east side of 9A, and these cyclists avoid riding on the Belgian Block streets (Clarkson
and Morton) in favor of the sidewalk, a habit that has a history of causing bodily injuries to
pedestrians including a broken leg injury a 10-year-old girl suffered due to a collision with a bike
riding on the sidewalk at Clarkson as she was returning home from soccer practice at downtown
Manhattan’s busiest soccer and baseball fields, Pier 40; and
Whereas the newly designed granite path has a lifespan of 20 to 50 years and should last on the
longer side of these terms because these areas are not as heavily trafficked by heavy vehicles as
other granite path areas such as 14th St.; and
Whereas the scope of the Public Realm’s projects is clearly defined and does not currently provide
enough resources to undergo larger capital projects such as creating an exit and entry point other
than the parklet;
Therefore be it resolved that CB2 endorses the Public Realm plan to extend the bicycle network
in the Meatpacking District with the following considerations:
• Cycle stamps should be used to clearly alert pedestrians in the parklet that they are on a shared
pathway with bicyclists, and signage should be placed to reinforce that cyclists must yield to
pedestrians; and
72• Pedestrians and bicyclists should be separated on the busy 9A crosswalks by clearly marking
pedestrian and bicyclist zones within the crosswalk, such as at the Gansevoort Street/9A crossing;
and
• It should be ensured that the bicycle path markings and the bicycle mini-ramp are clearly visible
to pedestrians and bicyclists alike; and
Be it further resolved that CB2 reiterates its longstanding requests for granite bicycle lanes on
Clarkson St. btw. West St. and Greenwich St. and on Morton St. btw. West St. and Washington
St.

STANDING COMMITTEE REPORTS WITH RESOLUTIONS
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
Opposition to the Closing of Mount Sinai Beth Israel Hospital
Whereas:
1) Mount Sinai Beth Israel (MSBI) notified Manhattan Community Boards 3 and 6 in
September of 2023 of its intention to close Beth Israel Hospital by July 12, 2024, but
6failed to notify Community Board 2, whose community members would be affected by
its closing; and
2) MSBI submitted to the New York State Department of Health on October 25, 2023, a
closure plan for Beth Israel Hospital1, which requires state approval, claiming financial
losses up to $150 million per year and lack of patient census; and
3) Since its 2013 merger with Continuum Care and subsequent takeover of Beth Israel,
Mount Sinai has moved or closed the following services from Beth Israel Hospital:
Obstetrics, Pediatrics, Neonatology, Orthopedics including: Back surgery, Join
replacement, General orthopedics, Hand surgery, Cardiac Surgery, Thoracic Surgery,
Neurosurgery, Weight loss/Obesity surgery, Gynecology, Head & Neck Surgery, ENT,
GI (advanced ERCP) while Interventional Radiology was downsized and Psychiatry was
moved/downsized – all of which suggests that the reduction of patient census and
accompanying loss of revenue may have been part of an overall strategy to close the
hospital over time; and
4) While MSBI cites new facilities it has opened in downtown Manhattan as a substitute for
those provided by Beth Israel Hospital, not all of these are equivalent: for example,
Rivington House provides behavioral health services but does not accept psychiatric
emergencies; Union Square and Mount Sinai’s Urgent Care facilities do not accept
emergencies and do not maintain round-the-clock hours; and
5) A letter to hospital administrators from the NYS DOH on August of 20232 specifies that
“it is the responsibility of the [closing] facility to ensure that communities and
community members continue to have access to needed health care services,” a policy
that presents a clear conflict of interest for the closing facility and raises concerns over
the state’s process for verifying MSBI’s claim that nearby facilities have the capacity to
absorb the displaced services and treatments; and
6) It is not clear how “access” will be determined if it is found that the closing of Beth Israel
is likely to result in longer wait times, crowded conditions, overburdened staffs, and
longer distances to alternate facilities; and
7) Closing Beth Israel Hospital would leave Manhattan without a full-service hospital
between New York-Presbyterian Lower Manhattan Hospital at 170 William Street and
Bellevue at 462 First Avenue (28th Street), St. Vincent’s Hospital having closed in 2010;
and
8) The closing of the Beth Israel Emergency Department would leave this large catchment
area without emergency services for stroke and heart attack victims for a temporary but
indefinite period of time until Lenox Health Greenwich Village is licensed and
designated to provide these services; and
9) The closing of the Beth Israel Emergency Department would leave this large catchment
area with a permanent gap in pediatric emergency services; and
10) The closing of the Beth Israel Emergency Department would permanently eliminate the
only facility in Manhattan below Bellevue Hospital that provides a Comprehensive

2 https://www.health.ny.gov/professionals/hospital_administrator/letters/2023/docs/dal_23-06.pdf
7Psychiatric Emergency Program (CPEP) at a time when serious mental illness has been
named a primary concern of the City and the State and this Community Board; and
11) Neither NYS DOH nor MSBI has provided documentation to assure this community that
it will have adequate access to healthcare if Beth Israel closes.
Therefore be it resolved that:
1) In the absence of answers to pressing questions about the impact that Beth Israel’s
closure would have on this community’s access to healthcare - especially general,
pediatric, and psychiatric emergency services - CB2 Manhattan strongly opposes the
closure plan of Mount Sinai Beth Israel and urges the NYS Department of Health to
reject the current application for closure and to conduct a rigorous audit of MSBI’s
claims; and
2) Given the temporary and permanent gaps in services that would be the result of closing
Beth Israel’s emergency department, CB2 Manhattan strongly opposes approval of its
closing unless and until adequate alternatives that are reasonably proximate to the CB2’s
District are identified.
Vote: Unanimous, 35 Board Members in favor.
LANDMARKS AND PUBLIC AESTHETICS
1. *530 Broadway – Application is to establish a master plan regarding painted artwork on the
northern secondary facade.
Whereas:
A. A number of murals in SoHo were made through the sponsorship of the City Walls program
and three remain as examples of the way in which murals can have a positive effect on the
neighborhood; and
B. There are existing Art Master Plans for SoHo buildings that have been approved by the
Commission; and
C. The applicant represented that the zoning regulations governing this building do not permit
advertising signs; and
D. The area of the sign is approximately the size of a now lost historic sign (65’ X 55’) and,
though larger than what the rules governing master plans for advertising signage would allow,
the proposed painted artwork respects certain of the same regulations regarding setback and
window clearance; and
E. The duration of the permit is to be for ten years with rotation approximately each year; and
F. The selection of the artists is to be by the building owner in consultation with experts; and
8G. There were comments favoring the application from the Public; now
Therefore, be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends approval of the permit for painted wall
art provided that there is no advertising, no illumination and no dimensional elements.
Vote: Unanimous, 35 Board Members in favor.
2. *299 W. 12th St. - Application is to modify a window on the upper level and add an
additional window on the lower level of the south facade of a penthouse.
Whereas:
A. The Bing and Bing building is a prominent historic building set in a particularly important
and visible location at the north end of Abingdon Square; and
B. The two stories of the penthouse facade original fenestration layout was somewhat irregular
as illustrated by historic photographs; and
C. The proposed windows match the existing windows and the irregularity in the placement is
indistinguishable from the irregularity of the existing historic placement for the penthouses; now
Therefore, be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends approval of the window modifications as
they are respectful of the historic building.
Vote: Unanimous, 35 Board Members in favor.
3. *477 W. Broadway – Application is to construct an open structure for year-round dining over
the existing patio.
Whereas:
A. The open space is a small residual private lot, of a kind common along the south side of
Houston Street, resulting from the widening of the street in connection with the building of a
subway line; and
B. The plot is presently used for outdoor dining and is proposed to be fitted with a structure that
was represented by the applicant as an enclosure that can provide shelter and comfort for year-
round dining without being a conventional building; and
C. The structure is 10’ high in a stark modern design in dark bronze painted aluminum with a
glass louver ceiling with glass doors and gives a heavy, permanent appearance; and
D. The appearance of a “building” rather than a “shed” is at odds with the applicant’s
referencing the historic photograph presentation of improvised areas for trade historically
occupying such lots along the street; and
9E. The design has no historic reference to the neighborhood, nor does it evoke the feeling of an
enclosed sidewalk cafe; and
F. The west end of the structure has glass doors with operable louver windows on either side
that appear to be an entrance to a regular building; and
G. The existing 6’6” high fence is to remain and to be painted black and covered in artificial
greenery; and
H. The structural elements are heaver in appearance than would plausibly be required for such a
structure, and their being painted a dark color in combination with the covering of the black
fence with artificial greenery add to the feeling of a heavy, enclosed building; and
I. There was testimony from the public opposed to the building; now
Therefore, be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends denial of the application as being a
modern building without historic reference rather than a light structure that preserves the spirit of
outdoor dining and has a historic reference to the neighborhood.
Vote: Unanimous, 35 Board Members in favor.
4. *230 W. 11th St. – Application is to construct a new roof and bulkheads (stair) install
HVAC, construct a new sub-cellar, cellar extension, install new rear façade wall and windows,
and rebuild existing 2-story rear addition.
Whereas:
A. There is to be restoration for the front facade and entrance which is approved by the
Commission staff; and
B. The new stair bulkhead and mechanical screening are in dark standing seam metal and are
minimally visible; and
C. The chimney extension for clearance of the new bulkhead and the required fence at the front
of the roof are usual for the neighborhood; and
D. The existing rear extension with random fenestration is to be demolished at the basement,
parlor and second floor; and
E. A new extension is in line with the extensions on the two buildings to the east and preserves
the unusually open doughnut adjacent to a large garden area; and
F. The extension matches existing brick, and has French doors in three punched openings at the
basement, parlor and second floor; and
10G. There are Juliet balconies at the parlor level and the roof of the extension serves as a terrace
with simple metal railing; and
H. The upper floors have double hung windows in the preserved rear wall and the parapet is to
be modified to accommodate elongated window openings at the top floor; and
I. The cellar is to be excavated 3’ below the existing building with underpinning along the
western wall; and
J. The cellar is extended into the garden with a sub cellar below for a total depth of 21’ below
grade and requires no underpinning; and
K. Representations by the applicant and drawings affirm that great care is being taken to ensure
that the excavation and underground construction meet high standards and that the house and
neighboring structures’ integrity will be assured; now
Therefore, be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends approval of this application as a careful,
respectful restoration and modification of a typical high stoop West Village row house, provided
that care is taken with the excavation and underground construction to ensure the integrity of the
house and neighboring structures.
Vote: Unanimous, 35 Board Members in favor.

Re: Support for the Nomination of 821 Broadway, New York, NY
To the National Register of Historic Places
Honorable Deputy Commissioner Mackay:
On behalf of Community Board 2/Manhattan and our Downtown Community, we are pleased to
offer our support for the nomination of 821 Broadway, New York, NY (“821 Broadway”) for
inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places.
821 Broadway is an 11-story loft building constructed in the Romanesque Revival Style with
overtures to Beaux Arts influences ca. 1906 by architect Samuel Sass. It is situated at the
11northwest corner of Broadway and East 12th Street, and its façade features a dramatically curved
single surface wrapping around and following the corner between East 12th Street and Broadway
to present a continuous primary façade. The cast iron, limestone and terra cotta cornices above
the first, second, fourth, ninth and eleventh floors accentuate that curve, which due to the
diagonal route of Broadway at that location is an acute angle pointing south. The rounded wrap
of the façade is echoed by wide, multi-windowed arches bordered by terra cotta and limestone on
the ninth floor – two on the Broadway façade and three on the East 12th Street façade. The
façade is arranged in bays defined by pilasters framing generous loft windows with limestone
lintels and sills that form a chromatic counterpoint to the orange-red brick which is the primary
component of the façade.
The Building sits at the confluence of the residential areas of Greenwich Village to the West and
East as they meet the commercial and historically industrial corridors in the area south of Union
Square. 821 Broadway is a largely intact example of the loft spaces that defined this area a
century or more ago. Since the Building is taller than its neighboring structures, its intact façade
and curving corner claim additional prominence and significance to the history of this area.
821 Broadway qualifies under the National Register’s Criterion C as a structure that “embod[ies]
the distinctive characteristics of a type, period or method of construction or that represent the
work of a master.” As noted by the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, the
Building having served as the longtime home “of one of Book Row’s longest-surviving shops
that featured an extensive selection of books by Black authors,” and books on “subjects
including Black Studies, radicalism, socialism, and the political left” may well satisfy others of
the National Register’s Criteria.
Too few of the worthy structures in the area south of Union Square that define this confluence of
uses and styles are subject to Landmark designation or protection, making the preservation of
821 Broadway even more important.
For these reasons, Community Board 2/Manhattan supports New York State’s nomination of 821
Broadway for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places. The resolution to that effect
was adopted at our February 22, 2024 Full Board meeting by a vote of 34 in the affirmative with
one abstention.
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us at skent.cb2@gmail.com or
chenaultspence@earthlink.net. Thank you for your consideration of this worthy application.

LAND USE
Green Fast Track for Housing Opportunity
Whereas:
1. In an effort to address New York City’s housing crisis, the Department of City
Planning (DCP) wishes to expedite the approval of certain private, small- and
medium-sized housing projects by exempting them from City Environmental Quality
Review (CEQR) through a rule change called Green Fast Track for Housing (GFTH).
2. GFTH would allow projects of up to 250 housing units in higher-density, residential
districts (R5-10) and up to 175 housing units in lower-density, residential districts (R1-
4) that meet certain density- and site-specific criteria to be newly-categorized as Type
II projects under CEQR. (CB2M does not have any R1-4 districts.)
3. Type II projects are exempt from CEQR review and do not require an Environmental
Assessment Statement (EAS), so unless a project requires a zoning change, it would
not go through the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP), a process that
includes community board review, and deprive the public of valuable information
contained in the EAS documentation.
4. GFTH would also exempt housing proposals of up to 250 units from CEQR review if
they are located in an existing stand-alone commercial or manufacturing zoning
district and are a part of a Board of Standards and Appeals decision or an agreement
with the Department of Housing Preservation and Development.
5. CB2M is in favor of streamlining the construction of housing projects but opposes
any changes that would result in a reduction in community board input.
6. For buildings in historic districts, the Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC)
13would be responsible for confirming that these Type II projects would not have an
impact on historic properties and districts.
7. CB2M, which includes a multitude of historic districts (the most of any community
board) is concerned that LPC staff, already overburdened and under-budgeted, would
be hard-pressed to handle the complexity and ramifications of the additional
determinations.
Therefore, be it resolved that CB2M recommends approval with the following conditions:
1. That DCP conduct a pilot program of 3-5 years, during which time community boards
would automatically receive a Type II memo, i.e., a written notice for each new Type
II project, including the project’s application (at a minimum including the project
description and the plans), a detailed planning rationale for approving a project’s Task
II status that includes correspondence with the relevant agencies tasked with evaluating
the various environmental impacts, all concomitant approvals, and 45 days to review
the application and make a recommendation to DCP.
2. That DCP not exempt residential development in manufacturing districts. Not only
should our city’s manufacturing districts be protected in general, but in the case of
CB2M, our district is home to many large commercial buildings that could be
converted to residential use, but because of their size and proximity to our many small-
scale historic and residential districts, could have a consequential environmental
impact.
3. That DCP find more and better ways to offer a more nuanced approach to addressing
and mitigating the cumulative effects of multiple projects in the same area at the same
time.
4. That DCP identify specific mechanisms to prevent applicants who own large sites
with multiple housing opportunities from deliberately segmenting larger projects so
they appear to be individual projects under the 250-unit (R5-10) and 175-unit (R1-4)
thresholds and not subject to the CEQR process.
5. Should GFTH pass, projects in historic districts should continue to go through a full
LPC review, as opposed to a staff-level review, before being found eligible for fast-
tracking. CB2M recommends that if they are found eligible, LPC should generate a
Type II memo with the same Type II content recommended in Resolved #1 above
(agency correspondence and rationale for the determination that there are no impacts on
historic and archaeological resources) and it should be sent to all community boards
14with the same 45-day time frame for comment. LPC should also be given sufficient
additional funds earmarked to enable it to thoroughly process the resulting increased
workload.
6. That the list of coastal risk districts (none of which currently are in CB2M) be
expanded to include areas of CB2 Manhattan that are routinely subject to flooding,
and at a minimum, the areas impacted by Hurricane Sandy.
7. That all projects subject to CEQR—not just Type II—be required to demonstrate in
a detailed fashion that they are complying with the mandates of Local Law 97.
Vote: Passed, 22 Board Members in favor, 10 against (S. Aaron, K. Berger, A. Brenna, R.
Caccappolo, C. Dignes, A. Hager, R. Kessler, J. Kiely, M. Metzger, E. Smith), 3 abstentions (V.

SCHOOLS AND EDUCATION
Inclusion of Guidelines for Conduct for Parents Members of SLT, CEC, and PTAs,
and Penalties for Violations in Accordance with Chancellor's Regulations on Student-to-
Student Discrimination, Harassment, Intimidation, and/or Bullying (Chancellor's
Regulation A-832) with Specific Penalties for Violations
1. Whereas, the New York City Department of Education (NYC DOE) is committed to
fostering safe and inclusive school environments for all students, and Chancellor's
Regulation A-8321 addresses the prevention and intervention of student-to-student
discrimination, harassment, intimidation, and/or bullying; and
2. Whereas, the active involvement and positive behavior of parents, particularly those serving
on School Leadership Teams (SLT), Community Education Councils (CECs), and Parent-
Teacher Associations (PTAs), contribute significantly to the overall well-being of the school
community; and
3. Whereas, it is essential to establish clear behavioral expectations for parents that align with
those for students and staff and ensure a safe, supportive, and respectful environment within
the school community, and
4. Whereas, while parent bodies that work with the DOE may have a code of conduct included
in their individual by-laws the Chancellor Regulations meant to protect students from
bullying and harassment refer only to staff and student conduct; and
5. Whereas, parent members that sit on official bodies that work with the DOE are prohibited
from displaying backgrounds or materials identifying themselves as candidates in DOE-
supported virtual spaces, including PA/PTA, Presidents’ Council, SLT, Title I PAC, DPAC,
CPAC, and CCEC meetings, except for DOE-sanctioned Candidate Forums to which all
candidates have been invited; and

koreanbddfb32f87c44014947e7f0ac23dd1fd
156. Whereas, the Dignity for All Students Act2, state law in New York, and Chancellor’s
Regulations, specifically Chancellor’s Regulation A-832, of the NYC Department of
Education (DOE) explicitly state that students cannot be subjected to bullying, harassment,
or discrimination in public schools based on any reason, including gender, gender identity,
gender expression, or sexual orientation; and
7. Whereas, these laws and rules extend protection to all students, irrespective of their self-
identification as LGBTQ+ or gender non-binary, or perceptions held by others, ensuring a
safe and inclusive environment before, during, and after school, as well as on the bus and at
school-sponsored events; and
8. Whereas, bullying encompasses various forms such as physical violence, stalking,
aggressive gestures, threats, taunts, teasing, purposeful exclusion from peer groups, use of
derogatory language or slurs, and offensive material distributed via email, online platforms
(e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, or TikTok…), or in print; and
9. Whereas, recent legislation and proposed legislation seeks to support protections, rights,
and recognition of LGBTQ+ children and families, such as:
○ Senate Bill (S2428) Requires LGBT awareness curriculum or instruction
○ The Modern Families Act (S1787) – Currently in Children’s and Families
○ Anti-Discrimination Requirements in Schools (S1532) – Currently in Education
○ Trans Safe Haven (S2475A) - Signed into Law 2023
Reporting Acts of Bullying
10. Whereas, avenues for reporting to the DOE include calling 311 or (718) 935-2288, allowing
individuals to seek assistance from the Office of Safety and Youth Development via email
at RespectForAll@schools.nyc.gov or by phone at (718) 935-4357; and
11. Whereas, another option is to contact the Division of Family and Community
Empowerment through email at face@schools.nyc.gov or by phone at (212) 374-2323; and
Therefore Be It Resolved, that Community Board 2 demands that the NYC DOE acknowledge
the importance of addressing the behavior of parents serving on SLTs, CECs, and PTAs in
alignment with Chancellor's Regulation A-832; and be it further
Resolved, that CB2 calls on Chancellor David Banks and the NYC DOE to require that parents
serving on SLTs, CECs, and PTAs be expected to adhere to the principles and guidelines outlined
in Chancellor's Regulation A-832, particularly in their interactions with students, staff, and other
parents; and be it further
Resolved, that CB2 encourages the adoption of specific penalties for parent members of all official
bodies that work with the DOE found in violation of Chancellor's Regulation A-832, including but
not limited to:
○ Verbal Warning: A formal verbal warning may be issued to the parent, clearly outlining
the nature of the violation and the expected corrective action.
○ Written Warning: In cases where the behavior persists, a written warning shall be issued,
specifying the violation and the potential consequences if the behavior continues.
2 The Dignity for All Students Act: https://www.nysed.gov/student-support-services/dignity-all-students-act-dasa
16○ Suspension of Parental Involvement: For serious or repeated violations, the parent may
be suspended from participating in SLT, CEC, or PTA activities for a specified period,
during which they are expected to reflect on their behavior.
○ Permanent Removal: In cases of severe or persistent violations that significantly impact
individual students and/or the school community, the parent may be subject to permanent
removal from their role on the Community Education Council (CEC), the Citywide Council
on High Schools (CCHS), the Citywide Council on Special Education (CCSE), the Citywide
Council on English Language Learners (CCELL), the Citywide Council for D75 (CCD75),
Parent Teacher Association (PTA/PA), School Leadership Team (SLT), or any official body
that works with the DOE, or NYC Public Schools; and be it further
Resolved, that CB2 encourages the NYC DOE to establish clear procedures for investigating and
addressing violations and ensuring due process and fairness in the enforcement of penalties; and
be it further
Resolved, that CB2 affirm the importance of public schools as safe, nonpartisan spaces for all
children, including LGBTQ+ youth, to obtain a robust and inclusive education; and be it finally
Resolved, that the NYC DOE shall communicate these expectations and penalties to parent
members of all official bodies that work with the DOE, fostering a collaborative effort to maintain
a positive and inclusive school community.
Vote: Unanimous, 35 Board Members in favor.

which came before Community Board 2, Man. in March/2019 for an On-Premises Restaurant
Liquor License to operate a “fresh seafood focused neighborhood restaurant” consisting of
eight (8) tables and 24 seats and one bar with 8 seats for a total interior seating of 32 patrons
and operated from 2019 until closing in February/2024 at 54 Great Jones Street in one
building, that premises for Marlinspike Hall being substantially different than the application
as presented here for NoHo Neighbors LLC; that premises ,Marlinspike Hall LLC, also
operating under a fully executed set of stipulations differing from the application presented
for NoHo Neighbors LLC; and
v. Whereas, the instant application for NoHo Neighbors LLC is also expanding the premises to
a new separate adjacent space to the North and behind the current building (expanding into
350 Bowery, Block #531/Lot #42) through a newly created opening between the two existing
buildings, though this is not specifically disclosed as an expansion in CB2’s questionnaire or
in the 30-day notice provided to Community Board 2, Man. which both state that this is strictly
a transfer application via an asset purchase agreement from Marlinspike Hall LLC; this new
separate space will be a new back room accessed through a newly created opening between
two separate buildings with fire door with approximately 10 additional tables and 22
additional seats in addition to a new cellar space under 350 Bowery accessed via stairs in the
new backroom, the existing cellar space under 54 Great Jones will remain accessed through a

from the newly added adjacent rear room will be created by adding a new exit corridor passing
through yet another separate and adjacent building (348 Bowery aka 56 Great Jones St., Block
#531/Lot #43); and
vi. Whereas, NoHo Neighbors LLC first appeared before Community Board 2, Man. in
January/2024 to present a comparable application at which time members of the community
appeared by submission and stated there had been no outreach to neighboring immediately-
impacted buildings, the application filing coming to the Community Board over the Christmas
and New Year’s holidays when many members of the community are away; members of the
community stating there had been issues regarding kitchen venting and patron noise from the
previous licensee and ongoing for years, that licensee, Marlinspike Hall LLC dba Jolene,
having earlier hours consisting of closing at 12 AM Sunday to Wednesday and 1 AM
Thursday to Saturday and had signed stipulations that there would be no fried foods to
alleviate issues with odors from poor venting, those stipulations not being adhered to,
additional concerns being raised about the expansion of hours for NoHo Neighbors LLC to a
2 AM closing, 7 days a week and the additional expansion regarding the size of the restaurant,
there being no plan in place to address the venting issues, in fact the building manager stating
that due to the age and other restrictions on the building(s) in additon to a preexisting
condition, there was nothing that could be done to further improve the venting, the existing
venting would not be able to be installed today and would not meet current NYC Code
24requirements, the vent being located on the wall directly in front of the premises at head
height,, additional concerns being raised about noise in the later evening / early morning hours
from the establishment and from patrons arriving and leaving at those later hours, the
immediate area being surrounded by residential units, many with young school-age children
including 48 Great Jones immediately next door; and
vii. Whereas, at the January/2024 Community Board 2, Man. SLA Committee meeting the
Committee voted to recommend denial of the application, immediately following the meeting
the Applicant requested to lay the application over to February/2024 in order to do outreach
to the buildings in the immediate area, the layover request being accommodated with no denial
resolution written despite the Committee’s vote in order to facilitate dialogue with
immediately impacted residents who had been away during the holidays; and
viii. Whereas, the Applicant met with the various adjacent building representatives to explain the
application and conduct a walk-through of the premises, the Applicant affirming that it is
impossible to improve the venting of the premises because no permits could be approved to
properly vent the kitchen, instead offering to have the front part of the premises (the
Marlinspike Hall LLC dba Jolene space that is the transfer application) offer light bites with
the newly-expanded rear premises functioning as the restaurant, the proposed theory being
that with the lite bites in the front area there would be no increase on cooking/venting;
questions arising as to how that would be controlled given the doubling of seats and being
that the spaces are joined and operating as one DBA and one method of operation with one
kitchen which would now have double the seating capacity; in addition, the Applicant
highlighted that the menu had been adjusted in an effort to eliminate odors yet fries, burgers
and other heavy foods remain on the menu, additional questions being raised that if the whole
premises is operating as a restaurant and not a bar/tavern/lounge, how are the specifics of the
menu able to be switched up randomly between the front and back room to deal with resident’s
concerns about venting as opposed to having a clear idea of a menu and method of operation
that realizes the constrictions of the space; additional concerns being raised that the front
would function as a bar in the later evening with hours until 2 AM daily; and
ix. Whereas, multiple members of the community representing a number of surrounding
buildings containing many residents came to speak in opposition to the application in
February/2024 in addition to a number of people immediately impacted speaking on behalf
of their Co-op Boards, raising concerns about the expansion of seating at the premises, the
further confirmation of the inability to solve the kitchen venting issues and the expansion of
noise on the streets with the proposed later hours of the instant application, the Applicant
unwilling to adjust their operating hours or method of operation to be more in line with
neighboring restaurants as opposed to bars despite having a full kitchen; there being no
solutions to the non-conforming ventilation setup; and
x. Whereas, this application being subject to the 500 Foot Rule requiring the Applicant to
demonstrate that the public interest would be served by the granting of the On-Premises
Liquor License at this location, there being 55 active licenses within 750 ft. and 6 pending
licenses according to LAMP; the hours being later than the previously licensed premises from
whom a “transfer” is sought through an asset purchase, the hours also being later than other
25nearby restaurants on the same street and block, the number of seats doubling, there being no
way to build a new exhaust system to vent the kitchen to current codes; there being an
expansion of the premises into the adjacent building, with a new egress being proposed
through a third building, those permits for connecting spaces in three buildings not being
presented, there being questions of public safety by combining these spaces; and it also being
unclear if the proposed plans would be approved by DOB; and
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that Community Board 2, Manhattan recommends denial of
the application for an On-Premises Liquor License for Noho Neighbors LLC 54 Great Jones St
10012; and
THEREFORE BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that should this application be considered by
the NYSLA, CB2, Manhattan respectfully requests that this item be calendared to appear before
the Full Board of the NYSLA.

making at the W. 4th St., 14th St./Union Sq., and 14th St./8th Ave. subway stations (all stations
that are heavily used by Community Board 2 Manhattan (CB2) constituents), as part of a larger
project that includes 19 elevator replacements at eight stations, including other areas of
Manhattan; and
Whereas work has begun at all three stations and is expected to be entirely completed the 4th
quarter of 2025, a considerable length of time in which users who depend on elevators to enable
their access and ensure their ability to ride the subway will be denied the chance to make the
customary trips they need to conduct their lives (e.g., going to work, to school, to medical visits)
without undergoing great discomfort and displacement; and
Whereas the work at each of the three stations (which has already begun) is being conducted in
phases:
55• The W. 4th St. station (servicing the A, B, C, D, E, F,& M trains) will receive three new
elevators, installed in three phases: 1) Elevator from the downtown A/C/E platform to the
transfer mezzanine and downtown B/D/F/M platform removed from service until
replacement is complete Q3 2024; 2) Street level elevator on W. 3rd St. & 6th Ave (n.e.
corner) to mezzanine for A, C, E service and access to B, D, F, M service removed from
service Q3 2024 until replacement is complete Q1 2025; 3) Elevator connecting uptown
A, C, E platform to transfer mezzanine and uptown B, D, F, M platform removed from
service Q1 2025 until replacement is complete Q4 2025.
• The 14th St./Union Sq. station (servicing the 4, 5, 6, L, N, Q, R & W trains) will receive
four new elevators, installed in three phases: 1) Center elevator servicing the mezzanine
and the uptown N, Q, R & W platform, removed from service until replacement is
complete Q3 2024; 2) Elevator from mezzanine to downtown N, Q, R, W platform
removed from service Q3 2024 until replacement is complete Q1 2025; 3) Elevator from
mezzanine to L platform (both directions) + the street level elevator removed from
service Q1 2025 until replacement is completed later in 2025.
• The 14th St./8th Ave. station (servicing the 8th Ave. line in Manhattan (A, C, E & L
trains) will receive two new elevators, installed in two phases: 1) Elevator at 14th St. &
8th Ave. removed from service until replacement is complete Q3 2024; 2) Elevator
connecting mezzanine to the L platform level removed from service Q3 2024 with
replacement completion expected later in 2025; and
Whereas NYCT has indicated that work on the elevators at each of the three stations will not
overlap, i.e., work will be done on only one elevator at a time at a station, with work on the next
elevator beginning only after work on the previous one is completed, allowing for at least one
elevator to be operating. However, the elevator in operation at each station will be connecting
platforms/levels going in only one direction, forcing those who want to travel in the opposite
direction to seek other unwieldy alternatives for access; and
Whereas two escalator replacements at the W. 4th St. subway station will be done as part of a
separate MTA project at the W. 4th St. station: 1) The escalator from the uptown B/D/F/M
platform to the uptown A/C/E platform will be removed from service until replacement is
completed, through Fall 2024; 2) The escalator from the downtown B/D/F/M platform to the
downtown A/C/E platform will be removed from service Fall 2024 until replacement is
completed Fall 2025. This work won't be on the same side of the station as elevator
replacements, but will still allow access to travel in only one direction at a time, presenting
similar challenges to the limits in elevator access; and
Whereas for mitigation of this disrupted access, NYCT has suggested a number of different
alternatives for accessing these subway stations for train travel in the required direction or for
access in another travel mode, including the use of ramps, when available, to switch from one
side of the station to the other, taking trains in the opposite direction (e.g. uptown) from a
destination (e.g. downtown) to reach a station that allows elevator access to trains in the desired
direction (e.g. downtown), with a variety of approaches to transfer at these stations like exiting
the station completely and using an entrance in another location for trains in the opposite
direction or crossing from one platform to another, as well as using public buses; and
56Whereas the alternatives suggested (involving copious and lengthy walking, going up and down
stairs that can be dangerously crowded and too steep to safely carry anything, navigating
confusing pathways, and dealing with much longer trips, sometimes double the time that they
customarily take) present a cumbersome set of options that are physically demanding, tiring,
time consuming, disorienting, and difficult to maneuver, especially for the people who most and
often only can rely on elevator access to subway stations, including the disabled, those advanced
in years, individuals who have difficulty walking, wheelchair users, people with strollers and
small children, even riders carrying large and heavy packages; and
Whereas another suggested alternative, public bus use, has potential but at this time presents
limitations, particularly in lack of speed and frequency. NYCT suggested the M5, but the M5
first begins at 31st St., heading uptown (not to the CB2 area). The M55, which has taken over
from the M5 for the downtown route, has been reported by many CB2 constituents to be
exceptionally slow and infrequent. Other suggestions, such as the M1, M7, M14(A&D), M20,
were met with equal concern, including the absence of any bus service at many locations and the
difficulty for those who are physically challenged to reach existing bus stops; and
Whereas NYCT often runs free shuttle buses when construction at stations, track work or
signalization modernization is being done, to substitute for the suspended subway service that
occurs as a result of this work, e.g., shuttle buses recently replaced weekend F trains during
signal upgrades on the Culver line, and shuttle buses are planned for the G train shutdown; and
Whereas NYCT has noted that messaging and wayfinding signage are being put ""in place and
around the stations,"" to let users know about the elevator and escalator replacements, but users
need to be alerted in advance of heading to a station to prepare them for handling the
replacement conditions (or find other options), especially those with physical challenges,
whether hearing, sight or restricted movement, and those lacking the technical proficiency to
access online information. They also need to receive clear and highly visible notice at the
entrance to a station before entering; and
Whereas CB2 has received numerous complaints about the filthy, unsanitary and foul-smelling
conditions in the subway elevators and pleas for better, more regular maintenance; and
Whereas in view of these new elevators being installed to improve the comfort and access of
those who most rely on them while failing in the replacement interim to provide adequate
substitute service to those same vulnerable and dependent users, compensation for depriving
these users of this sorely needed service or a convenient substitute would be appropriate;
Therefore be it resolved that CB2 thanks NYCT for their informative overview of the elevator
replacements being undertaken at the W. 4th St., 14th St./Union Sq., and 14th St./8th Ave.
subway stations and for their responsiveness in attempting to answer our questions and address
our concerns. CB2 also appreciates NYCT's provision of a project hotline and email address as
well as direct emails and phone numbers to community relations representatives; and
Be it further resolved that while CB2 appreciates the prospect of having new, more up-to-date
and hopefully better functioning and well-cared-for elevators at these locations which NYCT has
57indicated will comply with new ADA regulations and include communication and fire alarm
upgrades, more accessible car operating panels, and a new screen system, we do not understand
why elevators that still work were not simply repaired, refurbished, upgraded and cleaned up,
thereby taking less time to have a sorely needed function out of service and freeing funds for
elevator installations and other ADA accessibility for stations that have none; and
Be it further resolved that CB2 asks that NYCT further explore and implement alternatives that
can more comfortably accommodate the needs of these stations' already challenged elevator
users, especially by increasing bus service frequency, facilitating bus access, instructing drivers
to make every stop, and having a predictable schedule (at least for the duration of the
replacement project, although this should occur at all times), and by temporarily providing
dedicated bus lanes on those routes expected to be most used that don't already have them, to
decrease trip times by avoiding the incursion of other traffic; and
Be it further resolved that CB2 encourages NYCT to provide free shuttle bus service at the
three stations to transport riders to the next subway stop that has working elevators on the route
going in whatever is the needed direction at each project stage that leads to their destination; and
Be it further resolved that CB2 urges NYCT to widely disseminate information about the
elevator replacements both by distributing notifications that alert users before going to a station
and providing information at the station, preferably reaching out with simple, clear, written
descriptions and illustrations or perhaps offering information sessions to the many local
community organizations that serve seniors and the disabled, schools and other community
groups and institutions, and at the station posting highly visible signs outside with concise, easy-
to-read and illustrated details about the work going on within, while having personnel on hand to
direct people inside the station and supplying handouts and broadcasting public announcements
there (in addition to issuing digital information), making all of this information available in
different commonly-used languages; and
Be it further resolved that CB2 strongly advises that a strict maintenance schedule be set up for
regularly cleaning and maintaining the new elevators; and
Be it finally resolved that CB2 suggests that NYCT consider a fare reduction at these three
stations in keeping with the service reduction for the duration of the project.
Vote: Unanimous, with 35 Board members in favor.
2. Resolution in support of Universal Daylighting.
Whereas in New York City (NYC), over half the crashes by motor vehicles and the vast
majority of severe injuries and fatalities resulting from vehicular conflicts occur at intersections3;
and
3 https://highways.dot.gov/safety/intersection-safety/about
58Whereas these crashes occur most often directly in crosswalks, where the most pedestrian
activity in the street takes place, including the most vulnerable users of our streets, i.e., senior
citizens, children, people pushing strollers, the disabled, those in wheelchairs, although anyone
walking across the street in these locations is at risk; and
Whereas at the root of these crashes is a lack of visibility. Drivers of motor vehicles turning at
these intersections are typically blocked from seeing people using the crosswalk by vehicles
parked up to or close to the curb or even in part of the crosswalk. At the same time, pedestrians
who are crossing are blocked from seeing turning vehicles; and
Whereas in these circumstances, it also is difficult for bicyclists turning at an intersection to see
pedestrians in the crosswalk or for motorists making these turns to see bicyclists; and
Whereas daylighting is a street safety technique that has long been in practice to enhance
visibility, supported by the U.S. Dept. of Transportation, fully recommended by the National
Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO), and part of NY State law, as well as used
by the NYC Dept. of Transportation (DOT) in many of its street improvement projects as part of
its toolbox of street safety applications; and
Whereas daylighting removes visual obstacles (most commonly parked cars or trucks, but also
could be roadway dining or other blockages) that impair drivers' ability to see pedestrians
waiting at or walking in crosswalks or at corners (or pedestrians' ability to see approaching
vehicles) by employing parking regulations, also used in combination with curb extensions, that
provide clearance for visibility (typically 20-30 ft. beyond the crosswalk to the corner); and
Whereas NY State law (Section 1202) prohibits parking within 20 ft. of an intersection, but
NYC was able to and chose to opt out of this requirement which could save so many lives; and
Whereas NYC Mayor Eric Adams supports daylighting 1,000 intersections a year4, but this is
just a tiny fraction of NYC's 47,000 intersections5; and
Whereas CB2 has been requesting daylighting at many problematic corners for many years;
Therefore be it resolved that CB2 strongly supports the application of universal daylighting as
standard policy within our district and throughout NYC (in concert with the NY State law) and
urges the City Council to enact legislation to that end and the DOT to follow through with a
broad program of daylighting implementation; and
Be it further resolved that CB2 urges including in the requirements physical barriers (beyond
just parking enforcement and signage), such as planters, substantial bollards, granite blocks or
4 https://www.6sqft.com/nyc-pledges-to-make-1000-intersections-safer-for-pedestrians/

2023 Update, p. 1.
59bioswales, all under three ft. high (at or under eye level), that define the daylighting space and
safeguard those using it from harmful vehicular incursion while providing needed self-
enforcement of the allocated space; and
Be it further resolved that CB2 recommends that DOT incorporate daylighting whenever any
street paving is done; and
Be it finally resolved that CB2 asks that CB2 (and other community boards) be given the option
as part of the requested universal daylighting program to select sites identified as particularly
vulnerable and/or dangerous in its district to be given priority for quick daylighting remediation.

Supporting Councilman Christopher Marte’s proposal to eliminate the conversion fee that
the 2021 SoHo/NoHo rezoning imposes on some residents seeking to change their certificate
2of occupancy from Joint Live-Work Quarters for Artists use (JLWQA, aka AIR) to
straight residential use. (The fee is meant to fund an Arts Fund to benefit artists.)

• This proposed ""Arts Fund"" fee for a questionable and ill-defined use is manifestly
unfair and singles out the continuing homeowners of this neighborhood for
economic punishment even as the city moves forward with a new rezoning
proposal called City of Yes for Economic Opportunity.
• Putting a fee onto a sale of a home of one type of person to another type of person
is unconscionable.
• Taxation is supposed to treat all people the same way. This fee clearly does not.
• This charge places an unconscionable burden on the ability of many SoHo
homeowners to realize the value of their most important asset as they age out of
their current homes and even if they wish to pass these homes down to their
families,
• This Arts Fund fee ironically hammers all of the artists still living here who made
this neighborhood what it is and are now being asked to pay a very high and
unexpected exit tax on their contribution to SoHo culture over many years and
decades. This proposed ""Arts Fund"" fee for a questionable and ill-defined use is
manifestly unfair and singles out the continuing homeowners of this
neighborhood for economic punishment even as the city moves forward with a
new rezoning proposal called City of Yes for Economic Opportunity.

• Kook Burger owners misrepresented themselves as a family restaurant, when in fact they
intend to operate a sports bar with two TVs. Too much noise for a quiet, residential
neighborhood. Neighbors are vehemently opposed, especially if the bar will be open late
hours. Noise from the previous establishment carried into adjacent apartments at an
intolerable level. Accumulation of garbage that attracts rats will also be a huge problem.
Please deny this application. If approved, please at least stipulate no outdoor seating and

EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
Resolution in Support of the World Trade Center Health Program Youth Research Cohort
Whereas
1) On and after September 11th, more than 35,000 people younger than 21 years old were
exposed to toxic dust and smoke from the World Trade Center (WTC) disaster; and
132) In December 2022, Congress amended section 3341(c) of the Public Health Service Act (42
U.S.C. § 300mm–51(c)) to include a Research Cohort for Emerging Health Impacts on Youth
(individuals who were 21 years of age or younger on September 11, 2001), and this act
instructs the World Trade Center Health Program (WTCHP) Administrator, in consultation
with the Secretary of Education, to establish this research cohort to track this population’s
health longitudinally; and
3) To meet scientific standards, the Youth Research Cohort must be of sufficient size to conduct
future research studies on the health and education impacts of 9/11 exposures, and must be
sufficiently representative of those who were 21 years old or younger at the time of exposure,
and reflect the diversity of the communities exposed in Manhattan below 14th Street and into
the borough of Brooklyn; and
4) The Youth Research Cohort must include large numbers of individuals who have symptoms
linked to 9/11 (Certified-eligible WTC survivors) and large numbers of individuals who do
not (Screening-eligible Survivors); and
5) The WTC Scientific/Technical Advisory Committee (STAC) was convened at the request of
Dr. John Howard, WTCHP Administrator, for a June 21, 2023, meeting where it heard from
scientists, young survivors and other stakeholders, and discussed recommended approaches
for the new Youth Research Cohort to be established by the WTCHP; and
6) A June 29, 2023, letter from the STAC Chair put forward the STAC’s recommendations
addressing how the WTCHP should support and facilitate the process for reaching, recruiting
and retaining a cohort of young survivors. See:
https://www.cdc.gov/wtc/pdfs/stac/LTR_Ward_STAC_23_June_2023_Sta mped-508.pdf
7) The WTCHP has issued a Request for Information (RFI) seeking feedback from the 9/11-
affected community, as well as researchers, educators, etc. on the preferred approach for
establishing a Youth Research Cohort, and on which health conditions are research priorities;
now
Therefore, be it resolved that
1) Manhattan Community Board 2 recognizes that the new 9/11 Youth Research Cohort is
essential for tracking the health of young survivors who lived or attended school or daycare
in Lower Manhattan on 9/11 or in the weeks and months after, and that a successful cohort
will yield key findings regarding unmet 9/11-related health needs of young survivors, as well
as the survivor community; and
2) Manhattan Community Board 2 pledges its support for this critical endeavor so that the
process of assembling the cohort will benefit from the productive engagement of residents
who experienced the 9/11 attacks and their aftermath and who committed to and
accomplished the successful rebuilding of their neighborhoods and their lives; and
143) Manhattan Community Board 2 endorses the STAC’s recommendations. including but not
limited to the need for community involvement in building the cohort and partnerships with a
broad range of researchers, clinicians and stakeholders; the need for incentives to recruit
young survivors and the hiring of young adults for peer-to-peer/ recruitment work; the
need to leverage innovative technologies and social media to conduct outreach, recruitment
and retention; a national outreach campaign to raise awareness and recruit young survivors
who are no longer in the NYC Metro area, among other recommendations; and
4) Manhattan Community Board 2 joins the STAC in supporting the inclusion in the cohort of
young survivors whose exposures to the WTC disaster occurred in utero. Research over
decades has demonstrated that toxic pollutants to which the mother is exposed can harm the
developing fetus. Studies led by Dr. Frederica Perera of the Columbia Center for Children’s
Environmental Health found that children prenatally exposed to the WTC disaster were more
likely to be born small for gestational age, and to have exposure-related ‘DNA adducts’
which can increase lifetime cancer risk. CB 2 calls for people who were in utero and whose
mothers were present in the disaster area for sufficient time during the period from
September 12, 2001, to July 31, 2002 (as set forth by the Zadroga Act) to be eligible for the
cohort; and
5) Manhattan Community Board 2 supports the WTCHP revisiting the use of the NYC
Department of Education’s directory lists from 2001/2002 (following an unsuccessful effort
by the WTC Health Registry’s vendor), but with the proviso that better methods for
recruitment be used, including use of communication tools targeted to the relevant age
groups (social media, text messaging) and leveraging existing stakeholder partnerships, both
local and national. We agree that the WTCHP cannot rely solely on the DOE lists, because
many 9/11-exposed people were too young to be in school in 2001/2002 or attended private
schools at the time. These individuals must be fully represented in the cohort and will need
outreach/recruitment; and
6) In order to build a cohort that is sufficiently large and representative, the WTCHP must
activate the extensive community support infrastructure of Lower Manhattan – the
community centers, settlement houses, tenant associations and not-for-profits that span
Lower Manhattan, along with religious and independent schools and institutions of higher
education, many of whom are directly engaged with residents and other survivors; and
7) Manhattan Community Board 2 recommends that the WTCHP create several tiers of grant
opportunities of different funding amounts through which groups like these can fund their
outreach using records and relationships that only they have. For example, community
centers that ran day care, pre-school and after-school programs on 9/11 and in the subsequent
months often have long term relationships with the families they served. In addition, we
emphasize the importance of a more streamlined, accessible process with plain language
instructions for small organizations to apply for grants. It is important for WTCHP to avoid
excessive reporting requirements which pose a burden to smaller groups for these
opportunities; and
158) The WTCHP is requesting feedback regarding which health conditions and potential social
and education impacts should be priorities for future research on the WTC Youth. Manhattan
Community Board 2 agrees with young survivors, parents, and the Survivors Steering
Committee that these impacts should be research priorities: reproductive health problems,
autoimmune disease, neurocognitive problems, metabolic disorders related to exposures to
endocrine disrupting chemicals, cancers, delayed-onset PTSD or other psychological impacts
triggered or exacerbated by serious WTC-related illness of a parent. We also ask how some
of these physical and/or psychological impacts have affected educational attainment. If the
WTC Survivor Data Center is detecting increased frequency of a condition in the patient
population of people exposed as children, that condition may become a research priority; and
9) Manhattan Community Board 2 requests that the WTCHP immediately set up on its website
a means for young survivors to sign-up for the cohort. In addition, we recommend that the
WTCHP send out letters to survivor members explaining what the Youth Research Cohort is
and how young survivors can sign up; and
10) The entire Youth Research Cohort process, from planning to recruitment to research, must
entail community engagement. Findings must be shared by the WTCHP with young
survivors and the broader community, with ample opportunity for Q&A.
Vote: Unanimous, 42 Board Members in favor.
LANDMARKS AND PUBLIC AESTHETICS
FIRST LANDMARKS MEETING
1. *801 Greenwich St. – Application is to convert the existing office building to five
residential units with ground floor retail, construct new masonry stair and elevator
bulkhead and install mechanical units with fenced enclosure.
Whereas:
A. The bulkhead providing increased stairway access to the roof and an adjacent elevator
bulkhead are in brick and a lower mechanical equipment enclosure toward the back is in dark
painted metal; and
B. The side wall of the bulkhead that is above the building’s visible party wall is in a contrasting
material and would be less conspicuous if it were built of brick matching the side wall.
C. The applicant represented that the elevator bulkhead is the lowest that is available for the
purpose; and
D. Photographs of the mockup show visibility in line with the norm in the neighborhood for
buildings of this type; and
16E. There was concern expressed about the extent of staff approval, rather than a public hearing,
for the window replacements and the ground floor; now
Therefore, be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends approval of this application provided
that the side wall of the bulkhead be aligned with the building’s visible party wall below and
built of brick to match.
Vote: Unanimous, 41 Board members in favor.
2. *803 Greenwich St. – Application is to convert the existing 3 family building to a single
family and construct a new masonry stair, elevator bulkhead and install mechanical units
with fenced enclosure. (Will be reviewed at LPC staff level)
3. *307-309 Sixth Ave. – Application is to demolish the existing buildings and construct a
new building.
Whereas:
A. The two buildings proposed for demolition are much altered and the structures have no
discernible architectural or historic value; and
B. The two lots are being built on as one with varying heights reflecting the separate zoning
areas; and
C. The front facade is six stories with pairs of narrow and tall recessed casement windows,
atypical of the district, and faced with a modern Roman 3” x 12” brick, with limestone trim and
cornice, and features distinctive modern convex and concave masonry framing five rows of six
windows with a central division; and
D. Despite the proposal’s reference to the rich examples of tenement architecture in the
Greenwich Village Historic District Extension II, the framing of the facade, and size and type of
windows show a lack of any meaningful relationship to the historic punched windows and the
interaction of the horizontal and vertical banding in facades of the tenement buildings of this
district, and thereby contribute to a façade that unduly asserts itself into the streetscape and
seems more appropriate in SoHo; and
E. A penthouse with window walls and stucco and expanses of reflective glass barriers is placed
three feet from the front facade; and
F. The storefront is minimal modernist with no historic reference to the district; and
G. The penthouse is visually aggressive and clearly asserts itself as an unattractive seventh story
rather than a minimally visible rooftop structure, especially in that it lacks an adequate setback
similar to others in the district; and
17H. The lot line party walls are brick and are acceptably visible similar to other buildings in the
district, but carry over the front façade modern Roman brick onto these side facades rather than
using the common brick that is characteristic of the district; and
I. There is minimal excavation in the open space behind the building and is not adjacent to any
existing structures; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:
A. Approval of the demolition of the two existing buildings of no historic or architectural value;
and
B. Approval of the massing of the building and its side and rear walls; and
C. Denial of the front facade design, including the metal storefront, the windows’ size,
proportion and operation, the concave and convex vertical design of the columns, and the
proportion of masonry to glass, a clearly contemporary design without reference or respect to the
specific rich historic character of the district; and
D. Denial of use of any brick other than common brick on lot line façades.
Vote: Passed, 40 Board members in favor, 1 abstention (R. Kessler).
SECOND LANDMARKS MEETING
4. *180 Waverly Pl. - Application previously heard to be modified with changes to the
rooftop addition and addition of an elevator bulkhead on the roof and alterations to a
window on the rear facade, and modify the chimney.
Whereas:
A. The application was previously heard and the applicant has made modifications to the rooftop
bulkhead with mechanical screening, addition of an elevator bulkhead, and modifications to a
window to accommodate the elevator; and
B. The stair bulkhead has been made smaller and there is a mechanicals screen above it; and
C. A third-floor rear window will be removed and replaced with brick infill to cover the elevator
shaft creating a disturbing condition in the symmetrical facade; and
D. The change in visibility results in a minimal increase in the visibility of the mechanical
screen; and
E. The chimney is less visible from a public thoroughfare; and
18F. The rear cornice is slightly modified to accommodate the brick infilled window opening; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:
A. Approval of the modifications to the chimney, the stair bulkhead, the mechanical screen, and
the addition of the elevator bulkhead; and
B. Introduction of historic detail to the windows on the rear facade (heard in the prior
presentation); and
C. Denial of the brick infill of the third-floor window, that the window be preserved and an
interior solution be devised to mask the elevator shaft.
Vote: Unanimous, 42 Board members in favor.
5. *121 Waverly Pl. – Application is to replace one-over-one double-hung windows in kind
at existing openings of the front facade
Whereas:
A. The present condition of one over one windows is documented as early as the 1940s tax
photograph and existed at the time of designation; and
B. The house is a lone row house between two large buildings with much of its historic detailing
missing; and
C. The existing one over one wooden windows are to be replaced in kind; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Manhattan recommends approval of the replacement in
kind of windows that are typical of modifications to similar buildings in the district, date at least
to the 1940s, and existed at the time of designation.
Vote: Unanimous, 42 Board members in favor.
6. *57 & 59 Christopher St. – Application is to construct a one-story rooftop expansion for
the two buildings.
Whereas:
A. The modifications are proposed to be carried out in connection with extensive rebuilding
after fire damage in order to increase headroom at top floor to make it a usable living space; and
B. The location, facing a small park and open avenue, affords clear visibility of the front of the
building from near and far; and
C. The “crawl space attic” at the front of the building is to be heightened with a pitched front
wall and punched windows and a new cornice to provide occupiable space; and
D. The slight pitch of the roof is only from the façade and is an incomplete “mansard” type roof,
with a standing seam brown face and small punched windows, and results in fake look where a
19steeper pitch (eliminate tiny roof deck) with tall glazing would have less visibility and evoke
historic studio windows as was the stated intention of the applicant; and
E. The bulkhead is being modified to accommodate increased height of the stairs, to give
rooftop access and is clad in standing seam metal and is not objectionably visible; and
F. The cornice and inconspicuous light mesh safety railing do not detract from the building; and
G. The front and rear facades and windows will be restored, replacing degraded material in kind
where necessary, preserving the existing design; and
H. A representative from Village Preservation and a member of the public gave testimony
noting the property’s proximity to an individual landmark (Stonewall Inn) and a National
Historic Site (Christopher Park), now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Manhattan recommends:
A. Approval of the bulk of the rooftop addition, modification of the stair bulkhead, restoration
of the front and rear facades, cornice, and railing; and
B. Denial of the front facade rooftop addition unless the pitch is increased and the amount of
glazing is increased to lessen visibility and to evoke a historic artist’s studio window.
Vote: Unanimous, 42 Board members in favor.
7. *670 Broadway – Application is to construct a rooftop bulkhead (elevator) and
additions.
Whereas:
A. The location of the bulkhead, adjacent to the existing elevator, is dictated by the structure of
the building and is in the least visible practical location and is code conforming; and
B. The visible walls of the addition are in brick matching the existing elevator bulkhead and the
non-visible walls are grey metal; and
C. The visibility is typical of similar rooftop structures in the district and does not detract from
the building; and
D. Members of the public had questions about the application which were satisfactorily
answered; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Manhattan recommends approval of the application.
Vote: Unanimous, 42 Board members in favor.
208. *67 Greene St. – Application is to remove and replace diamond plate platform at
sidewalk; construct new steps and install handrails; and replace damaged steel beams.
A. The existing diamond plate is in poor condition and structural work at the cellar level is also
required; and
B. The portion of the platform in front of the two doors is to be lowered to the sidewalk level
with two steps(which would benefit from nosing)and landing at the entrances, and there are
simple metal railings; and
C. The platform sections in front of the show windows are to be lowered to sidewalk grade; and
D. Similar diamond plate material to the existing will be used throughout; and
E. These modifications are similar to those approved by the Commission at the matching
building next door; and
F. The vertical pipe from a historic fire suppression system is to be retained, preserving this
important historic artifice of the district; and
G. It is noted that ADA access is not provided, as has been successfully carried out in similar
buildings in the district, by lowering the entrances to grade or adding an exterior ramp; and
H. It is noted that very similar buildings, especially those located next to one another and that
are matching, in the district are undergoing widely divergent modifications with the loss of the
unity that is an important feature of SoHo cast iron buildings; and
I. A member of the public had questions and comments about the ADA aspects of the
application; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Manhattan recommends:
A. Approval of removal of the platform, reconfiguration of the entrances provided that the steps
are modified to provide nosing, and
B. Replacing the diamond plate in kind; and
C. That the applicant provide ADA access at the two entrances.
Vote: Unanimous, 42 Board members in favor.
LAND USE
1. City of Yes for Economic Opportunity – Citywide Text Amendment
21The City of Yes: Economic Opportunity Zoning Text Amendment (COYEO) is an ambitious
and historic reworking of New York City’s Zoning Resolution. MCB2 has found some benefits
in the changes but has identified many concerns and objections that are specific to our District.
MCB2 agrees with numerous other community boards who feel that the timetable for community
board review and response is unreasonably short and therefore counterproductive, given the
wide-ranging changes that are proposed.17
Whereas:
The COYEO city-wide zoning text amendment raises the following overarching concerns:
• By allowing commercial uses above the ground floor in mixed-use buildings, the text
amendment creates the potential for conflicts of uses that could directly impact quality of
life in residential neighborhoods and buildings and the safety of their inhabitants.
• Maintaining community board review at its current level is essential as it is the best way
to hear directly from the community about potential impacts–negative or positive. The
elimination of community board review inherent in COYEO deprives the community and
city of important information on proposed changes. Community Boards remain the
primary source of information on the condition and needs of the neighborhoods and can
give the most knowledgeable input on the impact of changes on the local level.
• Environmental standards are insufficiently defined and, in some cases, missing
altogether.
• Current enforcement mechanisms are already sorely lacking, and it is hard to understand
how future methods will be funded or enforced. Community Board input and oversight
have been dramatically reduced through the:
o Increased number of as-of-right scenarios that bypass public hearing or input and,
o Elimination of ULURP even in instances of significant community impacts.
Therefore be it resolved that MCB2 recommends denial of COYEO in general and offers
the following concerns in particular:
1. Proposal #1: Reactivation of storefronts. MCB2 believes that the recommendations of
Community Boards where the impacts of these proposals would be more strongly felt
should be given serious and respectful consideration.
17 Joint Community Board letter requesting additional time to respond to COYEO:
(https://cbmanhattan.cityofnewyork.us/cb2/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/CYEOCBLetter2023.pdf)
Response from Commissioner Dan Garodnick: (https://cbmanhattan.cityofnewyork.us/cb2/wp-
content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/DCP-Response-to-CB-sign-on-letter-2023-11-15.pdf
222. Proposal #2: Simplify district types. MCB2 has no specific comments and believes that
the recommendations of community boards in which these proposals would be more
strongly felt and should be given serious and respectful consideration.
3. Proposal #3: Allow manufacturing to be located in commercial zones. This provision
turns C-zones into M-zones. MCB2 is skeptical of the relaxing of any standards related to
permitting manufacturing uses in commercial districts without strict environmental
standards and quality of life factors such as defining hours of operation and noise levels.
MCB2 is concerned that the types of manufacturing to be allowed in C-districts will
conflict with existing residences and businesses. The impacts of 24-hour “maker”
activities are and will be negative. Manufacturers should only make goods to be sold at
retail on the same premises and within regular business hours. We would prefer retaining
the current separation of maker uses from residential and mixed-use zones.
4. Proposal #4: Remove loading requirements in existing buildings. If the requirement for
loading docks is decreased, there should be a parallel requirement to provide more
interior on-site storage to reduce the chances of quality-of-life conflicts between residents
and businesses because of the noise and environmental impacts of more frequent
deliveries. The greater issue is the degradation of quality of life for the surrounding
residential units.
5. Proposal #5: Allow commercial uses above the ground floor in mixed-use buildings.
We support maintaining the principle of housing being physically above commercial. If
this passes, this particular proposal should be expressly limited to new construction
approved after the date of the COYEO text change as the issues involved in retrofitting
older buildings have not been sufficiently thought out. Additionally, we suggest
augmenting the 15-foot separation between business and residential to also include: a) not
sharing a common wall and b) not being directly above or below to mitigate sound issues
as a result of 24/7 commercial uses. As written this proposal is unacceptable because of
the negative impact on the quality of life.
6. Proposal #6: Rework the use group framework. This overhaul of the use groups
provides well-needed modernization but is an example of how a one-size-fits-all
approach does not work for MCB2. The new use group structure does not adequately
address the overall environmental impacts of certain use groups. For example, eating and
drinking being combined with other low impact uses is not helpful and the zoning text as
a whole does not introduce appropriate Environmental Standards or Performance
Standards to adequately create an appropriate framework with which to measure and
regulate associated quality of life impacts within the broad spectrum of eating and
drinking uses.
Additionally, the proposed text does not include Use Group 17D (JLWQA), which would
appear to be an error. If, however, this is not an error and the intent is to eliminate Use
Group 17D, then MCB2 is opposed to its removal.
237. Proposal #7: Urban agriculture. MCB2 has no specific comments and believes that the
recommendations of Community Boards where the impacts of these proposals would be
more strongly felt and should be given serious and respectful consideration.
8. Proposal #8: Change how zoning classifies and zones life sciences. MCB2 objects to
this proposal because it does not require registration of all life sciences facilities with the
Department of Health (DOH) nor publication of a list of facilities by address, including
whether or not a particular facility is hazardous.
9. Proposal #9: Allow nightclubs to locate in more places. MCB2 objects to this proposal
because it does not include environmental standards created with Community Board
input. MCB2 is struggling with the impact of nightlife on residential areas. We are
uncomfortable with undoing capacity limits. We are very concerned that noise,
vibrations, odors and other disturbances would negatively impact surrounding residences
and commercial establishments. These proposals will lessen our ability to curtail excesses
and they will further degrade the quality of life for our community, which is already
oversaturated with establishments like these.
10. Proposal #10: Allow amusements and rides to locate in more places. The proposal will
introduce two categories of amusements: “amusement or recreation facility,” (which
would allow uses like bowling, laser tag and arcades) and “amusement parks.” These
changes will allow amusements in more locations. This proposal represents a real
degradation of the quality of life in the community, and MCB2 does not support this
proposal.
11. Proposal #11: Expand home occupations. This change raises a number of quality of life
concerns. Home occupations are already problematic in our community district and
would become more so with this proposal. The proposal is flawed in that there is no cap
on the raw or percentage of square footage for a business or its related businesses, nor are
there limits on the number of home businesses in a single residential building (through
total number and/or percentage of units). The text change would not prohibit someone
from expanding a business into a neighboring apartment, setting up a conflict between
business uses and residential housing. The quality of life concerns with respect to
potentially unlimited customer traffic and/or business hours are highly problematic:
commercial uses bring new and more people into a building, which makes security more
difficult, and 24-hour commercial use in a mixed-use building needs careful evaluation.
Furthermore, the expectation that the Department of Buildings (DOB) will enforce these
rules is unreasonable and unattainable.
If Proposal #11 of COYEO passes the City Council, CB2 recommends the elimination of
the JLWQA conversion fee and Arts Fund enacted in the recent SoHo/NoHo rezoning.
We recommend retaining the current definitions and regulations of home occupations.
12. Proposal #12: Provide new and standardized urban design rules. MCB2 opposes any
changes to the rules for the Special Little Italy District (SLID) and thus opposes any part
of this proposal which would allow such changes. Replacing the use group for the SLID
24(Use Group LI) with the standardized use groups would not limit the new uses, such as
manufacturing, amusements and nightclubs. Due to this standardization, this special
district would be subject to businesses that decrease the quality of life and displace long-
standing local businesses that are essential to the special district. Furthermore, in the
SoHo/NoHo Special District, the just-approved streetscape rules are deleted entirely and
replaced with the standardized rules. MCB2 is opposed to any changes to ground floor
uses in the SLID.
The proposed text appears to contain a drafting error with respect to the ground floor uses
in the SLID and the SoHo/NoHo Mixed Use District. The map (Map1 in Appendix A of
Section 143-00 of the Zoning Resolution) needs to be either updated to clearly show what
streets qualify as Tier B and Tier C, or deleted in its entirety, if all streets now qualify as
Tier C. If kept, it should also delete references to “Primary Street Frontage (143-15(a))”
since that type of street and the referenced zoning section would no longer exist, if this
text were to pass.
13. Proposal #13: Auto repair. MCB2 has no specific comments and believes that the
recommendations of Community Boards where the impacts of these proposals would be
more strongly felt and should be given serious and respectful consideration.
14. Proposal #14: Permit micro-distribution facilities. MCB2 objects to permitting micro-
distribution facilities which are effectively dark stores. MCB2 believes that all retail
stores should be accessible to consumers to promote a vibrant retail streetscape.
15. Proposal #15: Campus commercial. MCB2 has no specific comments and believes that
the recommendations of community boards where the impacts of these proposals would
be more strongly felt and should be given serious and respectful consideration.
16. Proposal #16: Allows agency authorizations for “corner stores.” MCB2 objects to the
removal of the elected officials from the process of approval of “corner stores.” CPC will
have no required local, public input into such a change. A Community Board may submit
an opinion but there is no way to back up that opinion with required action by the City
Council. Community Boards and elected officials have been taken out of the loop on very
local questions. Instead of those with expert knowledge of an area having a participatory
and decision-making role, this proposal would make CPC the final and only arbiter.
17. Proposal #17: Allow special permits and authorizations for bulk and use without City
Council authorization. MCB2 opposes removing the role of the City Council from the
approval process as that would remove an important oversight step and reduce the
chances that storefronts might be combined without review.
18. Proposal #18: New loft-style district. MCB2 has no specific comments and believes that
the recommendations of Community Boards where the impacts of these proposals would
be more strongly felt and should be given serious and respectful consideration.

2. 388 Hudson Street Update: Presentation by the NYC Department of Housing
Preservation & Development on its community outreach and engagement.
Whereas:
1. On January 10, 2024, representatives of NYC Department of Housing Preservation and
Development (HPD) presented the results of the Community Visioning process for
affordable housing at 388 Hudson Street; and
2. MCB2 has written many resolutions in support of the proposed affordable housing at 388
Hudson Street.
Therefore be it resolved:
1. MCB2 reiterates the importance of a new, modern, multi-floor recreation center at the base of
the 388 Hudson Street building. There is no indoor, all-weather recreation space in our
community and this request has been made very clear from the start. The Board has never
advocated for a supermarket, particularly since the area already includes at least three
grocery stores in a walkable distance. Because HPD’s survey and workshop questions did not
specifically include a recreation center as one of the choices, this priority was not properly
reflected in the Community Visioning Report.
2. MCB2 demands a holistic approach to the design of 388 Hudson to reflect expertise in
architecture, urban design, engineering, sustainability, and historic preservation.
Like the GSA Design Excellence program, this project should include guiding principles as
part of the planning document to ensure quality design and construction. Along with the
project requirements, the planning document should include the selection process of the lead
designer and design firm. The GSA Design Excellence program relies on and advocates for a
qualified group of professional peers that are involved in selecting the design firms and
critique the project throughout.
An exceptional site for exceptional use deserves an exceptional building. This building lies
on the border of low-rise buildings of Greenwich Village to the north and Hudson Square
with tall buildings to the south. The building should take advantage of this boundary and
respond architecturally to both. We need the finest architects and engineers to create beauty
and inspire pride for now and future generations.
263. MCB2 continues to ask the city to build on the entire footprint of the 388 Hudson housing
site and eliminate the currently proposed setback of approximately 10 feet on the south side
of the lot. MCB2 recommends that part of the planning for this site should be a careful
analysis of the requirements for maintenance and repair on the DEP site. Then HPD can
negotiate with DEP to integrate the two sides of the lot, to help maximize housing and create
a focal point with a beautiful three-dimensional space yet still satisfy the DEP’s
requirements. It is worth the effort. Cantilevers and large openings combined with a well-
functioning DEP site would benefit the project. Even with cantilever, the south facade would
still benefit from low sun in winter and partial shade in summer. A creative design should
integrate the lots and provide a south facade that is not a sheer straight razor cut face and
would erase the straight line between the north and south sides of the property.
4. MCB2 reiterates that HPD and DEP work together to create more space for as much housing
as possible.
5. MCB2 reserves the right to comment further on the Community Visioning Report and the
project in general.

Sanz).

282. Iaccas Corp dba Old Fashion Cafe 110 Thompson 10012 (OP–Restaurant) (Change in
Method of Operation)
i. Whereas, the Applicant and the Applicant’s Attorney appeared before Community Board 2,
Manhattan’s SLA Licensing Committee #1 to present an application for a Change in Method
of Operation to the existing On-Premises Restaurant license (SN#0340-23-136034, legacy
#1348100, exp 3/31/2025) to continue to operate a café and bistro in the non-conforming
basement space of a six (6)-story, residential walk-up building (c. 1900, zoned R7-2) on
Thompson Street between Spring and Prince Streets (Block #502 / Lot #12), the building
falling within NYC’s LPC-designated Sullivan-Thompson Historic District; and
ii. Whereas, the premises is in a 750 sq. ft. cellar space accessed via a sidewalk stairway, there
are 10 tables and 31 seats, one (1) stand up bar with four (4) seats for a total seated occupancy
of 35, there are no TVs, there is a full service kitchen, one (1) bathroom and one (1)
entrance/exit for patron ingress and egress; and
iii. Whereas, the Applicant has been operating since Fall/2022, the current closing hours being
12 AM Sundays through Thursdays and 1 AM Fridays and Saturdays, the change in method
of operation is to close an hour later each night (1 AM closing Sundays through Thursdays
and 2 AM Fridays and Saturdays); music will remain quiet background only consisting of
music from iPod/CDs; there will be no dancing, DJs, live music, promoted events, scheduled
performances or cover fees, velvet ropes or movable barriers, security personnel or doorman;
and
iv. Whereas, the immediate residential neighborhood is currently saturated with licensed
premises with 55 active licenses listed on LAMP within 750 feet of the instant application;
the Applicant stating when they originally appeared before CB2, Manhattan in June/2022 that
they were a restaurant and would have a limited number of cocktails in order for patrons to
have a drink with their dinner and they would not operate as a bar or lounge; the change in
method of operation for the later hours are not in alignment with restaurant hours or the
residential community within which they are located, the Applicant themselves stating that
the other neighboring restaurants close at midnight or earlier and that they want to stay open
later to provide a place for people to go for their last cocktail, the later hours raising significant
concerns that the operation will be that of a bar rather than a restaurant, the Applicant’s
website prominently featuring their cocktail menu before their food menu and spotlighting
cocktail bar awards, the Applicant stating that they currently have a problem getting patrons
to leave promptly by 1 AM as they’ve recently ordered a drink, their website currently
showing closing hours of 1 AM, 7 days a week despite the Applicant signing stipulations of
12 AM closing Sundays through Thursdays (thereby operating in derogation of their agreed
upon stipulations), the Applicant at the time of executing their stipulations understanding that
closing hours means all patrons out and not last call; and
v. Whereas, when the Applicant came to CB2 a year and a half ago for their initial license they
asked for closing hours of 12 AM weekdays and 1 AM weekends, those hours meeting the
29needs of their business model and being later than most of the other nearby restaurants, this
immediate area being a residentially only-zoned neighborhood with concerns being raised that
the method of operation need to be that of a restaurant and not of a bar, the premises falling
midblock on a residential street, the Applicant signing stipulations agreeing that all patrons
would be out by those hours in order to meet the public interest standard of their On-Premises
Liquor license, nothing has substantively changed since that time, the premises remains
surrounded by residences in an area where new licenses are continuously coming before
Community Board 2, the requested later hours being better suited to a commercial area and
not mid-block on a narrow residential street; and
vi. Whereas, included in the initial application was sidewalk seating consisting of two (2) tables
and four (4) chairs as part of the temporary Open Restaurants program, the premises being
below grade and therefore not eligible for the program as it applied to ground floor premises
only, this being a residentially-zoned neighborhood with narrow sidewalks where outdoor
seating had never previously been permitted, the outdoor seating of nearby eating and drinking
establishments already having had negative quality of life impacts for residents, the Applicant
agreeing that they would remove outdoor seating from their application and signing
stipulations agreeing to the same as part of meeting the public interest, yet the Applicant has
been operating in derogation of those stipulations and has two (2) tables and four (4) seats on
the sidewalk above their premises; and
vii. Whereas, in addition, at the time of the initial application in June/2022 it was pointed out that
there was a discrepancy between the provided Letter of No Objection (dated July 13, 2012)
permitting an eating and drinking establishment on the first (1st) floor of the licensed premises
and the lease for the subject licensed premises dated April 1, 2022 which is for the basement
retail space, it being unclear if an eating and drinking establishment is permitted in the
basement of the premises, the Applicant being asked to provide a new Letter of No Objection
at the time for the basement of the licensed premises and to date has failed to do so; and
viii. Whereas, some members of the local community came to support the application while at the
same time stating that patrons leaving the premises and mingling outside at closing creates a
disturbance, other residents wrote opposing any extension of hours and addressing the change
in what had been a relatively quiet residential block which has seen the addition of more
restaurants to the area and more open doors and windows creating a negative quality of life
impact on the residents in this residential area and asking that a balance be maintained
between the needs of the residents and those of the businesses; and
ix. Whereas, the Applicant is currently not abiding by the previously agreed-to hours of 12 AM
closing Sunday through Thursday, the current late night exiting of patrons already causing a
disturbance to residents, the current hours already being later than surrounding restaurants,
there being no lack of restaurants and/or bars in this residential neighborhood and the
surrounding commercial area (this location being in the residential district), the Applicant
providing no compelling reason for why this restaurant should have bar hours with it being
located mid-block on a residential street further exacerbating quality of life issues; and
30THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that CB2, Man. recommends denial of the Change in Method
of Operation Application for Iaccas Corp dba Old Fashion Cafe 110 Thompson 10012; and
THEREFORE BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that should this application be considered by
the NYSLA, CB2, Man. respectfully requests that this item be calendared to appear before the Full
Board of the NYSLA before any Change in Method of Operation to the existing On-Premises
Liquor License is issued to this Applicant.

operation when he originally appeared in December/2022; and
viii. Whereas, questions were also raised regarding the roadbed structure that is in front of the
premises, the Applicant stating it does not belong to him but to the tea shop next door, Paquita,
which is closed by the time his restaurant is open, the landlord permitting them to have a
roadbed structure in front of his restaurant which the Applicant stated had nothing to do with
him; upon further information from community members it is disclosed that the tea shop
belongs to his business partner’s sister, calling into question the transparency of the instant
application; and
ix. Whereas, members of the community were in strong opposition to the application for an on
premise full liquor license, asserting a bait and switch scheme, the Applicant just a year ago
presenting strictly a wine and beer application with daytime food service, the instant
43application consisting of an increase in evening hours, no daytime food service and an upgrade
to their liquor license to serve spirits — this being a different business model from what was
presented to the community just a year ago, this also being in contrast to other applications
presented to the committee where the applicants state they are coming for beer and wine at
this time in order to get a temporary license quickly because the backlog at the NYSLA
prevents applicants from getting a temporary license the Applicant in this case previously
denying an intention to seek an On-Premises license after being open for less than one year,
the service of beer and wine fitting with the daytime and early dinner focus of his
café/restaurant with that model having the support of the local community based on those
representations; and
x. Whereas, members of the community were also in opposition to having any outdoor seating
at this location, the Applicant having agreed to no outdoor seating, just a year ago, the location
being on a narrow, residentially only-zoned street with a sidewalk of approximately 10' and
no room for sidewalk seating, the Applicant not providing measurements of the sidewalk
width in the application presented, the seating requested with the instant application being an
increase of 100% in total # of seats, there being no prior service of alcohol in the residentially-
zoned neighborhood located on a one-way, narrow roadway; and
xi. Whereas, the area within a block of the instant application already has a large number of
licensed establishments serving dinner and offering drinks such as:
• 518 Hudson Street LLC dba Justines (SN#0340-23-128342, Legacy SN#1338435)
• Hudson Corner LLC dba B’Artusi/Via Porta (SN#0340-23-138710, Legacy SN#1334758),
• Cowgirl Inc dba Cowgirl & Bar (SN# 0340-23-131639, Legacy SN#1025508)
• 228 West 10th Street LLC dba L’Artusi (SN#0340-230132610, Legacy SN#1217898),
• RF Hudson (DE) LLC dba Redfarm (SN# 0340-23-137345, Legacy SN#1251196),
• Alfred B Hospitality LLC dba Katana Kitten (SN#0340-22-113564, Legacy #1305298)
and others; and
xii Whereas, the instant application has not offered/is not offering the important daytime
service of breakfast and lunch as was part of their original application a year ago; and
xiii. Whereas, despite stating in December/2022 that they would be filing for a Letter of No
Objection permitting eating and drinking at the premises, they currently do not have one; the
Applicant stated at the time of the initial application in December/2022 that cooking would
be electric only, there would be no open flame cooking; following this month’s CB2
committee meeting it was discovered that there was a complaint made in July/2023 regarding
venting of the ground floor restaurant, with cooking smells going into adjacent apartments
and grease present on apartment windows and building shaft way, DOB issuing a violation
for work without a permit at the 1st floor restaurant “West 10 West” (Oath/ECB Violation
#39090615L), that violation remains open; and
xiv. Whereas, this application being subject to the 500 Foot Rule requiring the Applicant to
demonstrate that the public interest would be served by the addition of another On-Premises
Liquor License at this location, the Applicant having operated for less than one year, the
Applicant not previously holding a liquor license, the storefront in question never previously
44operating with an On-Premises Liquor License, there being 72 active licensed premises
within 750 feet of the location proposed to be licensed, with 8 additional pending licenses, the
Applicant not presenting a method of operation serving breakfast, lunch and dinner consistent
with his Restaurant Wine application, the operator never actually operating in the manner in
which he presented his original application no more than one year ago, the Applicant going
back on his commitments that were to the Community and local block association , the service
of alcohol to the exterior on a residential block having significant impacts on those living in
the area, there being nothing unique about the instant application to illustrate that it is in the
public interest to have another On-Premises Liquor License in this area, the immediate
location being residentially zoned, the surrounding area already being heavily saturated with
liquor licenses, the Applicant not obtaining the proper permits from the NYC DOB for eating
and drinking for the premises of the instant application; and
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that Community Board 2, Manhattan recommends denial of
the application for a new On-Premises Restaurant Liquor License for West 10West LLC dba
West 10West 242 W 10th St 10014; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that should this application be considered by the SLA, CB2,
Manhattan respectfully requests that this item be calendared to appear before the Full Board of the
SLA.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that should the applicant pursue this application despite CB2,
Manhattan’s recommendation to deny this application, CB2 requests that the SLA conduct an in
person 500-foot hearing so that local residents are able to participate fully in the process now that
the COVID emergency has ended.

Whereas, the applicant had not yet conducted outreach to the residents living in the building
above Da Nico but promised to do so; and
Whereas, while CB2, Man. notes the short running time for the event which is a factor that
reduces overall neighborhood impact, concerns were expressed around the crowding on the
sidewalk which is likely to occur during the expected hour of talent drop-off; and
Whereas, CB2, Man. would have liked to have more time to provide input and suggestions for
how to handle sidewalk congestion during this activation, but due to SAPO rules requiring that
“small” street events be submitted only a minimum of 14 days before the event, CB2’s SAR
committee was only able to hear the details of this event two days before the event was
scheduled, with no opportunity for CB2, Man.’s full board to opine; now
Therefore Be It Resolved that CB2, Man. recommends approval of Talent Drop off and Red
Carpet Da Nico’s (Sponsor: Civic), Mulberry St. bet. Broome & Grand St. [sidewalk &

with 4 or 5 electric grills (no open flames) and staff passing out up to 600 grilled cheese

53Whereas, the applicant intends to have additional garbage receptacles on site in order to deal
with any waste generated by the activation; and
Whereas¸ the proposed location for the event typically sees heavy pedestrian traffic, being
around the corner from a subway entrance; and
Whereas, furthermore, the proposed curb lane closure would encompass a “right turn only” lane
for vehicles turning right from Broadway onto Canal, with “No Standing Anytime” signage, and
closing this curb lane would cause a safety risk as well as contribute to traffic problems such as
forcing right turning vehicles into a bus-only lane; now
Therefore Be It Resolved that CB2, Man. recommends denial of Daiya Fromage Grilled

V. STANDING COMMITTEE REPORTS WITH RESOLUTIONS
LANDMARKS AND PUBLIC AESTHETICS
1. *588 Broadway – Application is to install a flag and flagpole.
Whereas:
A. The flag is to be installed on a horizontal pole to the right of the shop entrance; and
B. The flag, 5’ X 10’ is bright red with modest lettering; and is mounted on a horizontal pole; and

disturb the fabric of the building and that it is found by the Commission to conform to all applicable
regulations concerning advertising flags in the district and for this building; and

plan; and
A. The applicant seeks to have the master plan vacated and to perform the alterations specified in this
application; and

B. Approval of the historic restoration of the facades including windows, cornice and maintaining
the separation of the several stores.
Vote: Unanimous, with 37 Board members in favor.
4. *16 Jones St. – Application is to construct a new rooftop addition & expand the existing cellar by
excavating and recovering the courtyard.
Whereas:
A. The rooftop addition is 37’ x 20’ and 12’ high, set well back from the street and is not visible from
any public thoroughfare; and
B. The courtyard will be excavated with a retaining wall built on the south side within the property line
and partial underpinning on the north side and will then be restored to maintain the existing
appearance; and
C. The applicant represented that engineering studies have been carried out concerning the underpinning
to ensure that the integrity of the property and the neighboring property will be maintained and that
engineers for the neighboring property have approved the proposal.
D. The application includes plans for a rooftop garden on the back building, with very little information
regarding configuration and intended use of space, and the applicant represented that a spray booth
vent indicated in the section as dangerously close to a neighboring residential property, was no longer
part of the proposal.
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:
A. Approval of the rooftop addition; and
7B. Approval of the excavation provided that the Commission verifies the engineering reports
concerning safety and underpinning and that care is taken to preserve the integrity of the subject
property and the neighboring properties.

A. The sensitive, historic restoration of the front façade is to be approved by Commission staff; and
B. Planter boxes are to be attached in the mortar joints at the parlor and second floors; and
C. There is an existing enclosed porch extension in poor condition on the rear façade that is proposed to
be demolished and replaced; and
D. The new extension, in fire- resistant synthetic wood in deep green with large windows, covers an
extensive portion of the rear facade and includes French doors on the ground and parlor levels; and
E. The top floor rear window is to be reconfigured into two smaller windows maintaining the existing
design.
Now therefore be it resolve that CB2, Man. recommends:
A. Approval of the front window boxes provided that they are secured into mortar joints and do not
disturb historic fabric; and
B. Approval of the demolition of the existing rear extension; and
C. Approval of the sensitive design of the new extension, which does not compromise the historic
building’s integrity and lies well within the doughnut.
Vote: Unanimous, with 37 Board members in favor.
6. *675 Hudson St. – Application is to restore the façade, modify ground-floor openings and install
new storefront infill, replace windows, install painted signage; enlarge an existing elevator
bulkhead and install new rooftop mechanical units.
Whereas:
A. The building is a prominent triangular building, originally built as the south portion of the existing
building and later united with a newer triangular northern extension and, rather unusual for the
district, retains is intact historic design and is placed at the gateway to the Gansevoort district on 9th
Avenue and Hudson Street; and
8B. The spandrels on the original rectilinear portion of the building were painted in typical subdued
colors with uniform lettering to identify businesses within the building; and
C. The triangular extension from the 1800s, the addition of a cornice in the early 20th century, as well as
a colorful facade in the 1960’s (now painted over in a brick color) and a variety of changes to the
uniform storefronts over the years present a historically intact, very different building from the
original foursquare manufacturing building; and
D. Numerous masonry details will be restored; and
E. The storefronts are proposed to be rebuilt with four versions of a uniform contemporary design in
black metal which is not appropriate in a situation in which the original openings exist and the entire
building is otherwise in a historic state; and
F. The applicant made an odd assertion that the 9th Avenue facade, facing into the historic district,
should have piers removed to form larger bays similar to other buildings in the district with more
open bays at the base, yet many of the examples cited were in buildings where larger openings such
as loading docks and garage doors existed in the original building or examples in buildings that were
newly constructed; and
G. It was further asserted that the Hudson Street facade, facing outside the district should have its
original storefront bays preserved and that the changes to the 9th Avenue facade were justified in that
it faced into the district; and
H. The cornice will be reproduced in fiberglass and extends around the three sides of the building; and
I. There will be two principal entrances, one on each side facade, and numerous entrances for the
several stores; and
J. The canopies above the building entrances are modern, without historic reference, and are especially
objectionable in that they form a transition from the street floor to the intact second floor; and
K. There are signs with rounded edges that have a historically inspired feeling above the building and
store entrances and similar smaller signs at the store entrances; and
L. A necessary enlargement of the elevator shaft on 9th Avenue and new rooftop mechanical equipment
are as unobtrusive as possible and similar to those on many buildings in the district.
M. A large and prominently placed rooftop sign existed before designation of the district and is therefore
permitted to remain; and
N. The spandrel sign bands in the original part of the building were in a subdued color with uniform
lettering identifying the tenants of the building and there are numerous examples illustrating this use
from records and extant; and
O. With the northern triangular addition to the building, the spandrels are much more prominent.
P. Though there was use of the spandrels as sign bands, limited to a time in the 19th century, in the
original building, the current proposal gives undue prominence to the spandrels. The original effect
of the painted sign bands is changed from being an integral part of a differently shaped and smaller
9building, to something else entirely and the increased area, with a high contrast off-white background
and a presumed variety of fonts, colors, and logos, moves away from the historic painted spandrels
being an integral part of the building and contributing to its unity , and instead favors bold,
decorative elements that serve to interrupt the vertical thrust of the building by dividing the floors as
thick “frosting” between the “layers” of the building; and
Q. Members of the public spoke in opposition to the application.
Now therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:
A. Approval of the masonry restoration, windows above the ground floor, signage at the ground floor,
reproduced cornice, mechanical equipment, and elevator bulkhead; and
B. Denial of the modern steel ground floor window systems, and the building entrance canopies as
being without the historic reference; and
C. Denial of the removal of piers in historic material to enlarge the west show windows which
unacceptably compromise the integrity of the otherwise intact historic design of the building; and
D. Denial of the painted sign bands as asserting themselves in a way that transforms the building into a
background for sign bands and transforms the vertical expression of the facades to a horizontal
expression of alternating sign bands and the windows of each story.
E. That if modified version of the proposed sign bands is proposed that it come before CB2, Man. for a
public hearing.
Vote: Passed, with 36 Board members in favor, and 1 abstention (R. Kessler).
7. *302 W. 13th St. – Application is to convert a three-family residence to a single-family residence,
replace/modify windows on the facades, expand the bulkhead and other facade modifications.
Whereas:
A. The building, originally a commercial building, is of an unusual triangular configuration at a
prominent corner with two facades having lot line windows and has undergone considerable
modification; and
B. The facade windows are to be restored to two over two and lengthened to their original height
indicated clearly by unlatching filler brick and intact sills, and the 13th Street cornice is to be
replicated; and
C. The ground floor is to be modified in a manner intended to reflect the building’s commercial
history; and
D. The applicant proposes to remove an intact painted “ghost sign”, more of which is likely behind
metal cladding that is to be removed on the spandrel and others may be uncovered behind metal
cladding which is to be removed.
E. A highly visible and modern penthouse incorporating the existing stair bulkhead is not
complimentary to the building and contains a considerable amount of glass; and
10F. The required safety railing above the penthouse is highly visible and its black color amplifies the
visibility; and
G. The position of the building on an open corner ensures that any rooftop addition will be highly
visible; and
H. A member of the public spoke in opposition to the application.
Therefore Be it Resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:
A. Approval of the facade restoration, apart from the ghost sign, and approval of the lengthening of the
windows to their original height, the addition of the historic cornice; and
B. Denial of the removal of the ghost sign as an important reference to the era of painted wall signs and
identification of the building’s commercial past; and
C. Denial of the penthouse as far more than the standard in Greenwich Village as “not more than
minimally visible’ for a rooftop addition and any other rooftop structure that is more than a modest
enlargement of the existing stair bulkhead.
Vote: Passed, with 36 Board members in favor, and 1 abstention (R. Kessler).
MOTION TO TABLE
A motion to table the resolutions from the SLA-2 Committee, Cannabis Licensing Committee, and the
Outdoor Dining Working Group based on the timing of the availability of those resolutions for review did
was not adopted.
Vote: Did not pass, with 6 in favor (A. Brenna, C. Dignes, M. Metzger, R. Kessler, Z. Roberts, R. Sanz),
31 opposed, 0 abstaining and 0 ineligible.
OUTDOOR DINING WORKING GROUP
1. Resolution regarding Dining Out NYC Regulations for Sidewalk Cafes
Whereas:
1. Local Law 121 of 2023 (the “legislation”) establishes a permanent outdoor dining program,
Dining Out NYC, to be administered by the New York City Department of Transportation
(NYCDOT);
2. Dining Out NYC will replace the Temporary Open Restaurants Program, including a transition
period for eating and drinking establishment operators to apply for the permanent program;
3. NYCDOT has proposed rules (the “regulations”) to administer, govern, and oversee Dining Out
NYC and the transition from the Temporary Open Restaurants Program (the “temporary
program”) to Dining Out NYC;
4. The regulations would set requirements for sidewalk cafes, including rules about licenses, design,
operations, and enforcement;
5. Outdoor seating should be a complement to the interior seating, of an eating and drinking
establishment, not be the main focal point visually or economically;
11General Requirements: Sidewalk Cafe
Definition of a Sidewalk Cafe
6. The regulations do not clearly define the location of a sidewalk cafe as being adjacent to a
building and a building line of a ground-floor restaurant;
Definition of and Context within a Historic District
7. The regulations reference “historic districts” but do not define what a historic district is;
8. The regulations reference what is physically attached to a building within a historic district;
9. Designation reports for historic districts specifically include the streetscape as contributing
criteria;
Landmark Preservation Commission Review
10. The regulations indicate that LPC has to make a determination on a sidewalk cafe application
within 10 business days from receipt of a complete application;
11. The regulations indicate that a public hearing is required if LPC determines that such a sidewalk
cafe may have an effect on the exterior architectural features of a landmark or a building or
buildings within a historic district;
Blanket Waiver of the Regulations
12. The regulations allow the Commissioner to waive any part of the Dining Out NYC regulations in
the interest of public safety and convenience;
13. The regulations define “Commissioner” as the Commissioner of Transportation, or their
authorized designee;
Revocable Consent Requirements for Sidewalk Cafes
Community Board Review
14. The Community Board Review period is 40 days for sidewalk cafes;
15. Operators with sidewalk café licenses from the previous sidewalk cafe program (dating before
March 2020) are required to reapply for Dining Out NYC;
Site Plan and Drawings: Trash Containers
16. The regulations require a site plan comprised of an accurate drawing depicting required
clearances, the spaces to be occupied, and the locations of tables, chairs, barriers, and vertical
elements for the sidewalk cafe;
17. The Department of Sanitation (DSNY) requires food-related businesses to use rigid containers (55
gallons or less) with secure lids for putrescible waste;
18. DSNY also now requires all commercial businesses to use rigid containers (55 gallons or less)
with secure lids for putrescible waste;
19. Staring November 1, 2023, all business improvement districts (BID) are required to use rigid
containers (55 gallons or less) with secure lids for all waste picked up by the BID if the BID will
not drop off garbage bags at their local sanitation district garage;
20. Starting in 2024, DSNY will require all residential buildings with nine (9) or fewer units to use
rigid containers (55 gallons or less) with secure lids for putrescible waste;
21. The Dining Out NYC regulations do not require eating and drinking establishment operators to
outline in their site plan or drawing where they intend to store the rigid containers or “receptacles
with form-fitting lids” (as referenced in the regulations) when in use for active pick-up from a
commercial carter and when not in use for storage purposes or where, if applicable, other
12commercial or residential tenants of the same building will place their containers for pickup or
store their containers in the immediate vicinity of the eating and drinking establishment.
Design Requirements // Siting Requirements: Sidewalk Cafes
Clear Path
22. CB2 applauds the use of the NYCDOT Pedestrian Mobility Plan, which outlines four corridor
categories of street types (Baseline, Community Connector, Regional Corridor, and Global
Corridor) in the regulations. Clear path requirements for each street type are outlined in the
regulations.
a. The regulations indicate that sidewalk cafes located on Regional Corridors have a 10-foot
clear path requirement, however, the clear path requirement can be reduced to 8 feet if
“maintenance of a 10-foot clear path after installation of such a sidewalk cafe is not
feasible.”
i. Examples of Regional Corridor streets that in CB2:
1. Bleecker St. from 6th Ave. to Bowery
2. Christopher St. from Hudson St. to 6th Ave.
3. MacDougal St. from W Houston St. to West 4th St./Washington Square S
St.
4. Mulberry St. from E Houston St. to Canal St.
5. Carmine St. from Varick St. to 6th Ave.
6. West 8th St. from 6th Ave. to 5th Ave.
ii. This means that smaller side streets in CB2 that are classified as Regional Corridors
would have the same clear path requirement as other Regional Corridor streets such
as Hudson St., Seventh Ave., and Sixth Ave.

PARKS & WATERFRONT
A Resolution Opposing the Removal of the Climbing Wall at DeSalvio Playground
WHEREAS:
1. A mini rock-climbing wall that was installed in the southwest corner of DeSalvio Playground at
Spring and Mulberry Streets has to be removed because of a lawsuit filed by the building next to
the park; and
2. The feature was proposed by the then-serving City Councilmember in 2013, the design was
finished in 2015, $1.9M was allocated to building it in fiscal year 2017, and it finally opened in
2018 and became a popular feature for the children in our community who’d waited many years
for this park’s renovation; and
3. A condominium building at 75 Kenmare was constructed after the wall was installed and was
designed so that its windows came to abut the park and the top of the climbing wall, providing
climbers access to the windowsill and balcony of the building, and
4. This has created safety issues for the children, and gave rise to a lawsuit initiated by the building
over privacy;
5. Although the wall’s construction preceded that of the condominium building, the burden of
addressing these issues has fallen to the Parks Department, which has been unable to limit access
from the wall to the building without incurring great additional construction costs, and so has
decided that the climbing wall needs to be removed, and
296. Our committee and the community are upset about the loss of the feature.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that Manhattan Community Board 2:
1. Understands that the Parks Department has been given no choice but to demolish the climbing
wall but feels that this amenity – which our community supported, scoped, advocated for, and
waited for for five years – should not have to be demolished to accommodate a property owner
that was aware of this public structure before it chose the design of its private building.
2. Strongly recommends that the building owners pay to address this slight to our community by
providing funding – either to build a structure that prevents climbing to the top of the wall, or to
relocate the wall to another suitable location in our district, or at a minimum, make an equivalent
donation to the Parks Department.

8. Resolution in response to proposed rule changes at CECM / SAPO regarding Open Culture
Events, street events on Open Streets, and a continued moratorium on new multi-block
street fairs.
Whereas, The Mayor’s Office of Citywide Event Coordination and Management (CECM), of which
SAPO is a sub-office, is establishing rules for the Open Culture Program, and about Open Street Events
and street fairs, which can be found at the following link: https://rules.cityofnewyork.us/wp-
content/uploads/2023/10/SAPO-Proposed-Rules-re-Permits-for-Open-Culture-Open-Streets-Programs-
Extension-of-Street-Fair-Moratorium-Preliminarily-Certified-10.18.23.pdf; and
Whereas, CECM will be holding a public hearing on the proposed rules changes at 9:00 AM on Monday,
November 20th, 2023, with all written comments due ahead of this date; and
Whereas, the proposed rules changes fall into three categories:
(1) Establishment of Rules for a permanent Open Culture program (per LL 80 of 2023)
(2) Specific rules for Street Events held on Open Streets
(3) Continuation of moratorium on new multi-block street fairs
Establishment of rules for a permanent Open Culture Program
33Whereas¸ Section 2509 of the Charter as added by Local Law No. 80 of 2023 directs CECM to establish
an Open Culture Program, pursuant to which an eligible art and cultural institution may utilize a roadway
for an artistic or cultural event; and
Whereas, the law further directs CECM to establish eligibility and use guidelines and policies for such
program and promulgate any necessary rules; and
Whereas, CECM is proposing a definition for an “Open Culture Event” that defines such an event as an
event including, but not limited to, cultural performances, rehearsals, and classes, that is free and open to
the public and offers free services or information to the community; and
Whereas, the proposed rule changes also eliminate prior language referring to the temporary Open
Culture Program that existed in the aftermath of COVID and was required to take place on specific “Open
Culture Streets”; and
Whereas¸ the rules propose that Open Culture Events will be subject to a $25 processing fee and must be
submitted to SAPO 15 or more days before the event; and
Whereas¸ CB2, Man. supports the use of roadway space for cultural events, but wants to make sure that
the language clarifies that not only are such events free and open to the public, but also that no items
would be for sale at such events as well; and
Whereas, CB2, Man. also believes that an earlier application deadline would be necessary in order to
ensure that CB2 has the opportunity to review all proposed events; and
Specific Rules for Street Events Held on Open Streets
Whereas¸ CECM’s proposed rule changes also define the concept of an “Open Street Event”, which is
essentially any sort of regular street event occurring on an Open Street; and
Whereas, CECM also introduces the concept of an “Open Street Partner”, which is already defined
elsewhere in the city Rules, but is essentially the organization or group approved by DOT to manage the
Open Street; and
Whereas¸ the proposed rule changes would require that proposed “Open Street Events” would allow for
the Open Street Partner to review and submit recommendations for approval or denial of the proposed
events; and
Whereas¸ applicants for Open Street Events would have 5 days to file comments with SAPO in the event
of a recommended denial or approval with conditions from the Open Street Partner; and
Whereas¸ such rules being proposed for Open Street Events broadly align with existing SAPO rules
which govern Plaza Events, with the Open Street Partner being treated similarly to a Plaza Partner for
Plaza Events; and
Whereas, CB2, Man. generally sees the value of improving the Open Street Partner in the approval
process for proposed events on Open Streets, in order to help ensure that such Open Streets remain
broadly available for the passive enjoyment of the public, and not overtaken by too many events; and
34Whereas, despite seeing the general value of such a process, CB2, Man. has some concern regarding
potential conflicts of interest with regard to Open Street Partners, such as if such partner is a for profit
business (e.g., restaurant) tasked with approving events proposed by competing businesses; and
Moratorium on new Multi-Block Street Fairs
Whereas, CECM is proposing to extend a moratorium on new multi-block street fairs that has already
been in place for the last several years; and
Whereas¸ CB2, Man. continues to support such a moratorium given the overabundance of such multi-
block fairs in Community District 2 and the corresponding impact on NYPD resources, and would further
support a study of existing multi-block fairs already in place; now
Therefore be it Resolved that with regard to the rules changes relating to Open Culture Events, CB2,
Man. proposes that the language be tweaked to ensure that no items may be sold at such events, and that
the deadline for submission of such events to SAPO be extended to 30 days before the event rather than
15 days; and
Therefore be it Further Resolved that with regard to the rules changes relating to Open Street Events,
CB2, Man. proposes that CECM include additional language to provide guidance around how to manage
potential conflicts of interest between Open Street Partners and applicants for Open Street Events; and
Therefore be it Finally Resolved that CB2, Man. supports the moratorium on new multi-block street
fairs and would further support a study of existing multi-block fairs already in place.

i. Whereas, the Applicant and the Applicant’s Attorney appeared before Community Board 2,
Manhattan’s SLA Committee #1 to present an application to the NYS Liquor Authority for a new
Tavern Wine license in a boutique hotel to operate a “food and beverage oasis” without a kitchen in
the Courtyard and rear art studio on the ground floor of a M1-5B zoned, five (5)-story, 14 room
boutique hotel (c. 1825, renovated 2012) on Broome Street between Crosby Street and Broadway
(Block #473 / Lot #31), the building falling within NYC LPC’s designated SoHo-Cast Iron Historic
District and the Special SoHo-NoHo Mixed Use District; and
ii. Whereas, the premises to be licensed is approximately 1,108 sq. ft. (675 sq. ft. in the exterior courtyard
and 433 sq. ft. in the interior art studio); there will be four (4) tables and 12 seats and one counter with
6 seats in the interior art studio premises and 19 tables and 40 seats in the courtyard for a total seated
occupancy of 58 persons,; there are two (2) entryways serving as both patron ingress and egress and
two (2) bathrooms located in the hotel lobby; the interior Courtyard being accessed by passing through
the hotel lobby and the interior space being past the Courtyard; and
iii. Whereas, the hours of operation will be from 7 AM to 12 AM Sundays through Thursdays and 7 AM
to 1 AM Fridays and Saturdays for the Courtyard and 7 AM to 12 PM Sundays through Thursdays and
7 AM to 1 AM Fridays and Saturdays for the interior licensed premises, the courtyard closing to
patrons but remaining open as a means of ingress and egress to the interior licensed premises; music
will be background only with speakers located both throughout the Courtyard and the interior premises,
there may be live acoustic music once a month on the interior; there will be no dancing, DJs, no
promoted events, no scheduled performances or cover fees, no velvet ropes, no movable barriers; and
iv. Whereas, the building had been previously occupied by artist joint live work quarters with five loft
units on the upper floors and a plumber’s shop on the ground floor. But was gut renovated in 2012 and
converted to Hotel uses on the second, third and fourth floors and the ground floor was converted to a
hotel lobby space in the front, large courtyard in the middle and Art Studio / Art Storage located in the
rear on the ground floor, at the time of the conversion, ground floor eating and drinking uses were
expressly prohibited in the zoning district; the Hotel originally opened in 2014; and
v. Whereas, there is no ground floor retail space currently located in the building and the certificate of
occupancy permits an Art Studio and Art Storage on the ground floor but does not permit Eating and
Drinking uses on any floor of the building; the Art Studio and Art Storage Use Group in the zoning
40text being an expressly separate use group from that which includes Eating and Drinking Uses, And an
Art Studio and Art Storage Space not having any accessory use that CB2 is aware of being utilized as
a food and beverage operation without a kitchen to service a boutique hotel; and
vi. Whereas, despite there being no permit in place to operate a retail eating and drinking establish on the
premises, the Applicant proposes and seeks to open up and advertise a tavern on the first floor for its
boutique hotel guests but also for the general public with tables and chairs throughout the interior and
service to their outdoor courtyard space which also includes tables and chairs until Midnight Sundays
through Thursdays and 1 AM Fridays and Saturdays serving snacks but without any kitchen, the
provided menu showing flatbreads, salads, charcuterie but no breakfast menu; additionally they intend
to hold private parties in the courtyard and the interior art studio space; and
vii. Whereas, the Courtyard is also surrounded by residential apartments immediately above overlooking
the interior courtyard and adjacent to said Courtyard, the surrounding residents in a previous license
application in 2015 which was not pursued providing photos showing the closeness in proximity of
their bedroom windows surrounding the courtyard space planned for eating and drinking, their
concerns of a significant increase of a noisy, late night and day time encroachment echoing against the
surrounding building walls and up to the residences for what has always been for them a place of
comfort, privacy and quiet, some of which have resided in these apartments for their lifetime; and
viii. Whereas, the Applicant, who also owns the building and is therefore a part of the community, only
did outreach via phone to a decades-long defunct block association no longer listed on CB2’s website,
the Applicant’s Attorney and his firm being very familiar with CB2, Man. and CB2’s desire for
outreach to the local block associations prior to our meetings, the request being specifically addressed
on CB2’s application materials, the Attorney and his firm being directly familiar with those local block
associations having been appearing before CB2, Man. on almost a monthly basis for decades, the
Attorney choosing not to reach out to the two active block associations in the area who he is familiar
with, those block associations being equipped to do further outreach to the community regarding the
application, the Attorney stating that on a beer and wine application that is not subject to the 500 Foot
Rule their firm having a different standard of outreach than what CB2 requests and that the CB2 SLA
Committee meeting is where these issues are hashed out despite no direct notice to the applicant’s
immediate neighbors and those who would be immediately impacted; and
ix. Whereas, the head of the Broadway Residents Coalition spoke against the application, stating her
involvement when the hotel was first built and that the use of the courtyard was explicitly for guests to
walk through and not for gathering, that the Certificate of Occupancy does not allow for eating and
drinking or for retail, additionally highlighting that the courtyard acts as a conduit for sound and the
music travels up to all the residential windows above the hotel as well as further into the community,
it was also pointed out that there is a nice restaurant across the corner with a wine license serving
breakfast, lunch and dinner in addition to the many other eating and drinking establishment in the
immediate vicinity; the resident living directly above, who submitted materials for the prior application
in 2015 illustrating parties and pig roasts that were occurring illegally in the courtyard, was out of town
and to our knowledge was unaware of the application as was, we believe, the resident above her; and
x. Whereas, the certificate of occupancy does not permit eating and drinking on any floor of the subject
premises, this being an application for a food and beverage operation to service the boutique hotel
guests and the general public, the hotel building being small, historic and being limited to transient
hotel uses and an art studio but not designed for accessory eating and drinking to a hotel , the outdoor
courtyard space being surrounded by residential apartments which will increase the levels of noise and
41disruption to others where no such commercial uses or occupancy previously existed prior to the hotel
opening in 2014 and that there was no outreach to the local block associations or the surrounding
neighbors being most impacted by the issuance of this license concerning the hours and mitigation of
any quality of life concerns; and
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that CB2, Man. recommends denial of the Tavern Wine License for
Broome Hotel Owner LLC 431 Broome St 10013; and
THEREFORE BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that should this application be considered by the
NYSLA, CB2, Man. respectfully requests that this item be calendared to appear before the Full Board of
the NYSLA before any license, temporary or otherwise is issued to this Applicant.
THEREFORE, BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that if despite CB2, Man.’s objections to this
Application, should the NYSLA not find good cause to deny this Application, CB2 Man. recommends in
the alternative that the following stipulations be imposed on any future Tavern Wine license for Broome
Hotel Owner LLC 431 Broome St 10013:
1. Provide a valid Certificate of Occupancy or Letter of No Objection showing that Eating and
Drinking use as an accessory to the Hotel is permitted in advance of the issuance of any license in
order to demonstrate an ability to conform with SLA Rule 48.3 (Section 48.3 - Conformance with
local and other regulations. The Authority expects all on-premises licensees, regardless of type of
premises, to conform with all applicable building codes, fire, health, safety and governmental
regulations.)

zoned, mixed-use building (c. 1922, redeveloped 2022) on Elizabeth Street between Spring and Prince
Streets (Block #492/Lot #8), the street being a small street in Nolita across from the Elizabeth Street
Garden, this building falling within the Special Little Italy District; and
ii. Whereas, the ground floor premises is roughly 3,700 sq. ft. with 2,000 sq. ft. on the ground floor
connected by interior stairways to a 1,700 sq. ft. cellar, the only patron use of the cellar is for bathroom

undetermined maximum occupancy, there is one (1) entry which will serve as patron ingress and egress
and five (5) bathrooms; the store front infill being fixed with no operable doors or windows that open

Elizabeth Street this portion of the building being brand new and includes the general area which was
previously licensed in the previous building under Public Rest L.P. Avroko Rest Grp, LLC G.P. & 27
LTD dba Public (SN# 1143335) from approximately 2003–2017 of which the Applicant was a
principal, the recent renovation completely changing the layout of the premises across the two
buildings and now including an exterior courtyard and complete reconfiguration of the space, and floor
levels; and
vi. Whereas, the Applicant had appeared before CB2, Manhattan’s SLA Committee in October/2023 and
requested at that time to lay the application over to do further outreach to nearby Block Associations
and residents, there being significant opposition, this resulted in a reduction in hours from 2 AM to
1 AM, further reduced at our meeting to midnight and 1 AM and a reduction in outdoor seating, all
else being the same with community opposition not diminished; and
vii. Whereas, members of the Elizabeth Street Block Association, Bowery Block Association, and the
Bowery Alliance of Neighbors the along with other local residents again came to speak against the
application, though appreciating the reduction in hours wished them to be reduced further to 11 PM
weekdays, 12 PM weekends, one of the other existing restaurant on the street having those hours, the
other existing restaurant closing at 12 AM and the most recently heard application to occupy another
portion of the newly created space next door to the instant application having hours of 11 PM and
12 AM; residents stating that this is a highly residential neighborhood whose quality of life is being
severely impacted by a number of factors mostly related to over-saturation: Elizabeth Street between
Prince and Spring Streets is part of the Open Streets program and is closed 4:30 PM to 11 PM
Mondays–Fridays and 11 AM to 11 PM Saturdays and Sundays meaning anyone taking for-hire
vehicles will need to be dropped off at Spring or Prince Streets (Spring street having also participated
in the open Streets program and being closed at similar hours) which are already congested and cannot
handle the burden of the number of for-hire vehicles dropping off/picking up patrons to a 104 seat
destination restaurant; there is already one wood-fired pizza place, though not the same esthetic, around
the corner on Prince Street (Prince Street Pizza) creating noise and trash issues and another around the
corner on Spring Street (Lombardi’s) wood-fired pizza hardly being unique to the immediate area; and
viii. Whereas, the Applicant is applying for another liquor license in the adjacent space in the same
redevelopment at 202 Elizabeth Street with approximately 45 seats and CB2, Man. recently
recommended approval for an On-Premises Restaurant license in the same redevelopment next door at
206–210 Elizabeth Street for a 260 seat restaurant, all together adding 410 new dining seats within one
block, directly next to each other completely oversaturating the immediate residential area
characterized by small local storefronts; the size of majority of these restaurants being larger than the
typical 50 seat restaurants usually found in the area, further leading to over-saturation and significant
impacts on quality of life; the principal also operates two other similar establishments in our
Community Board district which are locally and internationally well-known for being promoted as one
of the 50 best bars in the world, both locations for which members of the local community have had
43direct issues with due to noise emanating from the establishments, not following rules and regulations,
overcrowding on the sidewalks and lack of desire to correct those deficiencies; and
ix. Whereas, this application being subject to the 500 Foot Rule requiring the Applicant to demonstrate
that the public interest would be served by the granting of the On-Premises Liquor License at this
location, there being 78 active licenses within 750 ft,; there being an overwhelming number of licensed
premises within Nolita, the same zip code and throughout Community Board 2, the class and character
of this application being comparable to many of the licensed premises in each area; there being no
demonstrated need for further licensed premises to service the local residents, workers or visitors to
CB2 or NYC in this area, the hours being later than any of the other nearby restaurants raising a concern
in the extension of late night noise from eating and drinking establishments up this block, there already
being a significant number of restaurants and late night bars on Spring Street and Elizabeth Street south
of Spring, residents not wanting their residential block to become another rowdy destination location
after 10pm; there being significant concerns regarding the impact on the existing traffic and parking
conditions through addition of a destination retail, especially if the street continues to be a NYC Open
Street with the addition of 3 more eating and drinking establishments next to each other, there being
significant concerns of oversaturation on this heavily residential block due to the large number of seats
of this instant application, together with the Applicant’s concurrent application for an Aperitivo bar
with small plates in the same redevelopment and the other adjacent restaurant in the same
redevelopment recently recommended approval of by CB2, Man., all three applications combined
adding up to 410 new dining seats adjacent to each other on this small street.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that Community Board 2, Manhattan recommends denial of the
application for an On-Premises Liquor License for L. Pride on behalf of an Entity to be Determined 204
Elizabeth St 10012; and
THEREFORE BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that should this application be considered by the
NYSLA, CB2, Manhattan respectfully requests that this item be calendared to appear before the Full
Board of the NYSLA.

vehicles will need to be dropped off at Spring or Prince Streets (Spring street having also participated
in the open Streets program and being closed at similar hours) which are already congested; the
Applicant having two other similar restaurants in CB2, Man. which are destination restaurants for both
locals and tourists, being promoted as one of the 50 best bars in the world, both locations for which
members of the local community have had direct issues with due to noise emanating from the
establishments, not following rules and regulations, overcrowding on the sidewalks and lack of desire
to correct those deficiencies; and
viii. Whereas, the instant application is being considered in conjunction with another application from this
Applicant heard by CB2, Man. this same month under the same name in the adjacent storefront at 204
Elizabeth St, this instant application operating as an Aperitivo bar with a lighter food menu and
intended to supplement patrons waiting for seating at the Applicant’s adjacent storefront or serving as
a spot for after-dinner drinks in addition to general walk ins; and,
ix. Whereas, concerns were raised about the extension of hours until 1 AM on the weekends when none
of the other restaurants on the block had those hours especially with the Applicant applying for another
liquor license in the adjacent space at 204 Elizabeth Street in the same redevelopment site for an Italian
restaurant with wood-fired pizzas having 104 seats with an undetermined maximum occupancy and
the same hours; additional concerns were raised about oversaturation on this block, especially because
45CB2, Man. recently recommended approval for another On-Premises Restaurant license two doors
north in the same building redevelopment site at 206–210 Elizabeth Street for a 260 seat restaurant,
that, combined with this instant application and the Applicant’s additional application this month
would add 410 new dining seats within one block, directly next to each other in this new redevelopment
completely oversaturating the immediate area; the size of the majority of these restaurants being
significantly larger than the typical 50 seat restaurants usually found in the area, further leading to
over-saturation; and
x. Whereas, this application being subject to the 500 Foot Rule requiring the Applicant to demonstrate
that the public interest would be served by the granting of the On-Premises Liquor License at this
location, there being 78 active licenses within 750 ft,; there being an overwhelming number of licensed
premises within Nolita, the same zip code and throughout Community Board 2, the class and character
of this application being comparable to many of the licensed premises in each area; there being no
demonstrated need for further licensed premises to service the local residents, workers or visitors to
CB2 or NYC in this area, the hours being later than any of the other nearby restaurants raising a concern
in the extension of late night noise from eating and drinking establishments up this block, there already
being a significant number of restaurants and late night bars on Spring Street and Elizabeth Street south
of Spring, residents not wanting their residential block to become another rowdy destination location
after 10pm; there being significant concerns regarding the impact on the existing traffic and parking
conditions through addition of a destination retail, especially if the street continues to be a NYC Open
Street with the addition of 3 more eating and drinking establishments next to each other, there being
significant concerns of oversaturation on this heavily residential block due to the large number of seats
of this instant application, together with the Applicant’s concurrent application in the adjacent
restaurant in the same redevelopment and the other adjacent restaurant in the same redevelopment
recently recommended approval of by CB2, Man., all three applications combined adding up to 410
new dining seats adjacent to each other on this small street; and
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that Community Board 2, Manhattan recommends denial of the
application for an On-Premises Liquor License for L. Pride on behalf of an Entity to be Determined 202
Elizabeth St 10012; and
THEREFORE BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that should this application be considered by the
NYSLA, CB2, Manhattan respectfully requests that this item be calendared to appear before the Full Board

in the ground floor of a three (3)-story, C1-6A-zoned, mixed-use building (c. 1842) on the southeast

and
v. Whereas, the storefront premises was previously operated with an On-Premises Liquor License for 35
years from 1983 to 2018 as Tortilla Flats Inc (SN# 1025686), a West Village Institution and
neighborhood restaurant, and has remained vacant since that restaurant’s closing in 2018; and
vi. Whereas, this application was originally presented to CB2, Manhattan in October/2023 by the
Attorney and a representative from the Jean Georges Vongerichten management company, the actual
Applicant and sole Principal being unavailable; the Applicant being the COO of Chrome Hearts, a
luxury brand which has a 16,000 sq. ft. retail store on the southern end of the same block on Washington
Street at Bethune St. that opened in 2017, where apparently all their new products debut; in addition,
members of Chrome Hearts own the premises of the instant application in addition to the adjacent
60building on West 12th Street which runs full block through to Bethune Street abutting the eastern side
of both the location which is the subject of this application and the Chrome Hearts store; and
vii. Whereas, at the October/2023 meeting, the Attorney presented closing hours of 1 AM and 2 AM on
weekends, the 30-day notice indicating outdoor rooftop use with the Attorney explaining that was an
error, nearby residents and a representative of the Jane Street Block Association appeared in opposition
with concerns about the application, there having been no outreach to neighbors or the local block
association despite ownership of the retail store on the same block for over 6 years and living in the
neighborhood, those concerns had to do with the relationship between Chrome Hearts and the proposed
restaurant, residents stating that though the store always seems empty there are frequently for-hire and
chauffeured vehicles parked and double-parked outside which continuously block the bike lane,
concerns being that the restaurant will attract a similar crowd that travels in for-hire and chauffeured
vehicles leading to congestion on 12th Street, that the closing hours were too late for a restaurant and
later than other Jean Georges restaurant including those in the immediate area, as Jean Georges
Vongerichten’s management company was not listed as one of the principals only operating through a
management agreement, additional concerns were raised that while the public interest was presented
as having a new Jean Georges restaurant (there is another Jean Georges restaurant a few blocks away
at 176 Perry St) the actual operators of the restaurant could change at any time, even prior to the space
opening; additional concerns were raised that the Applicant himself was not present to hear or address
any of the concerns being raised; and
viii. Whereas, the Attorney and Jean Georges representative agreeing in October/2023 to lay the
application over to do further outreach to the community, having done so they returned this month
meeting in November/2023 with the Applicant/Principal as well, they reluctantly reduced the requested
interior hours to midnight and 1 AM weekends when it was pointed out that all other Jean Georges
restaurant close earlier, the Applicant also requesting 11 PM and midnight on weekends for the exterior
seating, they would not be having DJs, live music; nearby residents and a representative of the Jane
Street Block Association once again appeared stating that the hours were still too late on the interior
and exterior, they still did not have clarity about the relationship between the Chrome Hearts store and
the restaurant, that there were press reports of Jean Georges catering events at the Chrome Hearst retail
store already occurring, which some guests refer to as the “Chrome Hearts clubhouse” and concerns
that those type of events with many celebrities and associated impacts will also occur at the proposed
restaurant, that no theme had yet been established for the restaurant, meaning the type or style of food
being served, only that it was a collaboration between Chrome Heats and Jean Georges; the immediate
area being surrounded by residences, concerns that the Applicant, who resides in LA, does not
appreciate the quiet character and nature of the residential neighborhood and the impact of both for-
hire and chauffeured vehicles waiting on West 12th Street, and patrons leaving at the early morning
hours will have on the residents there, and
ix. Whereas, additionally the Applicant stated they were doing a complete historical renovation of the
ground level façade on West 12th Street to return the location to its original features as shown in 1930’s
historical photos as part of the public benefit, the renovation would open a bricked up doorway located
near the corner, in subsequent questioning it became apparent that they were not in fact doing a
complete historical renovation of the West 12th St façade as there were other doorways and windows
at ground level that completed the rhythm of the historical nature of the upper floors that were not
being reinstated, this is simply opening and using a single doorway on West 12th Street which would
shift a patron emphasis to the more residential street; and
x. Whereas, upon further discussion the Applicant agreed to closing hours of midnight 7 days a week
which are typical of area restaurants, closing of the outside seating at 10 PM and 11 PM on Fridays
61and Saturdays and that music would be background only, inclusive of any private parties or events;
and
xi. Whereas, the Applicant has executed and has had notarized a Stipulations Agreement with Community
Board 2, Manhattan which will be incorporated into the “Method of Operation” of the On-Premises
Restaurant License, with those stipulations as follows:
1. The Applicant will operate a full-service Jean Georges Vongerichten restaurant with full menu
items available until closing every night.

ii. Whereas, the Applicant seeks to operate on the sixth-floor interior (3500 sq.ft.) and rooftop (2,850

directly facing, within a relatively short distance, the bedrooms and living quarters of residential
apartments located on the top floors of a large condominium building known as the Printing House at
421 Hudson Street, the Condominium Board having appeared after receiving notice of the Applicant’s
plans on the rooftop, having retained a lawyer due to significant opposition from residents living
therein, the Condominium’s Board representing the majority of owners ultimately negotiating a
stipulation agreement, in compromise over a span of two months, to limit the operations of the private
members club in a satisfactory manner so that it could open and co-exist despite the closeness of the
private members rooftop operations; and
64iv. Whereas, the new membership only club will operate on the sixth floor with 31 tables and 78 patron
seats, including lounge seating, one stand up bar with 4 seats and an Omakase food counter with an
additional 12 seats, for a total interior seating capacity of 78, with a full service kitchen and stairs
leading to the rooftop space, where there will be no rooftop stand up bar, no music of any kind, played
or orchestrated, where all patrons will be seated, and where patron occupancy on the rooftop will never
exceed 65 persons, the rooftop being divided into two spaces, the first (1,966 sq. ft.) covered with glass
and the second (883 sq. ft.) covered by an awning; and
v. Whereas, the glass covered portion of the rooftop will be covered by sliding panels, supporting
materials and vertical Vinyl Barrier blankets that meet or exceed the Sound Transmission Class of 33,
or its equivalent, with any and all openings in the structures facing north and east, including all portions
facing the Printing House Condominium, or materials that meet or exceed the recommendations of the
acoustic survey performed by experts for the Sedona Club, with such sliding panels having no gap with
other structures, sealed shut when closed, and offering no space for sound or light to escape; the glass,
sliding panels, and other structures remaining sealed and closed at all times; and
vi. Whereas, the awning covered rooftop space will be covered to the sky exposure plane by a retractable
awning with a Sound Transmission Class of 26 (STC 26) or better, and like the glass covered portion
of the rooftop, there shall be no gap or space between the awning and the Rooftop Protective Barrier
(as described below) and the retractable awning will not be retracted or otherwise opened during hours
of operations; and
vii. Whereas, there will be a Rooftop Protective Barrier installed along the 20-foot portion of the Sedona
Club rooftop's east parapet facing the Printing House Condominium where there is no structure,
including but not limited to the portion immediately adjacent to the Awning Covered Rooftop, where
the “Safety Barrier” will be present; this Safety Barrier will be a trellis with an embedded transparent
vertical Mass Loaded Vinyl barrier blanket with a Sound Transmission Class of 26 (STC 26) or a
transparent fence that incorporates a material with similar or better acoustic mitigation properties. The
Safety Barrier shall extend at least to the height of the awning, or as high as permissible; and
viii. Whereas, there will be no heating or cooling equipment used at or on any part of the rooftop, including
but not limited to air conditioners, heaters, open or closed flame heaters, no smoking or drug use, there
will be background music to the interior only, with all doors and windows leading to the interior from
the rooftop spaces being closed at all times except for patron/waitstaff egress, and all windows and
doors to the exterior on the sixth floor being closed at all times; and,
ix. Whereas, the Applicant entered into a stipulation agreement with Community Board 2 as follows:

x. Whereas, despite the stipulation agreement brokered between the Printing House Condominium and
the Applicant, condominium owners still appeared in opposition to this liquor license voicing
legitimate questions and concerns regarding the completeness and soundness of the Applicant’s
agreement to soundproof the rooftop, and establish a privacy screen on the east side of the building
facing those apartment directly exposed by their operations, and whether those actions could be
accomplished in a proper and sufficient manner, with this application being subject to the 500 foot
rule; and
xi. Whereas, still additional questions were raised as to whether the private members club satisfies and
meets the statutory elements of a Club License, in conjunction with other NYS regulations governing
not-for-profit entities or organizations, where such licensees may only be issued to an organization
66operated solely for recreational, social, patriotic, political, benevolent or athletic purposes, and which
may not be issued where the intent is to traffic in alcoholic beverages for profit or for pecuniary gain;
and
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that Community Board 2, Manhattan requests the Licensing Division
of the NYSLA review and determine whether the membership club operated by the Applicant properly
qualifies for the class of liquor license being sought; and
THEREFORE BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that if the Applicant does qualify for such license,
Community Board 2, Manhattan recommends denial of the application for a new Club liquor license to
Sedona Club Inc. d/b/a to be determined, 39 Clarkson St., 6th Floor and Rooftop 10014 unless the
statements the Applicant has presented are accurate and complete and that the above-stated conditions and

Vote: Passed, 33 Board Members in favor, 4 abstentions (A. Brenna, R. Kessler, Z. Roberts, R. Sanz).
27. Parcelle 522 Hudson LLC d/b/a Parcelle, 522 Hudson St. 10014 (New Tavern Wine) (Previously
Unlicensed)
i. Whereas, the Applicants and their Attorney appeared before Community Board 2, Manhattan’s SLA
Committee to present an application to the NYS Liquor Authority for new Tavern Wine Liquor License
to operate a Wine Bar in a corner, ground floor storefront located within a four-story, residential
apartment building (circa 1949) at the corner of Hudson and Perry Streets; with this building falling
within NYC LPC’s designated Greenwich Village Historic District; and,
ii. Whereas, the storefront proposed to be licensed was previously operated since 2017 as a fitness studio,
and before that for decades as a dry cleaner, the corner storefront having never previously operated for
eating and drinking or licensed for the service of alcohol, the interior ground floor premises is roughly
900 sq. ft., with a set of stairs leading to 600 sq. ft. basement (basement for storage purposes only),
there is no full-service kitchen, the service of alcohol being the primary method of operation with a
complementary small dish, cold food offering, the Applicant seeking to operate on the adjoining public
sidewalks on Hudson and Perry Streets as well as the roadbed running along Perry Street, for a total of
25 tables and 64 exterior patrons seats, the exterior seating exceeding the number of patron seats for
the interior, where there will be an additional 12 tables and 43 seats, with only 1 bathroom to serve all
patrons and staff, the store front infill being fixed without operable doors or windows that open out to
the sidewalk even though a new doorway entrance is planned to be installed on Perry Street, in addition
to the existing entrance on Hudson Street; and,
iii. Whereas, the Applicant’s hours of operation will be Sundays to Saturdays from 5PM to 12AM, music
will be quiet recorded background only; there will be no DJ’s, no promoted events, no live music or
scheduled performances, no cover fees, and no televisions; and,
iv. Whereas, the addition of 64 exterior seats on the public sidewalks, and roadbed on Perry Street, is
excessive and inappropriate for this residential neighborhood, especially on Perry Street, where no
such exterior seating for the service of alcohol has ever previously existed, and where residents live
immediately above and adjacent to the proposed exterior seating, with Perry Street being a very narrow
roadway, the sidewalk not being of appropriate depth to accommodate the numbers of seats proposed,
and the service aisle, while also allowing for the proper passage of pedestrians; and,
67v. Whereas, there was substantial opposition to this Application from residents living on Perry Street and
on Hudson Street, as well as the local block association, the objections raised primarily focused on the
substantial number of exterior seating for one location, as well as the use of roadbed seating on such a
narrow roadway, with the numbers of exterior seating on Hudson Street being overwhelming, the
immediate area already being inundated with licensed premises next door and within the same building,
with all four storefronts on Hudson Street within this same building being for the service of alcohol,
the Applicants when confronted with these objections not being willing to compromise sufficiently as
to the numbers of exterior seats on the sidewalk or forgo seating in the narrow roadway; and,
vi. Whereas, no one appeared in favor of the application from the Community; and,
vii. Whereas, legitimate questions having been raised about the significant impacts caused by the
excessive number of patrons being served alcohol to the above-referenced exterior areas surrounded
by residences, where no such service has ever existed previously, with this part of Hudson Street
already being overwhelmed by the service of alcohol to the sidewalks and roadbeds running along this
roadway, and the method of operation for this particular application as a wine bar being one focused
on the service of alcohol, there being so many other wine bars already sited within this area, and
throughout Greenwich Village; and
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that CB2, Man. recommends denial of the Restaurant Wine License
application for Parcelle 522 Hudson LLC d/b/a Parcelle, 522 Hudson St. 10014; and
THEREFORE BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that should this application be considered by the
NYSLA, CB2, Man. respectfully requests that this item be Calendared to appear before the Full Board of
the SLA before any license, temporary or otherwise is issued to this Applicant.
Vote: Passed, 33 Board Members in favor, 4 abstentions (A. Brenna, R. Kessler, Z. Roberts, R. Sanz).

Vote: Passed, 33 Board Members in favor, 4 abstentions (A. Brenna, R. Kessler, Z. Roberts, R. Sanz).
TRAFFIC AND TRANSPORTATION
1. Resolution in support of NY State Senate Bill S.7587, requiring registration and licensure of e-
bikes used for commercial purposes and holding delivery platforms responsible for any violations,
with further recommendations.
Whereas in recent years e-bike use has proliferated, especially by commercial delivery workers hired as
independent contractors by third-party delivery platforms (App-based food ordering/delivery systems, e.g.
DoorDash; Uber Eats); and
Whereas the third-party delivery platforms have strict requirements for how many deliveries these
workers should accomplish in a certain amount of time and favor those who can make large numbers of
deliveries in a short time and who are willing to travel further distances, e.g. 10 miles or more; and
Whereas these requirements pressure the delivery workers to travel at high speeds to make faster and
increased pickups and deliveries, disregarding traffic safety rules and taking hazardous riding risks that
endanger and frequently harm all those using the street, particularly pedestrians, as well as themselves,
other e- and non e-bike riders and other vehicles; and
77Whereas constituents increasingly report unsafe conditions caused by the delivery e-bike workers riding
on sidewalks, going the wrong way on the street and running red lights, with pedestrians being in a
constant state of anxiety and fear of being hit as more collisions between pedestrians and these e-bikes
have taken place; and
Whereas NY State Senate Bill S.7587 addresses both the need to easily identify delivery e-bikes that
create and are involved in situations that endanger pedestrians and compromise street safety by ignoring
traffic rules and the need to assign accountability to those ultimately responsible for incentivizing the
delivery e-bike workers to drive unsafely, i.e., the third-party delivery platforms, by:
• Requiring e-bikes used for commercial purposes to be registered with and issued a license (plate)
by the appropriate NY State government agency. Registration would be by and in the name of the
individual driver (owner of the e-bike), i.e., the delivery worker.
• Stipulating that the third-party delivery platforms (as well as business/restaurant owners) pay the
fines for violations that a delivery worker incurs while working for them, whether the rider is an
employee or independent contractor.; and
Whereas in reaching out to the delivery e-bike workers, it was found that although they understand that
the third-party delivery platforms can't pass on costs to them, they worry about unintended consequences.
For example, if they aren't able to deliver as much in a certain amount of time as before, their income
could be reduced or even their jobs. Their expenses could increase with licensing fees and necessary
upgrades to their equipment, for which they are totally financially responsible both for purchase and
upkeep. Amendments are needed to address such concerns, and it has been indicated that work is
progressing in this area; and
Whereas camera enforcement is increasing in use and proving to be effective in capturing hazardous
traffic violations, and highly visible license plates displaying needed identification can facilitate camera
capture (and enforcement) of delivery e-bike violations; and
Whereas a substantial number of delivery workers, notably recent immigrants, rely on the e-delivery
economy as their main livelihood to sustain themselves and their families, frequently facing challenges
due to inadequate legal documentation for employment that potentially dissuades them from registering or
licensing their e-bikes, resulting in their preference for riding under someone else's registration; and steps
need to be taken to safeguard their interests; and
Whereas considering the variance in cost between an eBike and a motor vehicle, a proportional reduction
in fees for e-bikes registration and licensing would be appropriate, e.g. through a sliding scale structure;
and
Whereas delivery e-bike workers are not always familiar with traffic regulations or have language
barriers, requiring accessible education to acquaint them with the rules of the road;
Therefore be it resolved that Community Board No. 2 Manhattan (CB2) supports NY State Senate Bill
S.7587 as a first step to establishing street safety and effective regulation for new mobility modes, in this
case to protect pedestrians and other street users from the danger posed by errant e-bike delivery riders;
and
Be it further resolved that CB2 recognizes that further work is being done to fine tune the bill to increase
its effectiveness and encourages development of procedures to safeguard e-bike delivery jobs and render
costs that are affordable in complying with the new safety measures, such as promoting affordable
registration fees that are in line with the cost of the average e-bike; and
78Be it further resolved that CB2 strongly supports having a requirement incorporated along with those for
registration and licensing for e-bike delivery workers to attend classes on the rules of the road and to
provide for these classes not only in English but in other languages predominantly used by the e-bike
delivery workers; and
Be it finally resolved that CB2 urges that quick attention be given to completing whatever amendments
are considered necessary for strengthening this bill and to moving it to be heard as soon as possible and
quickly passed into law.
Vote: Passed, with 28 Board members in favor, 7 against (C. Dignes, J. Horky, R. Kessler, M. Metzger,
Z. Roberts, R. Sanz, E. Smith), 2 abstentions (C. Booth, V. De La Rosa).
2. Resolution in support of NY State Senate Bill S.6760 requiring minimum insurance thresholds
for third party food delivery services.
Whereas as the incidence of delivery e-bike workers hired as independent contractors by third party
delivery platforms (App-based food ordering/delivery systems, e.g. DoorDash; Uber Eats) continues to
increase, more and more collisions have been occurring between these delivery workers on their e-bikes
and pedestrians or other road users, leading to pedestrian and other road user injuries, often severe, and
even to fatalities; and
Whereas these pedestrian (and other road user)/e-bike delivery worker conflicts are very often the result
of reckless driving on e-bikes (and sometimes e-scooters) by the delivery workers rushing to make as
many deliveries as possible as quickly as possible to fulfill the demands of the third-party delivery
services who have contracted with them and are looking to fulfill as many orders as they can to build
business and profits; and
Whereas because the delivery e-bike workers, being independent contractors, are not covered by the third
party delivery services for liability insurance during their work for them, there is no protection to cover
compensation for the injuries of a pedestrian or other road user struck by the delivery e-bike and its rider
or for their costs of medical care; and
Whereas NY State Senate Bill S.6760 requires third-party food delivery services to provide liability
insurance to delivery e-bike workers while they are working for these services, i.e., while logged into the
delivery platform, whether or not delivering food; and
Whereas e-bike delivery workers could also fulfill the requirement for being insured for liability by
purchasing their own liability insurance, but most of these workers cannot afford to do this, and ultimately
the third-party delivery service would be liable and responsible for the coverage; and
Whereas the compensation made available by the liability insurance required by NY State Senate Bill
S.6760 would provide care for those delivery e-bike collision victims for their injuries, pain and suffering;
and
Whereas the provisions of NY State Senate Bill S.6760 follow those required by NY State law for
coverage by transportation network companies of For Hire Vehicles, which do not allow for the
transportation network companies to pass on their cost; and
79Whereas S.6760 will ensure that third-party delivery services take responsibility for and are directly
invested in the safe conduct of their e-bike delivery people, thereby advancing safety on the street;
Therefore be it resolved that Community Board No. 2 Manhattan (CB2) supports NY State Senate Bill
S.6760 and urges that it be reviewed as quickly as possible and swiftly passed to become law.
Vote: Passed, with 31 Board members in favor, 5 against (C. Dignes, J. Horky, R. Kessler, M. Metzger,
R. Sanz), 1 abstention (C. Booth).
3. Resolution in support of NY State Senate Bill S. 561 increasing the penalties for hit-and-runs
perpetrated by users of e-bikes and scooters.
Whereas it has become increasingly common for e-scooter and e-bike drivers to hit and seriously injure
pedestrians and then flee the scene without reporting; and
Whereas there are strict penalties for automobile drivers who leave the scene of a hit-and-run, yet drivers
of e-bikes and e-scooters, which are motorized and can cause severe injuries hitting and knocking down
pedestrians (and even death, as was the case recently when an e-bike driver hit a woman in Chinatown
and left the scene), yet penalties for their hit-and-run infractions are next to nothing; and
Whereas NY State Senate Bill S. 561 increases the penalties for users of e-bikes and e-scooters who
leave the scene of hit-and-runs where they've struck pedestrians without reporting, so that the e-bike and
e-scooter penalties match those for leaving the scene of automobile crashes; and
Whereas current penalties for leaving the scene of an automobile crash are based on the seriousness of
the injury inflicted on the victim, an injury that would have the same basis if caused by an e-bike or e-
scooter, thus the e-bike and e-scooter drivers should be held to the same standard of responsibility and
accountability as the automobile driver; and
Whereas applying significant penalties to the drivers of e-bikes and e-scooters for leaving the scenes of
their hit-and-runs, matching those for leaving a car crash, can act as a deterrent to leaving this (what is in
essence) scene of the crime;
Therefore be it resolved that Community Board No. 2 Manhattan (CB2) supports NY State Senate Bill
S.561 and urges that it speedily be calendared for hearings and a vote to approve it as a law.
Vote: Passed, with 33 Board members in favor, 3 against (C. Dignes, R. Kessler, E. Smith), 1 abstention
(V. De Le Rosa).
4. Resolution in support of NY State Senate Bill S. 7703 in concept with suggestions for
modifications.
Whereas mopeds (that are legally referred to as limited use motorcycles) have increased in use in NYC,
with a great many of them now being used by delivery workers who formerly used e-bikes, because
mopeds are heavier, can go much faster and travel further distances, allowing the delivery people to fit in
more deliveries in a shorter time than on e-bikes, as desired by the
third-party delivery services with whom they have contracts; and
80Whereas in order to operate in NYC, mopeds (as opposed to e-bikes) are required to be registered and
licensed, but many of them are not registered and don't have a license plate, whether because the moped
buyers are not aware of this requirement or choose to ignore it, in any case, eliminating the means to
identify moped users who are non-compliant with the vehicle and traffic law, who compromise the safety
of all those on the street, and who avoid accountability for harming pedestrians and other street users; and
Whereas The NYC Police Department has been confiscating thousands of unlicensed mopeds, however,
a more far-reaching approach is needed to nail down the numerous other unlicensed mopeds that pervade
the city's streets and threaten people's safety; and
Whereas NY State Senate Bill S.7703 would require that moped registration be done at the point of sale,
i.e., at dealerships (where the majority of mopeds are purchased) where the dealer would be responsible
for both informing the moped buyer of this requirement and registering the moped before it can be
purchased and claimed, compelling registration right on the spot; and
Whereas a great many of these moped dealerships are exceptionally small, often just storefronts that sell
15 or 20 to no more than 40 mopeds a year, and they would be hard pressed to handle the considerable
costs entailed in becoming and acting as agents for registering mopeds, not to mention adding these costs
to typically low-priced mopeds when the aim is to promote sales and encourage prospective buyers to
comply with the law, which only can be accomplished if the cost is reasonable; and
Whereas there are other avenues that are possible for registering a moped without incurring prohibitive
costs while the moped is not released for ownership and use until the registration is accomplished, e.g.,
the buyer could register with the Dept. of Motor Vehicles (DMV) prior to completing purchase and
submit proof of registration to the dealer, or a third party can be used, such as the special services that
bring required documentation to the DMV and obtain the needed license plates, which usually are
available at a reasonable cost;
Therefore be it resolved that Community Board No. 2 Manhattan (CB2) supports the concept put forth
by NY State Senate Bill S.7703 that in order to acquire and operate a moped, proof of registration and a
license is needed at the point of purchase; and
Be if further resolved that CB2 recommends that provisions be developed requiring that the buyer show
proof to the moped dealer that the moped is registered (giving options to accomplish such registration,
e.g., by the buyer registering in person at the DMZ or by using a third party to register) before the dealer
can release a purchased moped to the buyer; and
Be it further resolved that CB2 encourages promoting affordable registration fees that are in line with
the cost of the average moped; and
Be it finally resolved that CB2 looks forward to the further development of requirements in S.7703 for
ensuring that mopeds are registered and licensed and to its becoming law as soon as possible.
Vote: Passed, with 35 Board members in favor, 1 against (E. Smith), 1 abstention (V. De Le Rosa).

AUGUST 2023 EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE REPORTS:
The following resolutions were voted on at the Executive Committee and then voted at the September
Full Board Meeting.
LANDMARKS AND PUBLIC AESTHETICS
1. *1 Bond St. – Application is to replace windows on the alley side of the building and install
additional transom windows.
The applicant did not appear as scheduled for the hearing and therefore there is no recommendation
concerning the application. The applicant must appear for a public hearing before the CB2 Landmarks
Committee prior to the consideration of the application by the Landmarks Commission.
42. *110 Greene St. -The application is to replace infill at the ground floor.
Whereas:
A. The existing condition is a central entrance with glass doors to the retail store flanked by plate glass
windows and more elaborate entrances to the right and left of the central bays; and
B. The proposed windows and the central door are full height glass. Behind the window is a ceiling
suspended box that houses shades, roll down gates and conceals the interior ceiling.
C. Discreet signage is 18” high and in keeping with the building,
D. The north entrance door is not part of this application, and the south entrance is to be converted to a show
window that is essentially replacing the door with plate glass and is easily reversible; and
E. The non-historic sign boxes on either side of the south door are to be removed; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends approval of this application which minimally changes
the existing condition and preserves the architectural integrity of the building.
Vote: Unanimous, with 39 Board Members in favor.
3. *92 Horatio St. – Application is to apply new brownstone stucco facade at the entire ground
floor, install new wood entry doors in the existing opening and replace existing window security
grilles.
Whereas:
A. The corner building is comprised of five buildings, originally with commercial space on the ground
floors, and now a completely residential building with unified façades: and
B. The ground floor current condition is shorn of its detail and the ground floor windows are of random
size and rhythm resulting from the conversion from commercial to residential use, and there is an
undistinguished entrance door; and
C. The ground floor is proposed to be smooth grayish stucco and gives the appearance of a separate base
imitating a stone (with no scoring) other than brownstone, when a brownstone-like finish would both
better serve the applicant’s stated intention of unifying the façades and be more in keeping with the
district and suitable to the building’s color and style; and
D. The proposal organizes numerous larger windows with simple security grills in an agreeable
configuration with modifications on the secondary facade recalling the commercial use of the ground
floor; and
5E. The proposed plain entry door is in mahogany veneer and lacks the detailing that would make it more
in keeping with the building’s existing detailing on the upper floors and neighboring buildings; and
F. Missing headers are to be replaced and are designed after existing headers on the upper floors; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:
A. Approval of the ground floor windows, security grills, and the replacement of the headers; and
B. Denial of the stucco coating unless it is of a brownstone color and tooled in a traditional manner to
suggest actual brownstone in keeping with the style of the building; and
C. Denial of the entry door unless is has detailing suitable to the style of the building.
Vote: Unanimous, with 39 Board Members in favor.
4. *338 W. 12th St. – Application is to reduce the existing 4th floor, construct a new rooftop stair
bulkhead and mechanicals, construct a one-story rear yard extension and to alter the rear façade,
excavate and alter within the horse-walk.
Whereas:
A. Work on the front façade - notably masonry, stoop, windows is considered by Commission Staff; and
B. The stoop was removed in the distant past and was restored in 2004; and
C. The horse walk gate is to be retained and to have a dark wall installed 2’6” behind the gate which the
applicant represents will not be noticeable to the passerby; and
D. The areaway is to be lowered to provide proper entrance below the stairs and causes no harm to the
appearance; and
E. There are alterations to the existing non-visible rooftop addition and bulkhead with change in
volume at the rear, and windows in the front preserve its non-visible condition; and
F. The rear facade brick is considerably degraded, likely from crude removal of a coating, and is to be
restored in the parts that are not replaced by the extension; and
G. The basement and parlor floors have modest wooden extensions somewhat recalling a two-story tea
porch with windows and doors that are within the width of the three original windows and are divided into
three sections, recalling the original punched windows; and
H. The cellar and garden are to be excavated and the garden area rebuilt lower to align with basement
level, and the excavation, as proposed, abuts the adjoining houses on each side of the cellar and rear
6buildings in the adjoining gardens; and
I. The application was deficient in that no detailed designs for the excavation and no engineering studies
were provided concerning the excavation and the critical matter of underpinning of the adjoining houses
and rear garden buildings, and the applicant’s vague representations concerning the excavation and
underpinning details left the impression that they had not yet been seriously considered; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:
A. That the wall in the horse walk door be approved in that it does not disturb the historic view from a
public thoroughfare; and
B. That the areaway modifications be approved; and
C. That the alterations to the non-visible rooftop addition, the restoration of the rear facade upper
floors, the additions on the basement, parlor and second floor be approved; and
D. That the excavation of the cellar and garden be denied until detailed plans and engineering studies are
provided to the Commission which , in their view, ensure that the work does not endanger the integrity of
the subject building, the adjoining buildings, and adjoining gardens and rear garden structures and that the
Commission, in its discretion, return the application to CB2 Community Board for a public hearing if it
deems this appropriate.
Vote: Unanimous, with 39 Board Members in favor.
5. *130 Bank St. – Application is to install new steel deck at first floor level over existing cellar
extension, including new pavers, steel structure, railings and stair access to interior stair hallway,
replace one window with a door to the stair, and add new lighting at exterior façade.
The is no recommendation for this application – The application is incomplete in that the required
mockup has not been built and therefore no recommendation could be made concerning he critical
matter of its visibility from a public thoroughfare. The applicant agreed to request a layover for the
scheduled Commission hearing and to return to the CB2 Landmarks Committee for a public hearing
with the required materials and photographs illustrating the visibility from public thoroughfares.
Vote: Unanimous, with 39 Board Members in favor.
6. *51 Downing St. – Application is to replace the entry doors, garage door, 4th floor windows and
replace existing roof top addition with a new mezzanine addition.
Whereas:
A. The existing non-historic entry doors and garage door and window above (at the original horse
entrance) are to be removed and replaced by plain wooden doors suitable to the stable building with
7transoms at the entry doors and a solid wooden header above the garage door; and
B. There is unobtrusive recessed lighting above the entry doors; and
C. A non-historic gabled rooftop addition which was represented by the applicant as not being
compliant with building codes and the bulkhead are to be removed; and
D. The new rooftop addition is a full width, 22’ high structure in dark grey metal with north and south
curtain walls, partially fitted with dark grey fixed metal louvers; and
E. The proposed new bulkhead is 10’ above the roof, resulting its extending 30’ above the original roof;
and
F. Numerous photographs of the mockup from various points clearly show the rooftop structure is visible,
most notably from Varick Street and Carmine Street where its extremely visible and boldly modern design
aggressively asserts itself, bearing no relationship to either the building or to the historic district; andThis
combination of volume, which makes the addition highly visible, and design, which in no way relates to the
building or the historic neighborhood, are unacceptable in the Greenwich Village Extension II historic
district.
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:
A. Approval of the garage door and the entrance doors together with their lighting; and
B. Absolute denial of the rooftop addition as of a design that does great harm to the historic district and is
unacceptably visible by the standard of “minimal visibility” for rooftop additions that has guided the
Commission with respect to the district.
C. That if the applicant wishes to have consideration of an addition that it be of a design that is in harmony
with the building and the district and is greatly reduced in size and visibility in order that it is in tune with
the district and that the applicant be instructed by the Commission to return to CB2 for a public hearing on
the revised proposal.
Vote: Unanimous, with 39 Board Members in favor.

Whereas, the applicant has not yet chosen a caterer, having asked nextdoor restaurant Da Toscano who has
decided not to participate and will be closed that day, but is hoping to choose a local caterer for the event; and
Whereas, the applicant stated that they had hoped to only apply for a closure for a portion of Minetta Lane
(between 6th Ave and Minetta Street), but QoL members pointed out that due to traffic patterns, this would
require a full closure of both Minetta Lane and Minetta Street, which the applicant was unaware of; and

narrow width of Minetta Lane, and did not see any way that a 15-food fire lane could be maintained during the

is a private event with no public benefit, thrown for the benefit of a large for-profit corporation; now

iv. Whereas, the Applicant originally appeared before CB2, Manhattan in May/2020 for an On-
Premises Liquor License with a similar method of operation but without the use of the adjacent
lot or any other outdoor space; CB2, Manhattan recommending approval of the application with
signed stipulations with one of the stipulations being there will be no use of any outdoor space
for commercial purposes; and
v. Whereas, the Applicant’s Attorney states that they withdrew the On-Premises Liquor License
application with the NYSLA; they have been operating the restaurant with a similar method of
operation since approximately mid-2020, albeit without the service of alcohol; and
vi. Whereas, the instant application includes 24 seats in the adjacent lot to the East at 517 Broome
Street (Block #476 / Lot #26) which was previously an open-air parking garage and is a separate
zoning lot with a separate deed with no certificate of occupancy showing the use being requested
as permitted; the Applicant currently using the lot for seating, with a commercial outdoor
kitchen with charcoal/wood burning grill located in the lot for outdoor cooking without
providing documentation that proper permits have been acquired for an outdoor commercial
kitchen or grilling in the adjacent lot; there being no direct access to the lot from the 519 Broome
Street premises, patrons/servers need to exit the premises and go onto the sidewalk / city
property to enter the adjacent lot by a separate entry on Thompson Street, alternately food and
drink may be dispensed through windows inside 519 Broome Street into what is shown in
supplied diagrams and described by the Applicant as a one-story food prep area, that food prep
area located within the adjacent building lot line which the Applicant’s Attorney described
incorrectly as being within the building lot line of 519 Broome Street, the building lines being
straight and this food prep area and adjacent lot not being part of the Certificate of Occupancy
of 519 Broome Street; it being unclear how a food prep area and adjacent seating can be located
in a separate and distinct building lot but still be included as part of the instant application with
there being no plans filed with DOB to conjoin the two zoning lots and no specific permission
for use of the building for eating and drinking-related uses; and

to be used for outside dining, only for parking cars and that there be no sidewalk café; and
viii. Whereas, the Applicant, after stating that the adjacent lot was simply an extension of the 519
Broome Street premises, proposed removing the outdoor seating from the instant application,
there being significant concerns that the Applicant would not relinquish the use of the adjacent lot
as the Applicant is already operating their restaurant without the service of alcohol in that lot
and its use is part of their method of operation, that lot not being permitted for an eating and
drinking establishment; and
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that CB2, Man. recommends denial of the Restaurant Wine
License for Mishka SoHo Inc dba Mishka SoHo, 519 Broome St 10013; and
THEREFORE BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that should this application be considered by the
NYSLA, CB2, Man. respectfully requests that this item be calendared to appear before the Full Board
of the NYSLA.

and is known for their sandwiches and bakery in addition to their catering business; the instant
application originally being for the service of beer, wine and liquor and while the instant

Applicant has leased a total of 10,000 sq. ft. on the ground floor, going east to Crosby Street;
and
vi. Whereas, there were concerns raised about the precedent of any sidewalk seating on
Broadway, these sidewalks having some of the highest density of sidewalk foot traffic in CB2,

any trash placed out on Broadway due to the congested nature of the sidewalk, the Applicant
stating the trash would be put out on Crosby Street and receptacles brought back in soon after;
and
vii. Whereas, questions were raised by residents and the Committee regarding the need for an On-
Premises Liquor License for sandwich shop with a significant “to-go” business and small on-
premises seating, open weekdays only with 6 PM closing and the eventual overall use of the
10,000 sq. ft. premises, the Applicant stating future plans were to have a large bakery and retail
shop in the Eastern part of the ground floor, fronting Crosby Street, operating independently
from the instant application, there currently being no plans to add a separate catering kitchen
to the premises; it being questionable how a full liquor license serves the public interest
considering the described method of operation including the lack of a catering business
operating out of the premises, the Applicant agreeing to downgrade the application to a
Restaurant Wine license and thus is not subject to the public interest standard of the 500 Foot
Rule; concerns and

LANDMARKS AND PUBLIC AESTHETICS
1. *1 Bond St. – Application is to replace windows on the alley (west) side of the building and install
three transom windows above top floor existing windows.
Whereas:
A. The building is a distinguished, intact individual landmark, worthy of special consideration with
respect to its preservation and any exterior alterations should do no harm to its existing condition; and
B. The 4’ x 3’ windows are proposed to be installed in the west facade above a row of three top-floor
large windows facing an alleyway and are obliquely viewable from a public thoroughfare; and
C. The three windows introduce an unwelcome intervention and asymmetrical fenestration pattern to the
apparently original strictly symmetrical facade configuration; and
D. The applicant made vague references to the possibility that there had been similar windows in the past
and provided neither documentation nor photographs to support this view and there was testimony from
Village Preservation that they had not found such documentation; and
D. The applicant did not present a proposal for the window replacement noted in the application
description; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:
A. Denial of the three windows as an unwelcome intrusion into the intact side facade of an individual
landmark; and
B. Review by the Commission of any proposed window replacement and that the applicant come before
the CB2 Manhattan Landmarks Committee for a public hearing provided that the replacements cannot
properly be approved by the Commission staff.
Vote: Passed, with 37 Board members in favor, and 2 in opposition (C. Dignes, R. Kessler)
2. *77 Bleecker St. – Application is to replace windows on the Broadway and Mercer St. elevations
and establish a Master Plan regarding window replacement.
Whereas:
A. The building’s facade is in pristine condition and appears to retain its original design throughout; and
B. The existing condition is a random assortment of non-historic windows which are represented by the
applicant as being in poor condition and not in compliance with energy efficient regulations; and
47C. Throughout the facade, the replacement is proposed to be outward opening casement windows whose
design is intended to replicate a double-hung historic design and conform to energy efficiency regulations;
and
D. The casement windows have no historical precedent for a building of this design and, when open, will
unacceptably intrude on the overall appearance; and
E. The applicant represented that the cost of replacing the windows with historic double hung windows is
prohibitive, the necessary interior work associated with their installation would unduly disturb the
shareholder occupants, and that double hung windows are not available that meet energy standards; and
F. There was testimony from knowledgeable members of the Committee that double hung windows that
meet energy standards are indeed available and that those of unusual size could be fabricated; and
G. Numbers of NoHo and SoHo buildings of similar design have carried out window replacements with
satisfactory double hung windows; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Manhattan recommends denial of the application for installation of
casement windows and that the replacement be of double hung windows in a historic design appropriate
to the building.
Vote: Passed, with 36 Board members in favor, 2 in opposition (C. Dignes, R. Kessler), and 1 recusal (Z.
Roberts).
3. *130 Bank St. - Application is to install new steel deck at first floor level over existing cellar
extension, including new pavers, steel structure, railings and stair access to interior stair hallway,
replace one window with a door to the stair, and add new lighting at exterior façade.
A. A deck with simple modern metal railing is to be added atop an existing extension; and
B. An existing window in a mid-level stair landing is to be lowered to provide a door to access the deck
and a simple metal spiral staircase is to provide access to the deck; and
C. The railing and stairs design are utilitarian modern and have no relationship to the historic house and
neighborhood; and
D. The stair and a portion of the railing are clearly visible from a public thoroughfare; and
E. The applicant represented that it is not possible to provide access to the deck from the lower floor,
eliminating the need for a stair, when it is clear from the cross-section provided by the applicant that with
minimal alteration to the deck, such access could be provided; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Manhattan recommends denial of the application as an
unwelcome intrusion of non-historic elements to the building, especially in that they are clearly
visible from a public thoroughfare and that there are other possibilities to providing access to the
proposed deck.
Vote: Passed, with 37 Board members in favor, and 2 in opposition (C. Dignes, R. Kessler)
4. *17 Barrow St. Application is to install a metal gate at the stoop entrance.

PARK & WATERFRONT
A Resolution in Support of New Yorkers for Parks’ advocacy push to increase maintenance and
operations funding for parks to 1% of the City Budget.
WHEREAS:
1. Adam Ganser, executive director of New Yorkers for Parks, came to Manhattan Community
Board 2’s Parks & Waterfront Committee meeting on September 6th, 2023 to make a presentation
in support of its 1% for NYC Parks funding initiative.
2. New Yorkers for Parks presented their perspective that there is a need to correct severe neglect
that our parks are suffering and how dedicating 1% of the City Budget could help alleviate this
extensive problem.
3. Parks and open spaces provide numerous benefits to communities, including promoting physical
and mental health; providing spaces for community gatherings and events; improving air quality,
climate resiliency and cooling; and enhancing the overall quality of life for residents.
4. Well-maintained parks mitigate the impact of the urban “heat island” effect and can protect people
from heat waves and reduce summer energy use. They also absorb rainfall, reduce flooding and
recharge drinking water supplies, while saving energy for water management.
5. Many of our City’s parks and open spaces have experienced neglect and underfunding, resulting in
deteriorating conditions and limited programming options.
6. The 1% for Parks campaign proposes that the City dedicate 1% of the City’s annual budget
towards parks and green spaces, ensuring adequate funding for staffing, operations, maintenance,
and other critical needs.
7. Many large U.S. cities allocate more than 1% of their city budgets to parks, which has resulted in
significant improvements in those communities. For example, San Francisco spends 1.6% of its
municipal budget on parks, Los Angeles spends 2.9%, Chicago 4.3% and Minneapolis 5.3%
percent.
8. The 1% for Parks campaign has garnered widespread support from community organizations,
advocacy groups, and residents who recognize the importance of these spaces to the health and
well-being of our community.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that Manhattan Community Board 2:
1. Fully supports the 1% for Parks campaign and urges our elected officials to allocate this increased
funding in the New York City budget.
Believes that investing in parks and open spaces is essential to creating a healthy, vibrant, and
sustainable environment for all residents.
2. Calls on our elected officials to prioritize parks and open space in budget decisions in order to
ensure that each and every community in New York City has access to safe, clean, and well-
maintained parks and open spaces.

6. Little Rest, LLC, dba Raf’s, 290 Elizabeth St. 10012 (OP – Restaurant) (Change in Method of
Operation, Alteration)
i. Whereas, the Applicant and Applicant’s Attorney appeared before Community Board 2, Manhattan’s
SLA Licensing Committee #1 to present an Alteration and Change in Method of Operation to their
existing On-Premises Restaurant Liquor License (SN#134376, exp. 12/31/24) to the existing French
Italian bistro and bakery located in a four (4)-story tenement building with ground floor retail (c. 1878)
on Elizabeth Street between West Houston to the south and Bleecker Street to the north (Block
#521/Lot #64) in Greenwich Village, the building falling within NYC LPC’s designated NoHo East
Historic District; and
ii. Whereas, the Applicant has been in operation at this location since January/2023, the original
application being heard by CB2, Manhattan in December/2021; and
iii. Whereas, the Alteration Application is to increase the number of ground floor tables from 12 to 18,
increasing the number of seats from 41 to 44, decrease the size of the customer bar and reduce the bar
seats from 14 to 8, add a private dining area in the cellar consisting of one (1) table and 20 seats as
well as a service bar, the total seated occupancy increasing from 55 seats to 72 seats and a maximum

use and request closing hours of 2 AM for private/special events; and
iii. Whereas, when the Applicant originally appeared before CB2, Manhattan in December/2021 the board
unanimously recommended denial of the application in large part due to closing hours of midnight and
1 AM as opposed to 11 PM on a small, quiet, primarily residential block and the quality of life impacts
the later hours would have on the adjacent residents, the NYSLA approving the application with the
current hours of 9 AM to 12 AM Sundays through Thursdays and 9 AM to 1 AM Fridays and
Saturdays; and
iv. Whereas, concerns were again raised regarding late hours with the instant Change in Method of
Operation application requesting a 2 AM closing when there are events, resulting in 72 persons leaving
the premises at around the same time, after midnight, the noise of patrons gathered outside as they say
goodnight and the traffic congestion of for-hire vehicles congregating pick up departing patrons, the
Applicant reluctantly agreeing to keep the hours for private/special events the same as those for the
regular operation of the restaurant; and
67v. Whereas, the hours of operation will continue to be from 9 AM to 12 AM Sundays through Thursdays
and 9 AM to 1 AM Fridays and Saturdays with no exceptions for private/special events; music will be

area for commercial purposes; and
vi. Whereas, the Applicant had stated both this month and at their initial meeting with CB2 Manhattan,
in addition to materials presented to the NYSLA, that they would handle the building’s trash pick up
so as not to have residential refuse placed outside their restaurant, residents commenting that they were
unaware of the building’s new trash procedures since the Applicant took over responsibility for the
building’s trash; and
vii. Whereas, the applicant specifically did not inform the most impacted residents living immediately
above their premises both in the front and rear of the building and other residents of the building in
which they are located of the instant application and their plans despite claims of being a good neighbor
and professional operator, instead utilizing the standing request for all applicants in CB2 to reach out
to ALL immediately impacted residents to only reach out to neighbors who support the instant
application thereby undermining the intent of the request for public outreach by CB2; there being
testimony and written submission from those immediately impacted receiving no notice from the
applicant despite having their homes in the same building and outlining outstanding issues, concerns
and objections which have not been resolved; the applicant also presented letters in support from other
immediate residents who they had reached out to directly; and
viii. Whereas, following this month’s CB2, Manhattan SLA1 committee meeting, but prior to CB2’s Full
Board meeting, it was brought to the Committee’s attention that the Applicant held a private event with
security, rope lines and tables and chairs on the sidewalk adjacent to their storefront serving gelato,
with for-hire vehicles blocking the street causing quality of life issues for residents; the Applicant
attesting to no outdoor activity not only in their application to CB2 but in their application to the
NYSLA as well; CB2 Manhattan presenting the Applicant with the standard stipulation used when
there is no outdoor seating applied for with the application stating “Will not operate a backyard garden
or any other outdoor area for commercial purposes including any sidewalk café and/or roadbed
seating,” the Applicant wanting to quantify that they will only stipulate to not using the outdoor for the
service of food and alcohol, the Applicant previously stating to secure their initial liquor license
application on all questionnaires and statements to both CB2, Manhattan and the NYSLA, including
in their 500' statement to the ALJ, that there is no outdoor use and therefore no impact on the local
community; and
ix. Whereas, the Applicant has executed and has had notarized a Stipulations Agreement with Community
Board 2, Man. that they agreed to submit to the NYSLA and agreed would be attached and incorporated
into the method of operation of the On-Premises Restaurant Liquor License, with those stipulations as
follows:

zoned 4-story, residential building (c. 1900) on Thompson Street between West 3rd and Bleecker Streets
(Block #543/Lot #67), the building falls within NYC LPC’s designated South Village Historic District;
and
ii. Whereas, the premises was previously licensed with a Tavern Wine license (SN# 1303099) as part of
a larger space by Irving Farm Coffee Roasters from 2017–2019, with fixed windows and no outdoor
seating, which was preceded by two storefronts comprised of a deli and a laundromat, both of which
served the surrounding local community; and
iii. Whereas, the ground floor storefront is roughly 2,400 sq. ft. (1,200 sq. ft. on the ground floor and
1,200 in the cellar, the floors connected by two interior staircases with no patron use of the cellar);
69there will be 18 tables with 46 seats and one (1) bar with 11 seats for a total patron occupancy of 57

by Irving Farm coffee, to operate three distinct businesses under one license with one business
operating out of the cellar and there being co-mingling of the two ground floor business, in addition to

unanimously recommended denial of the application (November/2021 SLA resolutions); and
vi. Whereas, following CB2, Manhattan’s denial resolution the Applicant chose to move forward with a
Restaurant Wine application in 2022 because they could not afford to wait the lengthy NYSLA
processing time for an On-Premises Liquor License, bypassing a hearing with CB2, Manhattan; the
Applicant receiving a temporary license for Restaurant Wine (SN#131667) but received a deficiency
notice on their NYSLA application which prompted a new 30-day notice for a Restaurant Wine license
to be sent to CB2, Manhattan in July/2023, the Applicant then laying over the application from
August/2023 to September/2023; and
vii. Whereas, the instant application no longer includes the approximately 600 sq. ft. northern corner part
of the premises currently occupied by Irving Farm Coffee, there having been a wall built to separate
the corner space from the southern part of the storefront that is accessed via doors on Thompson Street,
the cellar currently shared by the Applicant and Irving Farm Coffee being one large space and not
delineated by a wall, the cellar storage of alcohol by the Applicant being in a location that may be
accessed by Irving Farm Coffee and therefore not permitted by the NYSLA; and
viii. Whereas, the instant application includes both sidewalk seating consisting of 12 seats and roadbed
seating consisting of 34 seats for a total of 46 exterior seats; the Applicant failed to apply for a permit
for outdoor sidewalk or roadbed seating under the Temporary Open Restaurant program before the

any permanent program because the program has not commenced, but has nevertheless been seating
customers on the sidewalk and serving alcohol to them without having secured permission from the
City of New York for the utilization of Municipal Space for outdoor seating or permission from the
NYSLA for the service of alcohol because there is no permit or permission to use the sidewalk space;
the applicant stated that they believed they were able to use permission granted to another licensed
entity previously located in that location (Irving Farm Coffee) to both use the sidewalk and serve
alcohol, that clearly not being allowed; and
ix. Whereas, the Applicant stating they would not install any roadbed seating at this time and would cease

and
70x. Whereas, the Applicant has executed and has had notarized a Stipulations Agreement with Community

extensive amount of outdoor seating in roadbed structures at the adjacent restaurant extending well
beyond the restaurant frontage in addition to his other restaurants also utilizing roadbed seating beyond
the store frontage, Bedford Street being a narrow residentially only zoned street making it difficult for
emergency vehicles to pass and the additional pedestrian congestion of servers and diners congregating
on the sidewalk entering and leaving roadbed structures on the very narrow sidewalks of Bedford Street
making pedestrian passage all the more difficult; and
vii. Whereas, the Committee raised concerns as to whether the instant application would act independent
of the Applicant’s adjacent restaurant or whether it would serve as essentially a private dining room
for the adjacent restaurant, the diagram illustrating the four (4) dining tables set up as one large table,
the Applicant stating that the new premises would host private parties but that it would act entirely
independent of the adjacent restaurant, with its own menu and chef, purchase and storage of alcohol

2. Par Avion Group LLC dba Nightingale, 37 Carmine St 10014 (New OP–Bar/Tavern) (installing
operable windows) (previously unlicensed)
i. Whereas, the Applicant and the Applicant’s Attorney appeared before Community Board 2,
Manhattan’s SLA Committee to present an application to the NYS Liquor Authority for a new On
Premise License to operate a bar/wine bar in a five-story, tenement-style residential building (c. 1910)
on a residentially zoned block of Carmine Street between Bleecker and Bedford Streets (Block
79#586/Lot #36), this building and area falling within Greenwich Village’s Landmarked Historic District;
and
ii. Whereas, the Applicant seeks to gut renovate the existing ground floor storefront, which was
previously operated for decades as a printing solutions business closing every evening by 8 PM, to
open a “sophisticated and intimate bar and restaurant serving classic French fare paired with French
wines and curated cocktails” despite there being no kitchen planned, while also seeking to install
operable French doors that will open up the entire interior premises to the exterior public sidewalk in
front, with the premise proposed to be licensed having never previously been licensed for the service
of alcohol or for eating/drinking purposes; and
iii. Whereas, the ground floor premise is roughly 830 sq. ft., with an additional 830 sq. ft. in the
cellar/basement, the cellar/basement being for storage purposes; there is no kitchen, a food prep space
is identified behind a large 28' stand up, no Letter of No Objection from the NYC Dept. of Buildings
was presented, there are16 interior tables with 44 patron seats, with the aforementioned stand up bar
with 18 additional seats and one (1) service counter for a total of 59 patron seats in the premises, and
one (1) bathroom; and

Monday through Wednesday, 5 PM to 1 AM Thursdays and Fridays, and 12 PM to 1 AM on Saturdays;
music will be recorded background, no DJ’s, no live music or televisions; and
v. Whereas, the Applicant also seeks to serve alcohol to tables on the public sidewalk in front of the
premises proposed to be licensed, with 6 tables and 12 seats until 10:00 PM every night within a few
feet of ground floor residential apartments, there will be no roadbed seating, the ground floor residential
apartments being a conforming use in this residentially only-zoned area; and
vi. Whereas, there was significant opposition to this application from residents living on Carmine Street,
and the storefront’s immediate neighbors living adjacent to and next door, as well as multiple block
associations (Carmine Street, Bedford Downing Street, Central Village and West Village Residents),
the Church on the same block (Our Lady of Pompeii) also submitting documentation confirming its
church building is exclusively used as a place of worship, with its frontage and doors on Carmine Street
being within 200 feet of the premises proposed to be licensed; and
vii. Whereas, those who appeared in opposition voiced concerns regarding about license saturation on
their residentially only-zoned block and within the immediate area, with Carmine Street having
transformed over the last decade from one that offered dry retail business that predates the residential
zoning to one lined with licensed late night establishments, with no business diversity, exacerbated by
the open restaurant’s program allowing all the existing and future licensed establishments to open out
onto the sidewalk and roadway where they were previously not permitted, the block being currently
zoned for residential use only, many of the licensed storefronts having open facades allowing interior
music to escape out to the public sidewalk, the impacts of noise, trash, rodents and traffic from such
oversaturation taking over the neighborhood, having significant impacts on residents; and
viii. Whereas, still other long-time residents living immediately next door on the ground floor appeared in
opposition, with their building sharing a wall with the proposed bar, voicing concerns overhearing the
activities of a bar just a few feet away from their windows with interior music having a devastating
impact on their lives; and
80ix. Whereas, the Applicant did submit a petition with signatures from residents but the petition did not
properly identify the address and its proposed method of operation, and long-time residents living next
door and in the immediate area appearing in opposition questioned the credibility of the petition, further
indicating no attempt was made to contact them; and
x. Whereas, no one appeared in support of the application; and
xi. Whereas, this application being subject to the 500 Foot Rule requiring the Applicant to demonstrate
that the public interest would be served by the addition of another On-Premises Liquor license at this
location, the storefront premise having never been licensed for the service of alcohol, there being a
significant number of licensed establishments throughout Community Board 2 and the immediate
block, there being 94 active SLA licenses within 750 feet of the location proposed to be licensed, with
7 additional pending licenses, the location to be licensed is located in a residentially zoned community,
has no kitchen, which limits its method of operation to one based on the service of alcohol, the
transformation of this area causing existing residents to absorb many adverse impacts that the addition
of another license will exacerbate; and
xii. Whereas, it also appears the premises proposed to be licensed is within 200 feet from Our Lady of
Pompeii on the same side of Carmine Street, an active place of worship; and
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that Community Board 2, Manhattan recommends denial of the
application for a new On-Premises Liquor License for Par Avion Group LLC dba Nightingale, 37
Carmine St 10014; and
THEREFORE BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that prior to the issuance of an On-Premises Liquor
license at 37 Carmine Street, New York, NY 10014, a measurement should be undertaken from the
closest, active entrance of Our Lady of Pompeii, an existing place of worship, to determine if it is located
within 200 feet of premises proposed to be so licensed; and
THEREFORE BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that should this application be considered by the
NYSLA, CB2, Manhattan respectfully requests that this item be calendared to appear before the Full Board
of the NYSLA; and

3. People’s NYC LLC, 113 West 13th St 10011 (OP–Bar/Tavern)

Manhattan’s SLA Licensing Committee to present an application for an On-Premises Bar/Tavern
license to operate a sophisticated neighborhood cocktail lounge on the below-grade ground
floor/basement of an R6-zoned, three (3)-story residential building (c. 1835, renovated 1985) on 13th
Street between 6th and 7th Avenues (Block #609/Lot #52), the building falling within NYC LPC’s
Greenwich Village Historic District; and
ii. Whereas, the ground floor premises is approximately 2,700 sq. ft. consisting of 1,800 sq. ft. on the
ground floor/basement and 900 sq. ft. in the cellar, the two floors connected by an interior stairway
with no patron use of the cellar; there will be approximately 17 tables and 40 seats and two (2) bars
with 21 seats for a total seated patron occupancy of 61 and maximum occupancy of 74 persons; the
81premises has two (2) doors which will be used for patron ingress and egress and two (2) patron
bathrooms; and
iii. Whereas, the hours of operation will be from 11 AM to 12 AM Sundays through Wednesdays, 11 AM
to 1 AM Thursdays and 11 AM to 2 AM Fridays and Saturdays; music will originate from
iPod/CDs/streaming services or may be curated by a DJ but at all times will be played at background
levels and tied into the existing sound system with the limiter set following the recommendations made
by Acoustilog in their August 22/2023 report and all recommendations for soundproofing made in that
report will be followed; there will be no: dancing, promoted events, scheduled performances or cover
fees, velvet ropes, movable barriers or security personnel; the store front infill being fixed with no
operable doors or windows that open out to the sidewalk aside from the entryway; there is an
approximately 150 sq. ft. exterior area within the property line in the entryway which in the past
included a display case with the menu and press clippings but there is no rear yard, sidewalk café or
roadbed seating or other exterior area for the service of alcohol; and
iv. Whereas, the premises to be licensed was previously operated as a full-service Spanish restaurant
known as Spain (Val Mac Restaurant Inc, SN# 1028375, surrendered) which opened in 1966 and closed
in early 2020 at the start of the pandemic and was once part of a small enclave called “Little Spain”
when the neighborhood streets were lined with Spanish businesses, this mid-block building is in
residential-only zoning and predates the existing zoning, but because of its low impact use as a
neighborhood restaurant, it was consistent with the residential only character of the immediate
community; despite the claims of the applicant that this location is not subject to the 500 Foot Rule, it
should be noted among other facts that this space has been vacant since the previous restaurant closed
in 2020, there is no transfer of assets and there is no active liquor license at this location, the applicant
having not sought a declaratory ruling consistent with SLA Advisory 2022-35 and therefore the
presumption should be that the location is subject to the 500 ft rule; and
v. Whereas, the Applicants originally proposed closing time was 2 AM, 7 days a week, the area being
residentially zoned and surrounded by apartments including the rear area of the restaurant – a
basement-level back room which includes a skylight that is surrounded by residential apartments; the
prior use of the space being a neighborhood restaurant, the instant application being for a bar with DJs,
concerns were raised about the quality of life impacts to nearby residents of patrons arriving and
leaving the bar at later hours, those impacts being significantly different than the prior operation as a
restaurant with earlier hours and no DJs, the Applicant agreeing to close at midnight Sundays through
Wednesdays and to adhere to all the recommendations in the Acoustilog report in regards to
soundproofing and agreeing that Acoustilog would return after soundproofing was done to ensure that
the system was performing to specifications; and
vi. Whereas, this application being subject to the 500 Foot Rule requiring the Applicant to demonstrate
that public interest and public convenience would be served by the granting of a liquor license at this
location, there being a significant number of licensed establishments throughout Community Board 2

TRAFFIC AND TRANSPORTATION
1. Resolution in support of and requesting to co-name the S.W. corner of Mulberry and Grand Sts.
'Vincent ""Vinny Peanuts"" Cirelli Sabatino Corner.'
Whereas numerous friends, neighbors and admirers have requested that the S.W. corner of Mulberry and
Grand Sts. be co-named for 'Vincent ""Vinny Peanuts"" Cirelli Sabatino, a beloved Little Italy activist and
constant presence who died of COVID-19 in 2020; and
Whereas Vincent Cirelli Sabatino lived and worked in Little Italy his entire life, selling peanuts and all
kinds of Italian candies (hence his ""Vinnie Peanuts"" nickname) at the Mulberry/Grand St. corner site
requested, a spot where neighborhood people gathered, socialized and shared information, along with
93many visitors who joined in the camaraderie, all drawn by the friendly community ambiance that ""Vinnie
Peanuts"" instilled; and
Whereas ""Vinnie Peanuts"" was dedicated to his Little Italy community and generous in devoting his time
to fostering improvements and preserving the neighborhood's cultural traditions. Among the many
initiatives he championed and worked for was the establishment of the first new affordable housing in
Little Italy in 75 years at 21 Spring St.; building support to assure the continuation of the San Gennaro
Feast; improving and sustaining the Little Italy Mall; and creation of the Little Italy Special (zoning)
District (He was often seen at Community Board 2 Manhattan (CB2) meetings); and
Whereas ""Vinnie Peanuts"" largesse also extended to raising money for charities, both for the community
and beyond, carrying out campaigns with the Sons of Little Italy and Lt. Joseph Petrosino Lodge to
collect funds for such causes as Autism, Alzheimer's, the Gift of Sight, and Cooley’s Anemia, and helping
the Henry Street Settlement. In his quest to gather support, he went around to businesses and stopped
people on the street, all in the interest of helping neighbors and all those in need; and
Whereas CB2 has received a petition signed by Little Italy residents, many occupying the same block
where ""Vinny Peanuts"" lived and worked, requesting that the S.W. corner of Mulberry St. and Grand St.
be co-named 'Vincent ""Vinny Peanuts"" Cirelli Sabatino Corner' and praising his memory; and
Whereas this requested co-name is completely in keeping with CB2's Street Co-Naming Guidelines
which state that ""The person or entity proposed for the co-naming must have contributed in some
extraordinary way to the welfare of the block and/or the community with a consistent voluntary
commitment and dedication to improving community conditions...."";
Therefore be it resolved that CB2 wholeheartedly supports and requests the co-naming of the S.W.
corner of Mulberry and Grand Sts. 'Vincent ""Vinny Peanuts"" Cirelli Sabatino Corner.'
Vote: Unanimous, with 39 Board members in favor.
2. Resolution requesting a traffic light at Houston and Wooster Sts.
Whereas the SoHo Alliance has presented a request on the behalf of its constituents for installing a traffic
light at Houston and Wooster Sts., an intersection and street crossing that has been dangerous for years
and now is more dangerous than ever; and
Whereas with heavy, fast-moving traffic, Houston St. has traffic lights at every intersection - except
Wooster St. This has led to a treacherous state of affairs at Houston and Wooster where motorists
heading east from West Broadway (which is signalized) speed through, usually oblivious to people trying
to cross at Wooster, indeed not even realizing that there is a pedestrian crossing at that location, and often
fixated on making the green light at the Greene St. intersection and accelerating to get there (the converse
also happens on Houston's north side, with traffic heading west from Greene speeding by Wooster to
West Broadway). Even when the lights are red on Greene and West Broadway, drivers race by, ignoring
waiting pedestrians; and
Whereas the Wooster St. corridor is heavily used by residents, tourists, people working in the area, local
visitors, NYU students and others accessing the many shops, facilities, eateries and sites along the way,
including a large supermarket, many NYU buildings, parks and a playground, underlining the exceptional
importance for a signalized crossing at Wooster and Houston that ensures safe access between the
neighborhoods for all those using Wooster; and
94Whereas it has been observed that the Wooster/Houston St. intersection has always been hazardous, and
the installation of a traffic light is long overdue, but people now report that the danger at that location has
grown considerably in recent years because of the heavy increase in traffic. A large increase also has
been noted of pedestrians in that area, all who are concerned about using that crossing, further
demonstrating the necessity of a traffic light there; and
Whereas it was reported that a large segment of the population living at the location and in the vicinity of
Houston and Wooster has aged in place, exacerbating the difficulty of crossing that intersection for both
seniors and the physically challenged who often walk slowly and have difficulty getting across the street
in the absence of controls that provide for traffic stops and adequate crossing time while also finding it
difficult to walk to another intersection. This difficulty is also experienced by parents with children and
strollers or those with shopping carts and others who cannot move quickly; and
Whereas an unusually large influx of correspondence was received from the surrounding community, all
strongly supporting the traffic light request and expressing their need for a safer crossing; and
Whereas a considerable representation from the community appeared in person and online to voice their
concerns about the hazardous location and emphasize how much the requested traffic light is crucial for
people's safety and accessibility, as well as for the proper management of traffic with pedestrian safety the
priority; and
Whereas in the past, the absence of a traffic light at Houston and Wooster Sts. has led to serious crashes
at that intersection, e.g., some years back as a car made a U-turn from the north side to the south side of
Houston St. at Wooster, a speeding taxi traveling east on the south side there unconstrained by any traffic
control swerved to avoid running into the car, lost control and smashed into the lobby of 61 W. Houston
St. (fortunately in the early morning with the doorman still in back and no one else there). Another past
incident was cited, in which a woman, crossing the same intersection early on a Sunday morning was hit
and killed by a car; and
Whereas there is no crosswalk on Houston St. at Wooster St;
Therefore be it resolved that Community Board No. 2 Manhattan (CB2) urges the NYC Dept. of
Transportation (DOT) to speedily install a traffic light at Houston and Wooster Sts.; and
Be it further resolved that CB2 asks that this traffic light include an accessible pedestrian signal (APS)
to help all those who are visually challenged to cross the street safety; and
Be it finally resolved that CB2 requests that DOT install a crosswalk on Houston St. at Wooster St.

STANDING COMMITTEE REPORTS
ARTS & INSTITUTIONS: METRONOME LETTER
Re: “Metronome/Climate” Art Wall
Dear Mr. Khafif:
On behalf of Community Board 2/Manhattan (CB2), I write to encourage MKF Realty to join with all
interested parties to engage in an open discussion concerning the future of the existing public art
installation known as “Metronome/Climate.”
“Metronome” was originally installed on the north facade of One Union Square South in 1999 and
expresses the investigation into the nature of time as captured by artists Kristen Jones and Andrew
Ginzel. The current iteration of the work, “Metronome/Climate,” continues that investigation with a
focus on the relationship between time and the impending crisis of climate change.
On June 27, 2022, artists Kristin Jones and Andrew Ginzel presented to the Arts & Institutions Committee
of Manhattan Community Board 2 (CB2) regarding their proposal to update and transform their original
work: Metronome /Climate art wall at One Union Square South.
The artists first made CB2 aware of their efforts to move this project forward in 2019, describing
challenges to foster a productive good faith discussion between stakeholders that include the One Union
Square South property owners and the Union Square BID. The artists maintain that, despite best efforts,
they remain unsuccessful in engaging these parties in a dialogue about moving the project forward. As a
result, the artists have been unable to make progress on the project.
CB2 supports the artists’ commitment to this work and their re-imagining a new iteration of their previous
works. CB2 believes that the appropriate next step is the convening of a meeting that includes the artists,
the property owners, and representatives of community organizations and stakeholders with the shared
goal of exploring the artists’ evolving proposal in this signature location.
HUMAN SERVICES
IN SUPPORT OF THE DOOR’S APPLICATION TO BE CLASSIFIED AN ARTICLE 31 LICENSED
MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC BY NEW YORK STATE OFFICE OF MENTAL HEALTH
WHEREAS:
1) The Door is a social service organization founded in 1972 with a mission to “empower young
people to reach their potential by providing comprehensive youth development services in a
diverse and caring environment”; and
32) The Door provides people aged 12-24 with education, legal expertise, meals and pantry, assistance
with housing, employment, and many other services; and
3) The Door provides a broad range of health services as a New York State licensed Article 28
facility and a Federally Qualified Health Center; and
4) The Door provides mental health counseling but is reimbursed for these services only to the extent
permitted under Article 28, and otherwise carries the financial burden through its general budget;
and
5) The organization has experienced an increased demand in mental health services of all kinds, from
psychiatric care to community health, and therefore seeks to expand its mental health program;
6) The Door has applied to be licensed as a behavioral health clinic by the New York State Office of
Mental Health under Article 31; and
7) Such license would permit The Door to receive Medicaid reimbursement for the mental health
services it provides; and
8) The application requires some modifications to The Door’s physical plant.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED THAT COMMUNITY BOARD 2, MANHATTAN
1) Supports The Door’s application to become an Article 31-licensed mental health facility; and
2) Supports capital grants to enable The Door to modify its physical plant so as to comply with
Article 31 requirements; and
3) Recognizes with gratitude the efforts of The Door to improve the lives of young people residing in
New York City, both in and outside Community District 2.
Vote: Unanimous: 42 Board Members in favor.
LANDMARKS AND PUBLIC AESTHETICS
LANDMARKS 1
1. *350 Bleecker St. - The application is to paint the storefront portion of the facade a white
color, to install a bracket sign, and to install signage with a polished gold finish.
(Laid Over)
2. *841 Broadway - The application is to remove and existing glass panel infill and install
an ATM machine and metal surround and to add lighting in an existing canopy.
Whereas:
A. For security concerns, the applicant has closed the 24-hour ATM lobby and wishes to install the
machine accessible from the sidewalk; and
B. The panel replaces an existing pane of glass and additional lighting, and a security camera will be
installed in the existing canopy; and
C. The panel is the bright red signature color of the bank and matches the existing sign above; and
D. The large red expanse of the panel creates stark contrast to the adjacent window and masonry, and if
the expanse of red was reduced by adding a neutral color, the contrast would be softened and be more
harmonious with the building; and
4E. The applicant was receptive to the suggestion that the area of red be reduced; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends approval of the application provided that the
amount of red in the panel be reduced and replaced with a neutral color as the primary color in order to
soften the effect on this historic building.
Vote: Unanimous, 42 Board members in favor.
3. *136-140 Grand St. - The application is to install awning over new residential lobby and
increase elevator roof bulkhead.
Whereas:
A. The existing freight elevator is located in the typical position at the facade and will be converted to a
passenger elevator which necessitates an increase in height of approximately 10’ to the bulkhead to
provide ADA access to the roof; and
B. The increase is quite visible, as are other bulkheads and rooftop additions to similar buildings the
neighborhood, though it is not objectionable, and the grey acrylic stucco complements the color of the
building which serves to diminish the obtrusiveness; and
C. No historic material will be disturbed; and
D. The bay for the existing elevator entrance and the adjacent bays will have wooden doors with glass
panels patterned after the doors on Grand Street that are in keeping with the building and the district; and
E. An contemporary aluminum and glass canopy inspired by historic sheds in the district extends 6’ over
the sidewalk and unobtrusive down-light is adjacent to the interior I beams; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends approval of the sensitive design of a necessary
modification that minimizes the visual impact and respects the historic character of the building.
Vote: Passed, 42 Board members in favor, 1 recusal (E. Yoo).
4. *60 Greene St. - The application is to replace existing ground floor infill, paint ground
floor to match existing, repair and paint existing handrail and entrance steps.
Whereas:
A. The building is distinguished, largely intact, and worthy of individual landmark designation, and it has
an unusually delicate, detailed design especially characterized by a rhythm of repeated infill at the ground
floor
B. The proposal is to replace sections of the ground floor infill including wooden bulkhead at the former
position of a door with a new cast iron panel to match the existing window bulkheads, to paint the railings
to match existing and to replace the original configuration of double pane windows with single pane plate
glass; and
5C. The introduction of a new non-historic, boldly contemporary plate glass window into the original
wooden infill gravely harms the historic character of the building and interrupts the rhythm of the ground
floor infill; and
D. The applicant’s assertion that it is “impossible” for the shop to show its wares (watches) with the
divided windows is spurious; and
E. The applicant represented, without verification, that the wooden infill was deteriorated and that it
would be replaced with reproductions; and
F. There was written testimony with extensive verification submitted to the Board that, apart from a small
portion of one door, the wooden infill is in good condition and, apart from a small portion of one door,
does not need to be replaced; and
G. The store entry door is to be replaced with a reproduction of the existing door to provide greater
security; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2 Manhattan recommends:
A. A forceful denial of replacing the historic divided ground floor windows in three bays with single
panes of plate glass, which destroy the repeated rhythm of the ground floor; and
B. Denial of the replacement of the wooden infill based on a report that the wood is in good condition
except for a small portion of one door which may be repaired; and
C. Approval of the replacement of the wooden window bulkhead with cast iron to match the existing
original in other bays; and
D. Denial of the replacement of the entrance unless it if verified by staff that the existing door is
unsatisfactory and if it is found to be in need of replacement that the door with a faithful reproduction of
the existing door and of the painting of the new doors and railings to match existing.
Vote: Passed, 42 Board members in favor, 1 abstention (A. Zeldin).
5. *473 Broadway - Remove the existing greenhouse structure on the east side of the existing
penthouse, add a roofed enclosure on the west side, alter existing portion of the penthouse,
raise exhaust fan structures with new exhaust fans, and replace existing air conditioner
equipment.
Whereas:
The modifications to the existing penthouse and the addition of an enclosure to the existing exhaust fans
are sensitively designed for minimum visibility and clad with lead coated copper and similar colored
materials further minimizing the intrusion to the rooftop view; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends approval of the application which presents no
objectionable views from a public thoroughfare.
Vote: Unanimous, 42 Board members in favor.
66. *188 Spring St. - The application is to alter the front facade, to demolish the rear wall,
construct a rear extension, and excavate the cellar and a portion of the rear garden.
Whereas:
A. The building, though altered and re-bricked is one of the few surviving buildings of its period in SoHo
and is further distinguished by having the horse walk entrance preserved; and
B. The left door, originally for a horse walk and later repurposed for a commercial use of the ground
floor, is to be replaced with a punched opening without regard for the great historic importance of
retaining the door as a memory of the original horse walk; and the plate glass commercial window is
proposed to be lengthened and fitted with a wooden casement; and
C. This window configuration was represented by the applicant as a “homage” to the later commercial
use of the ground floor and, with the removal of the second door and the cellar access stairs below the
central window gives only the appearance of odd openings with non-historic infill and serves no purpose
as a historic reference for an intermediate use of the building; and
D. The plain wooden door and the brick steps have no historic reference; and
E. With return to a one-family house it would be a more authentic treatment to return the facade to the
original historic appearance, retaining the horse walk door and the central window of historic size with a
double hung, multi-pane. punched window and to have an entrance door with period detailing and
brownstone steps, all in the original historic style of the building; and
F. Restoration of the upper facade, the lintels, the dormer, and the roof are in keeping with the historic
style of the building; and
G. The rear additions and the rear wall, represented by the applicant as not original, are to be demolished
and replace by a masonry extension with depths of 24’ at the basement and parlor floors, leaving ample
rear yard depth, and 8’ on the second and third floors and the rear dormer is to be raised to conform to
code; and
H. The rear windows are proposed to extend nearly the full width of the building and be glass folding
doors from floor to ceiling with minimal metal framing of no particular style and not in harmony with the
historic building; and
I. There is to be excavation in the cellar and a portion of the garden that retains a thickness of the existing
wall for security of the adjacent row house and to the wall of a large, contemporary building on the
opposite side and requires no underpinning and appears to present no peril to the building or adjoining
properties; now
Be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:
A. Approval of the front facade restoration above the ground floor; and
B. Denial of the design for the ground floor unless the horse walk door is retained, the central window is
a historic double hung window, the entrance door has historic detailing, and the steps are in brownstone
and the lower brownstone detailing extends to grade; all of which would together recreate the original
design; and
7C. Approval of the demolition of the non-historic rear wall, the extensions, and excavation of the cellar
and a portion of the garden, provided that care is taken to do no harm to the building or adjacent
properties; and
D. Denial of the rear windows and recommends that in their place, the basement and parlor floors have a
less industrial appearance and that the upper floors and the dormer have windows with a clear historical
reference.
Vote: Unanimous, 42 Board members in favor.
2ND LANDMARKS MEETING
7. *875 Washington St. – The application is to install two illuminated hanging blade signs
below the canopy at Washington Street and the 14th Street, install new metal louvers and
illuminated signs in front of and within the existing glass transoms at Washington Street and
14th Street, replace the existing storefront bay at the freight elevator, with a new brick wall
painted to match existing.
Whereas:
A. The premises is the entire Washington Street facade with portions on 13th and 14th Streets; and
B. The side of the freight elevator is to be infilled with brick matching the upper floors with a painted
logo on the brick matching a similar infill in another business in the building; and
C. The transom windows are to be fitted with dimensional “louvers” with individual illuminated,
dimmable lettering and the company logo above the entrances on Washington and 14th Streets.
D. Two hanging signs beneath the sheds, one on 14th Street and one on Washington Street 4’ X 18” and
3” thick with interior, dimmable illumination, represented by the applicant as being of size and design
similar to other signs in the immediate neighborhood; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends approval of this application as harmonious with
the building and the neighborhood.
Vote: Unanimous, 42 Board members in favor.
8. *17 W. 9th St. -Application is to restore front façade stoop and entrance, enlarge rear
façade windows, replace existing two top floor extensions at existing rear ‘L’ addition, add
elevator and stair bulkhead, extend chimneys, remove roof skylight, add roof railings, and
lower rear yard to align with lowered basement level.
Whereas:
A. The front facade windows are to be replaced in kind, through wall air conditioner window units
will be removed and the masonry will be restored; and
B. A stoop with typical stairs, a surround recalling the curved lintels of the windows above and wooden
door with small windows complement the facade with a welcome restoration of the original style
entrance; and
8C. The reintroduction of the stoop necessitates certain changes to the areaway together with other small
modifications and the iron work will be restored; and
D. The roof will have an elevator bulkhead, stair bulkhead, mechanical equipment, and glass railings in
the front and back and only the front railing is visible from a public thoroughfare; and
E. A non-visible skylight, much modified and not original to the building, is to be removed; and
F. The glass railing is out of harmony with the building and the district, and a metal railing would be less
obtrusive and much preferable; and
G. There is a window wall giving onto the enclosed garden on the basement level, a glass wall at the
parlor floor, and plate glass in the original punched openings in the exposed portion of the upper floors;
and,
H. The two additional floors above the existing extension are glass with bronze framing and the original
rear wall is preserved and is visible within the addition; and
H. The rear of the basement together with the garden are to be lowered 3’; and
J. The cellar is to be excavated approximately 5’ and there was no indication that excavation is required;
now

properties is required that it conform to all regulations and be done with the greatest of care to avoid any
damage to the house or the neighbors.
D. Approval in this exceptional case, of the plate glass in the upper floor punched openings to
harmonize with the glass below and in the “L”addition; and
E. Approval of the addition to the “L” with special commendation that the rear wall is visible within

PARKS AND WATERFRONT
A Resolution Regarding the Proposal to start a scoping process for the southern section of the lot at
388 Hudson St.
Whereas:
HISTORY OF THE SITE
91. In various letters and a 1998 Project Proposal letter, a commitment was made by the DEP to the
DPR and CB2, to return the entire City Water Tunnel #3 site (25,000sf) at 388 Hudson to the
community with DEP retaining only an easement for access as needed to maintain the site.
2. This commitment was the result of substantial advocacy by local community groups including
Greenwich Village Little League, Downtown United Soccer Club and City-As-School High
School. CB2, in a December 1998 resolution, supported this plan.
3. An important consideration for supporting this use was the unmet neighborhood need for places
for children to play sports.
4. CB2’s expectations and support were consistent over the next 17 years, but since 1998 access to
ballfields on the west side of lower Manhattan has increased substantially, with large new fields at
Pier 40, Chelsea Waterside Park, and Battery Parks City, and with the soon-to-be completed field
at Gansevoort Peninsula, while a large quantity of new housing units, though no affordable
housing, has been added to our district.
5. The 2013 Hudson Square rezoning established an Active Open Fund (Fund) to mitigate the
negative impact on active open space from new residential development, as defined in a March
2013 Restrictive Declaration.
6. In 2015, CB2 passed a resolution stating that it “strongly supports a substantial reduction of the
amount of promised public open space at the Hudson Street water tunnel shaft site (28b) so
affordable housing and indoor recreation can be developed there, but only if community open
space needs are addressed, and specifically, only if Elizabeth Street Garden is preserved as a
public park;”
7. In 2016, CB2 passed a resolution urging “the New York City Department of Housing and
Preservation Development to convene and co-lead with Community Board 2 a Task Force to
consider all possible sites and to establish and achieve bold goals for development of new
affordable housing in the District;”
8. This full site has been split into two sections (north and south) as outlined in a 2017 Memo Of
Understanding (MOU) between DEP and DPR. The MOU states that the northern section would
revert to the City’s Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) when the water-
tunnel construction project was completed.
9. In the August 2018 Department of City Planning (DCP) resolution supporting expansion of the
Hudson Square Business Improvement District (BID) north to Clarkson Street, the City mandated
the creation of an Active Open Space Special Improvement Fund which would be funded by a
one-time assessment by each property that was new, converted or enlarged in the Special Hudson
Square District on or after March 20, 2013. That 2018 DCP resolution allowed the Hudson Square
BID to manage these funds as the DMA (District Management Association). Allocation of these
funds would be determined by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation for active
recreation uses. That fund totals roughly $5.7 million as of June 30, 2022.
10. In January 2019, CB2 passed a resolution stating that it encouraged “the City to reconsider the
Alternative Site at 388 Hudson Street because it could support four to five times more Senior AH
[Affordable Housing] and preserve Elizabeth Street Garden, but because 388 Hudson Street was
promised a park for nearly 20 years, CB2 would support switching 388 Hudson from park to
affordable housing use only if the Garden is preserved in its entirety”.
CURRENT CONDITIONS
11. The complete site is now ready to be returned to the community. Currently, it is surrounded by
fencing and the southern parcel (11,375sf) is clear except for the DEP access points and air vents
which require permanent access for maintenance and in case of emergency. This places constraints
on uses of the space.
1012. NYC, Borough President Mark Levine and CB2 have previously identified the northern section
for affordable housing, though no definitive plans have been shared with CB2 to date.
13. On January 26, 2023, the DPR appeared before our committee and proposed starting a scoping
process for the southern section of the lot.
14. The DPR noted that the Mayor and Borough President have already allocated $2.6M of funding
for this project--separate from the Active Open Space Special Improvement Fund (AOSSIF)--
though the DPR feels the project would qualify to receive additional funding from the AOSSIF for
development.
15. The DPR suggested that the open space on the southern parcel, when complete, would be similar
in terms of features and design to the two other water tunnel sites already completed at East 4th at
Bowery and Grand & Lafayette.
16. The DPR reminded CB2 of the constraints on development of the space, due to DEP requiring
unfettered access to vents, access stairs and standing pipes.
17. DPR noted that the full project, from the start of scoping to development completion, can be
expected to take roughly three years.
18. DPR representatives were unable to definitively answer whether the full site (northern and
southern parcels) might someday become available as one contiguous open space; whether open
space on the southern parcel could be effectively designed without knowing future plans for the
northern parcel; whether the monies that the BID administers are permitted to be used for passive
(not active) recreation.
19. The closing of the Tony Dapolito Recreation Center--always a compromised facility for indoor
recreation, and now closed with no sure date for re-opening—has increased the need for a new
indoor recreation center.
Therefore, be it Resolved that CB 2, Manhattan supports starting the scoping of the southern area at
388 Hudson for what is likely to be a passive open space, though we believe that outdoor and/or indoor
space for active recreation is still required in our park-starved neighborhood, but seeks clarification on the
following items in a timely manner:
1. Reevaluation of the best uses for the Southern Parcel at 388 Hudson.
2. Consultation with DEP to determine the actual extent of the area needed for its access.
3. Clarification of the use limitations of the Active Open Space Special Improvement Fund: Is it only
able to be used for active recreation spaces or also for open space improvements more generally?
4. Specification of other potential receiving sites for the Active Open Space Special Improvement
Fund in the Hudson Square Rezoning Final Environment Impact Study (FEIS) area.
5. A “master plan” for the entire area, including the block where the Tony Dapolito Recreation
Center and James J Walker Field stand.
Be it further resolved that CB2 recommends that recognizing the access required by DEP on the southern
parcel, the design include as many active uses as possible, including for example, temporary structures
allowing for activities such as pickleball, basketball, or skateboarding.
Be it further resolved that CB2 advises that any scoping should include outreach to and the involvement
of local residents, local school communities -- including the adjacent City-As-School High School and
M721, Manhattan Occupational Training Center -- and local businesses.

SCHOOLS AND EDUCATION
1. Resolution on Pupil Transportation
Whereas, New York City public schools exist to serve all the city’s public school students; and
Whereas, in accordance with Chancellor’s Regulation A-801, the Department of Education (DOE)
provides transportation to all eligible New York City students in public, charter, and non-public schools.
12In partnership with the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) and our school-age and preschool bus
companies, our mission is to ensure safe and reliable transportation to and from school; and
Whereas, 150,000 NYC students attending public, charter, and non-public schools are eligible for pupil
transportation, including 65,000 students with IEPs and 6000 students in temporary housing; and
Whereas, Curb-to-school or specialized bus service is provided to students whose medical, health, or
disability-related conditions or special circumstances prevent them from being able to walk or utilize
other forms of transportation to get to and from school; and
Whereas, under the DOE Transportation Rights, students should expect Dependable and timely school
bus service, travel on a school bus that is properly equipped and inspected for safety, including an
inspection by the NYS Department of Transportation performed every six (6) months, and the shortest
and safest bus route to minimize travel times to and from school; and
Whereas, NY City Council’s 2022 Year In Review summarizes their hearing on School Bus
Transportation Services, with links to the recording of the event and to the existing laws on OPT
reporting; and
Whereas, Manhattan Community Board 4 ACES Committee held a public hearing on school bus service
(which included interviews with PIST and OPT), the outcome of which was a letter to Mayor Adams, the
NYC Comptroller, and others, advising an audit of pupil transportation and consideration of expanding
non-profit NYCSBUS; and
Whereas, for a safe environment free from discrimination, harassment, and bullying; in accordance with
Chancellor’s Regulation A-832 any such incidents should be reported to their school’s Respect for All
liaison (RFA) or emailed to RespectforAll@schools.nyc.gov; and
Whereas, families can report any behavioral or safety incident on the school bus to their school for
documentation and appropriate follow-up and filing a complaint to initiate an unbiased investigation
performed by the appropriate investigatory unit or agency; and timely resolution of any complaints and/or
concerns; and
Whereas, in summer of 2021 and 2022 the DOE, having failed to provide school bus service to students
mandated for summer/extended school instruction, offered free car service for Students with disabilities
and students in temporary housing in order to attend the Summer Rising program. In summer of 2022
most families were not aware of the rideshare options and very few families were able to make use of this
accommodation due to the lack of communication and numerous technical glitches; and
Whereas, in March 2021, DOE announced a long-term investment in student bus transportation in the
acquisition of Reliant Transportation and the establishment of the non-profit organization New York City
School Bus Umbrella Services Inc. (NYCSBUS) to service 950 school-age bus routes annually for the
DOE; and
Whereas, during Chapter 683 (a federally funded program that pays Special Education schools to provide
year-round instruction. In New York City it is District 75 schools who provide instruction for the most
severely disabled students in the New York City Public Schools), families who rely on summer programs
for mandated 12-month services encountered numerous instances of late pick-ups, no social distancing on
minibuses, children dropped off at the wrong location/site, children reported lost for numerous hours and
reports of busses with no functioning air conditioning when the outside temperatures were well over 80
degrees; and
13Whereas, during Chapter 683 (a federally funded program that pays Special Education schools to provide
year-round instruction. In New York City it is District 75 schools that provide instruction for the most
severely disabled students in the New York City Public Schools), families who rely on summer programs
for mandated 12-month services encountered numerous instances of late pick-ups, no social distancing on
minibuses, children dropped off at the wrong location/site, children reported lost for numerous hours and
reports of buses with no functioning air conditioning when the outside temperatures were well over 80
degrees; and
Whereas, despite numerous promises from OPT that busses would be in place for the first day of the
2022-2023 school year, parents still reported children not being picked up, children being lost,
excessively long travel times, wheelchair-bound students not being provided vehicles with chairlifts, and
overcrowded minibuses with no air conditioning or proper ventilation; and
Whereas, during Chapter 683 thousands of families were stranded for almost 3 weeks waiting for a bus
route to be assigned, missing mandated instruction and other in-person services and being forced to pivot
to remote learning; and
Whereas, only 40% of NYC families have established New York City Schools Account (NYCSA)
accounts and the rest were unable to access busing information when in the past, OPT sent busing
information as a written notice 10 days prior to school starting; and
Whereas, incoming kindergarten families did not have access to busing information since NYCSA
accounts are only established once the students are enrolled, nor did non-public school families, leaving
tens of thousands of students stranded without access; and
Whereas, the staffing of bus paraprofessionals is an immense obstacle in the transportation of our
students leaving many unable to board their assigned bus; and
Whereas, the extent of late, no-show, merged and doubled-up routes in Summer to Fall 2022 can partly
be explained by the shortage of licensed school bus drivers throughout New York and other states, a
problem that reflects nine years of NYCDOE allowing routes to be put out for bid without an Employee
Protection Provisions (EPP) compensation package for the workers; and
Whereas, New York Appleseed released in April 2022 an extensive research briefing on the history of
the New York City Yellow Bus Service and the impact of workers going on Strike due to the lack of
Employee Protection Provisions (EPP) that is not sustainable under the national Bus driver shortage; and
Whereas, Metrocards intended for families and students in Temporary Housing as well as High School
students for pupil transportation have not been distributed and sometimes unavailable, leaving students
very little choice but to crawl under the turnstile in order to get home, making them vulnerable to §165.15
Theft of Service law, which makes the “intent to obtain…public transportation service without payment”
punishable up to one year in jail; and
Whereas CECD2 passed Resolution 194 on 4/12/22 advising MetroCard usage times for traveling to and
from school and school-related activities be expanded to board a bus or enter the subway up to 4 times per
day between 5:30 AM and 10:00 PM; and
Whereas, School bus delays spiked this fall to levels higher than any point in the last five years,
according to figures revealed during a City Council hearing Monday Nov 21, 2022, representing a
growing hardship for families who depend on yellow buses to get their children to school.; and
14Whereas, in October 2022 alone, there were nearly 14,500 school bus delays, lasting 41 minutes on
average. That’s up from about 10,600 delays averaging 37 minutes in October 2021 reported to the media
that bus shortages left families with no bus routes for the entire school for several days, forcing families to
take time off from work in order to transport their children; and
Whereas, parents have the right to receive information or communicate with a staff member at their
school or Department of Education (DOE) office in their language regarding any and all matters related to
transportation; and
Whereas, these language barriers and technology constraints place an undue burden on families that are
already struggling.
Therefore Be It Resolved Community Board 2 Manhattan (CB2) implores the DOE to prioritize
expanding quality NYCSBUS from the current 950 bus routes in order to service the 150,000 students
eligible for transportation; and
Be It Resolved that CB2 ask attendance to be collected on the number of students excluded from rightful
service due to busing deficiencies and that those data be made public and disaggregated by borough and
by district; and
Be It Resolved that CB2 ask that OPT takes initiative to prioritize students who require a specialized
learning classroom environment, particularly for students experiencing in behavioral challenges and/or
safety concerns, for the ‘fewer students on route’ accommodation in regard to transportation; and
Be It Resolved that CB2 demands a more stringent oversight of OPT practices including but not limited
to a reporting system of when site visits to bus companies are done, when bus inspections and repairs are
cataloged, a transparent record of specialized vehicles and routes for students in need of ambulatory
services, and how many routes are assigned to one driver; and
Be It Resolved that CB2 ask that a pilot program for the recruitment, training and nomination of sub-
paras strictly for the use of servicing students in need of bus paras be created under the supervision of the
District 75 Superintendent to allow a faster expedition of the sub para nomination process and allow more
parents to apply; and
Be It Resolved that CB2 demands that OPT improve training for all drivers and attendants. Uniformity in
training including first aid, car seats, disability awareness/acceptance, bullying, and how to do bus
evacuation drills. Update the modules parents created years ago; allow parent leaders to vet the training
vendors and to do quality control visits or presentations to training in progress; and
Be It Resolved that CB2 demand a more transparent and accessible complaint system for families and
schools to report instances of no pickup, maintenance issues, missing children, safety concerns, and
infractions on safety protocols; and
Be It Resolved that CB2 ask for OPT to acknowledge and study the deficiencies that occurred during
Summer Rising and Chapter 683 and schedule discussions with stakeholders on how to staff and problem
solve promptly without relying only on a possible extension of any car service contract in anticipation of
unmet student transportation needs; and
15Be It Resolved that CB2 ask that OPT maximize climate control on the vehicles, preferably with clean
HVAC technology that is at least as energy efficient as New York City MTA buses used in public
transportation; and
Be It Resolved that CB2 ask that OPT shorten the maximum route duration times and create routes that
adhere to them; enforce limited time travel where granted by an IEP; and
Be It Resolved that CB2 demands OPT to proactively inform families (thru backpack mail, email, social
media and information sessions) and schools on transportation rights including how to get
accommodations; publish the different accommodations available and the codes to support the school
based transportation liaisons on the Transportation section of the DOE website; how to add yellow bus
service when changing schools or housing, especially for those residing in family residences; how to
lodge a complaint; and how to seek a variance. We also ask that all forms and information are accessible
and available in any language the DOE serves; and
Be It Resolved that CB2 demands that every student living more than .5 miles from their school has
access to a monthly unlimited MetroCard for afterschool, mandated internships and programs, sports, and
other education obligations; and
Be It Finally Resolved that CB2 demands the creation of a school transportation oversight committee
made up of parents, paras, and DOE representatives of each sector that is tasked with implementing OPT
policies and troubleshooting i.e. transportation coordinators, routers, principals to mitigate and mediate all
concerns related to the functions of OPT.
Vote: Unanimous, 43 Board Members in favor.
2. Resolution to Expand MetroCard Availability, Hours & OMNY Accessibility
Whereas, schools distribute student MetroCards to eligible students at the beginning of each semester,
and as needed during the school year;
Whereas, students can use the school distributed MetroCard at every subway and local bus;
Whereas, student MetroCards are:
• Distinct and separate from MetroCards sold to the public,
• Only able to be used for three trips each school day; allowing middle and high school
students to travel to school, from school to an after-school activity, and from that activity
home,
• Only to be used by the student to whom it was assigned,
• For use for school and school-related activities between 5:30AM and 8:30PM only on days
when the student’s school is open for classes (generally Monday-Friday),
• Valid for one school semester; new cards are issued at the beginning of each semester by
schools; and
Whereas, many schools hold Saturday classes for academic intervention; academic & sporting events and
practices are often held on the weekends across the city; and
Whereas, students and families must absorb any transportation costs for students to travel for school-
related activities on weekends; and
16Whereas, many extracurricular activities, especially for high school students, can run beyond the current
8:30PM curfew for MetroCard usage, and on weekends; and
Whereas, schools have access to one-day, two-trip MetroCards, that can and be given to students for
weekend use as needed and required if use of MetroCards cannot be extended to the weekends; and
Whereas, the logistics and required tracking of two-trip MetroCards is an unnecessary burden on schools;
and
Whereas, the phone-based One Metro New York (OMNY) system for mass transit is currently not
available for student travel.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that Community Board 2 (CB2) urges MetroCard usage times for
traveling to and from school and school-related activities be expanded to board a bus or enter the subway
up to 4 times per day between 5:30AM and 10:00PM, every day of the week; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that CB2 encourages the NYC MTA to enable high school students to
be allowed to use the new phone-based One Metro New York (OMNY) system for their public
transportation, enabling them to use school funds for their travel without the complication of MetroCards.

37TRAFFIC AND TRANSPORTATION
Resolution in response to panel discussion of experts addressing obscured license plates and their
impact on the loss of revenue due to their evasion of red-light cameras, speed cameras and tolls, the
dangers vehicles with obscured license plates pose to public safety, and the lack of sufficient
enforcement.
Whereas the practice of drivers obscuring license plates to avoid being caught by red light and speed
cameras when they speed, run red lights and tolls is proliferating in the NYC area, greatly endangering all
people on the street and, as reported by local representatives, have cost tax payers millions of dollars
(NYC Dept. of Transportation (DOT) data March 2020-April 2022: 1.5 million obscured license plate
incidents reported; by 2021 up to 4% of vehicles evading cameras representing a $75,000,000 loss); and
Whereas offenders obscure license plates in many different ways, among them, by scraping off paint,
with covers or objects, with spray paint, by retracting license plates, by forging fake plates and by using
false paper substitutes for the real plates; and
Whereas fines for illegally obstructed license plates are as little as $65 with a maximum up to $300,
resulting in $75 to $100 million a year in lost revenue; and,
Whereas intentionally obscured plates undermine the Reckless Driver Accountability Act that is designed
to penalize reckless drivers with 15 or more camera-issued speeding tickets or five red-light tickets and
keep them and their vehicles off NYC streets; and
Whereas it is illegal to buy or sell devices that obscure license plates (Amazon is no longer allowed to
sell obscured plates shipped to NY addresses) yet it remains possible to buy them in stores and online if
shipped out of state; and
Whereas when congestion pricing goes into effect, scofflaws would look to avoid paying tolls by
obscuring their license plates, leading to a reduction of the revenue that congestion pricing is designed to
raise and less impact on its aim to lower congestion; and
Whereas it has been established that drivers obscuring their plates are known to be the most egregious
offenders when it comes to reckless driving that can lead to serious if not fatal injuries; and
Whereas the 1st and 5th Precinct of the NYPD say they are actively targeting vehicles with obscured
plates and finding that this leads to additional criminal charges as many drivers caught with obscured
license plates are found and charged with illegal possession of guns, knives, drugs, and other contraband;
and
Whereas license plates are regulated by the State of New York which complicates NYPD’s ability to
impound parked cars with obscured license plates; and
Whereas areas around police precincts are known to have one of the highest ratios of parked cars with
obscured license plates; and,
Whereas NYPD enforces its own officers with obscured license plates offenses under the rule of
Command Discipline, penalizing those officers who own cars with obscured plates by taking away
vacation days, as opposed to issuing fines that can be tracked with the payment of a summons; and
38Whereas NYS Governor Kathy Hochul has proposed legislation in her FY 2024 Executive Budget that
will authorize law enforcement and the Department of Motor Vehicles to levy increased penalties on
drivers whose license plates are knowingly altered to make them unreadable in photographs, including
increased fines and registration denials. The law will also enable law enforcement to seize materials
affixed to license plates that are designed to prevent them from being read by speed and toll collection
cameras; and
Whereas NYS Senators Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Andrew Gounardes will be reintroducing legislation by
Senator Gounardes from the 2021-2022 NYS Legislative Session to the current NYS Legislative Session
that would direct municipalities to create a program for bystander reporting of stolen, false or fraudulent
license plates; and
Whereas NYC Council Member Erik Bottcher introduced a bill at the NYC Council Legislative Session
in 2022, to be re-introduced at the Council's 2023 Legislative Session, to require the NYC Department of
Transportation (DOT) to report monthly on evasion of red-light cameras or school speed cameras by
motor vehicles with unreadable license plates;
Therefore be it resolved that CB2 strongly supports Governor Hochul's proposal to increase fines on
drivers who obscure their license plates and calls upon the NY State legislature to support and speedily
pass this legislation; and
Be it further resolved that CB2 strongly supports reintroduction at this current NY State legislative
session of State Senator Gounardes' 2021-2022 bill formalizing a public reporting process for obscured
license plates, which now will be co-sponsored by State Senators Gounardes and Hoylman-Sigal, and
calls upon the NY State Legislature, when this bill is reintroduced, to pass the bill as soon as possible; and
Be it further resolved that CB2 agrees that the fine for obscuring a license plate should be severe,
whether ticketed in motion or parked, with a minimum fine set in the hundreds of dollars with the option
to impound the vehicle; and
Be it further resolved that CB2 strongly supports NYC Council Member Bottcher's bill mandating DOT
to report on speed and red-light camera evasions and urges that it be quickly brought to the Council's
Transportation Committee and approved and to the full NYC Council to review and swiftly vote passage;
and
Be it further resolved that CB2 recommends stricter disciplinary measures for police officers caught
with obscured license plates, and proposes that NYPD offenders be handed the same punishment as other
citizens, rather than subtracting vacation days, which is more difficult to audit; and
Be it finally resolved that CB2 urges New York City and New York State to research and institute as
soon as possible new technology to replace license plates as visual identifiers, creating license plates with
new technology that would make toll evasion, red light camera running and speeding more difficult to
hide
Vote: Passed, 38 Board Members in favor, and 4 in opposition (J. Deverna, R. Sanz, S. Smith, C.

2 Recusals (M. Metzger and S. Secunda)
LANDMARKS AND PUBLIC AESTHETICS
1. *79-81 Charles Street - Application to modify the areaways and railings, excavate the cellar and
rear yard, construct a rear yard addition, and construct a rooftop addition.
Whereas:
A. 79 and 81 Charles Street are an integral part of a row of seven 19th century houses, each of which
possesses a small measure of individuation within their overall unified appearance; and
B. The restoration of the front façade, including the proposed changes to the areaway, the new railing
at 81, the cornice restoration, the 2 over 2 wood frame windows, and the restoration of each
property’s distinctive newel posts, is entirely respectful of the context of both houses and within the
row; and
C. The proposal is sensitive to the importance of maintaining the characteristic rhythm of visual
individuation and distinction of each house, and
D. The rear and rooftop additions proposed for 81 are similar in massing to a previously approved
application, and
E. The rear and rooftop additions on 79, with the exception of the basement window that is shared
with 81, confirm the individual identity of each house; and
F. As demonstrated by the mock-up and as described by the applicant, other than flues, the rooftop
additions do not seem to be visible from any public thoroughfare; and
7G. The excavation of the rear yard is well within the property lines, providing a buffer to adjoining
properties, and commendably is covered in sufficient soil to provide for plantings, including new
trees; and;
H. The historic plaque commemorating Hart Crane’s residence at 79 will remain; now
Therefore, be it resolved that Manhattan CB2 approves the proposal in its entirety and commends the
applicant on their conscious effort to maintain visually appropriate individuation of each property.
Vote: Unanimous, with 39 Board Members in favor.
QUALITY OF LIFE: STREET ACTIVITIES
1. Resolution providing CB2 comment as part of the initial public comment period for the Tier
1 Environmental Impact Study (“EIS”) and Tentatively Selected Plan (“TSP”) of the US
Army Corps of Engineers (“USACE”) New York / New Jersey Harbors and Tributaries
(“NYNJHAT”) Study.
Study Background
1. Whereas, following Superstorm Sandy in 2012, President Obama signed into law the Disaster
Appropriations Act of 2013 to assist in the recovery in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy; and
2. Whereas, the Disaster Appropriations Act authorized the US Army Corps of Engineers
(“USACE”) to commence the North Atlantic Coast Comprehensive Study in order to study coastal
storm risk management strategies, which was completed in 2015 and which identified the New
York / New Jersey Harbors and Tributaries (“NYNJHAT”) area as one of three focus areas; and
3. Whereas, USACE embarked upon the NYNJHAT study in partnership with the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation (“NYSDEC”) and the New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection (“NJDEP”), and NYC, a cost-sharing agreement being executed
amongst these entities in 2016; and
4. Whereas, following years of work on the study, including the release of an interim report in 2019,
the USACE released in September 2022 the study’s final Tier 1 Environmental Impact Study
(“EIS”) and Tentatively Selected Plan (“TSP”); and
Current Project Timeline
5. Whereas, a public comment period has now been opened for the Tier 1 EIS and the TSP, and is
currently set to close on March 7th, 2023, following an extension announced in December from the
original public comment period closing date of January 6th, 2023; and
6. Whereas, as part of this public comment period, representatives from the USACE presented to
CB2’s Quality of Life (“QoL”) committee on the evening of November 7th, 2022; and
87. Whereas, following USACE’s presentation on November 7th, CB2 Manhattan approved a
resolution in November calling for an extension of this public comment period – which has now
been granted – to allow for broader and more meaningful community engagement; and
8. Whereas, the proposed timeline following the initial comment period contemplates a chief-of-
engineers report to be released in mid-2024, followed by a Tier 2 EIS, a design phase lasting from
2024-2030, the start of construction in 2030, and the completion of the project by 2044; and
Overview of Tentatively Selected Plan and Impacts to CD2
9. Whereas, the USACE chose as their Tentatively Selected Plan (“TSP”) Alternative 3B out of the
range of alternatives considered, which includes a series of multi-basin storm surge barriers along
with Shore-Based Measures (“SBMs”) across New York City (including CD2), New Jersey, and
other New York counties outside of NYC; and;
10. Whereas, at 2022 price levels, the TSP has an estimated upfront cost of approximately $52.6
Billion, of which 65% would be federally funded and 35% would be funded non-federally, with
additional maintenance costs throughout the expected life of the constructed infrastructure
amounting to approximately $23 Billion, all of which would be funded non-federally; and
11. Whereas, the report released in September 2022 comprises a 569-page main report1, and
thousands of total pages across a range of appendices and sub-appendices; and
12. Whereas, amongst the various sub-areas within the NYNJHAT study region, lower Manhattan,
including parts of Community District 2, is specifically impacted under the TSP, with a range of
Shore-Based Measures (“SBMs”) proposed running along the west side of Manhattan all the way
up to 34th street, including the entire CD2 shoreline from Canal Street to 14th Street; and
13. Whereas, the SBMs initially proposed along the CD2 shoreline under the TSP consist of a series
of 20+ foot high floodwalls and deployable barriers running parallel to the shoreline, from Canal
to 14th street, and a proposed seawall around the Gansevoort Peninsula (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 2
below); and
Fig. 1: NYC West Side Shore-Based Measures (SBMs) – Jane Street to 34th Street

9Fig. 2: NYC West Side Shore-Based Measures (SBMs) – Chambers Street to Jane Street
1014. Whereas, when asked about the specific siting and design features of the SBMs planned along
CD2’s shoreline, USACE representatives stated that the exact location of the SBMs vis-à-vis the
existing waterfront condition is not to be determined until a later phase, even though the map
included in the TSP appears to show SBMs on top of the existing bike path; and
15. Whereas, while specific design schematics are included in the report appendices for the various
SBMs within CD2 (see Fig. 3, Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 below), USACE representatives indicated that
more specific detail as to the actual design of the SBMs would be determined during the Design
Phase beginning in 2024; and
Fig. 3: SBM Large Floodwall Cross-Section
Fig. 4: SBM Extra-Large Floodwall Cross-Section
11Fig. 5 - Roller Gate (Deployable Barrier) Cross Section
12Issues to Be Addressed
16. Whereas, while CB2 understands that many aspects of the plan for SBMs along CD2’s waterfront
are still in the early stages, it is clear that should the plan move forward as it is currently designed,
it would have an unprecedented and substantial impact on the waterfront along the west side, with
a 20+ foot floodwall completely transforming and re-defining the community and the public at
large’s access to the waterfront (see Fig. 6 below for a rough rendition of such floodwall); and
Fig. 6: Rough Rendition of Floodwall along West Street
17. Whereas, as outlined in CB2’s prior November 2022 resolution on this topic, it is CB2’s view that
several key constituencies need to be promptly and meaningfully engaged during the public
comment period, including the Hudson River Park Trust, which has jurisdiction over Hudson
River Park, comprising all of the shoreline within CD2, and the New York State Department of
Transportation, which has jurisdiction over State Route 9A (i.e. the “West Side Highway”)
running along the west side of CD2, just to the east of Hudson River Park; and
1318. Whereas, there are a clearly a range of other relevant factors that are outside the scope of the
USACE study that are nonetheless likely to have an impact on the planning and construction of
the TSP, or any other future resiliency measures on the west side, going forward; and
19. Whereas, as part of the initial public comment period on the TSP, CB2 Manhattan believes it
would be prudent to outline in detail the range of issues and concerns currently foreseen by the
Community Board as well as members of the public, which could broadly be classified into
categories of Process, Content, Engagement and External Factors; now
Therefore Be It Resolved that CB2 Manhattan seeks to provide comment on the Tier 1 Environmental
Impact Study (“EIS”) and Tentatively Selected Plan (“TSP”) of the US Army Corps of Engineers
(“USACE”) New York / New Jersey Harbors and Tributaries (“NYNJHAT”) Study ahead of the current
expected public comment closing date of March 7th, 2023; and
Therefore Be It Further Resolved that given the current stage of the project, CB2 Manhattan believes it
most prudent at this time to provide a list of issues and concerns voiced by the Board and the community,
which broadly fall into the categories of Process, Content, Engagement and External Factors and are
outlined below:
Process
o Ensuring full engagement of community boards at all parts of the process
o Clear outlining of the project timeline in more detail at the appropriate time
o Ensuring that there is a clear outline for involvement of non-federal partners - New York
State Department of Environmental Conservation (“NYSDEC”) and the New Jersey
Department of Environmental Protection (“NJDEP”), and NYC
o Outlining the legislative process for funding the project
o Providing more clarity on what the Tier 2 Environmental Impact Study (“EIS”) will look
like
o Promptly engaging key constituents including HRPT and State DoT as outlined in the
“Engagement” section
Content / Design
o Ensuring that green infrastructure is included where possible and relevant
o Considering alternatives to the “concrete wall” solution – including “flip-up” barriers (such
as those being built currently in the two bridges area) and deployable barriers that could be
stored offsite (in an area such as Pier 40) and brought into place ahead of a storm
o In addition to green infrastructure, consideration of other multi-benefit infrastructure that
could be used - i.e. other benefits that can be leveraged from the investment other than
direct storm surge protection
o Ensuring strong consideration of drainage issues – resilience to heavy rain events that
don’t necessarily include a storm surge – as well as “normal” non-storm flooding due to
sea level rise
o Consideration of other climate/environmental risks impacting CD2 that could be
considered including heat and air pollution
14o Clarification of the exact location of the SBMs
o Clarification on how much of the design of the SBMs is open to modification and what the
process for such modification would be
o Consideration of the significant amount of disruption that would occur to Hudson River
Park and the waterfront on the west side should flood walls be constructed as currently
proposed – given the narrow width of Hudson River Park in many areas, such construction
would be highly disruptive to the park itself, to the bike lane and to the west side highway
o Consideration of traffic impact - construction is likely to cause disruption around already
high traffic areas such as the Holland Tunnel with cascading impact
o An overall consideration of the “cost” of the project – what is the cost of the severe impact
to a valuable amenity like the Hudson River Park and the cost of cutting it off the shoreline
from the community with a 20+ foot wall, both during and after the construction phase
Engagement
o Prompt and ongoing engagement of Hudson River Park Trust
o Prompt and ongoing engagement of State DoT
o Engagement of community boards in all parts of the process (as outlined in the “Process”
section)
o Engaging with State DoT and ConEd to conduct a study of relevant infrastructure
underneath the west side highway and Hudson River Park, as this is likely to have a major
impact on the project’s timeline and design
o Comparing the current design against other locations globally of where similar projects
have been undertaken and sharing such comparison with the public
o Working on ways to make the project more accessible to the public, given the extreme
length of the report which runs into the thousands of pages including appendices
o Helping community boards and other relevant community stakeholders find ways to
incentivize the engagement of elected officials in this process
External Factors
o Learning and sharing with the community more detail about the current infrastructure
situation under the west side highway and Hudson River Park – including the makeup of
the ground/soil, location of conduits, electrical lines, sewage, etc., all of which will have a
major impact on project design and construction
o Considering the impact of the project on the bike lane expansion which has been
previously proposed along the west side highway
o Considering the possible impact of congestion pricing on the project, given that the west
side highway is a major thoroughfare
o Considering issues of emergency access along the west side highway, during the
construction phase as well as after the project is completed

– Emily in Little Paris Event (Sponsor: GSS Security Services, Inc.): Centre St. between Grand
St. and Broome St. (Note: A 5ft. Pedestrian walkway on the sidewalk will be maintained at all
times.) (Sidewalk and Curb Lane Closure)
Whereas, the applicant is seeking to organize an activation on behalf of the Netflix television show

referred to in various media as “Little Paris” and which currently features a “Little Paris” street sign on

Whereas, the activation will feature substantial security, with 14 security guards expected to be present
during each of the three days of the activation; and
Whereas, the CB2 Quality of Life committee, as well as members of the public, raised a number of
concerns regarding issues of safety, complexity and community impact, including that:
• The plans for the event did not seem to reflect the current state of the street including locations of
dining sheds
• The street itself would not be closed to traffic despite aspects of the activation occurring on both
sides of the street, which would likely lead to attendees attempting to cross mid-block across
traffic
• The location of multiple vendor carts and seating areas on the sidewalk is likely to be an
impediment to pedestrian traffic; and
17Whereas, the applicant submitted an application to SAPO which classified the event as a “Street Event,
Medium” which per New York City Rules allowed for a submission deadline of 30 days before the event;
and
Whereas, in the case of this application, the submission date was November 11th, just over 30 days before
the proposed start date of the event, which prevents the event from being fully subject to Community
Board review, as the submission occurred after the November 7th CB2 Quality of Life meeting and the
event will occur before the December 20th CB2 full board meeting; and
Whereas, the committee voiced concern about being granted the ability to review such an impactful and
complex event only a few days before the event is scheduled to begin, as well as the fact that the full
board would not have the ability to review or pass a resolution on such event; and
Whereas, such timing issues have previously prevented CB2 from passing resolutions on other events
apart from this specific event, and will likely to be an issue going forward, unless certain changes are
made to the Rules and/or SAPO processes; and
Whereas, possible options available to the City in order to allow for greater and more impactful
Community Board input on events in the community could be to extend application deadlines and/or
apply more scrutiny to event sizing classifications; now
Therefore Be It Resolved that CB2 Manhattan laments the inability to pass a resolution and/or provide
meaningful guidance to the applicant on this application given the timing of application submission vis-à-
vis the timing of CB2 meetings and the event itself.
Therefore Be It Further Resolved that CB2 Manhattan asks that SAPO/CECM consider revising the
street activity application process to allow for timely Community Board review through a possible
extension of application deadlines and/or more clarity/scrutiny over the classification of street event sizes.

11:00 PM daily, with the proposed restaurant closing at 1:00 AM Sundays through Thursdays and
2:00 AM Fridays and Saturdays; while there was much support from both the committee and
community for the Wegmans food market, concerns were raised regarding the logistics of closing the
restaurant later than the food market, of particular concern was bathroom access, there being just one
(1) bathroom / stall in the restaurant itself for an occupancy of 110 persons which is in contradiction
of the NYSLA requirement that there be at least two (2) bathrooms; additional concerns were the
logistics of closing the food market itself but leaving the main entrance open for patrons to access the
restaurant entrance, there being no direct access to the restaurant from the street; additional concerns
were raised regarding the late night operating hours for the restaurant, the restaurant being an
accessory use to the food market and the public interest in having the restaurant open while the
market was closed with there being 28 active licenses within 750' of the proposed premises to be
licensed seemed negligible and potentially harmful to those already established businesses; and
v. Whereas, members of both the committee and the public also commented on their disappointment at
the loss of the subway entrance that was located on the interior of the premises when Kmart occupied
the premises, the Applicant explaining it was logistically not possible to keep due to the layout of the
food market and related check-out counters, that there was an entrance directly across the street that
they felt was sufficient; and
vi. Whereas, this application being subject to the 500 foot rule requiring the Applicant to demonstrate
that the public interest would be served by adding another liquor license at this location, there being
28 active licensed premises and three (3) pending within 750 feet of the subject premises, the
Applicant agreeing to closing the restaurant at the same time or earlier than the market and executing
a stipulations agreement with Community Board 2 Manhattan for the sole purpose of establishing
public interest, the stipulations being attached to and incorporated into the license, limiting its
method of operation on the On-Premises Liquor License for this purpose, as follows:

i. Whereas, the Applicants and the Applicant’s Attorney appeared before Community Board 2,
Manhattan’s SLA Licensing Committee to present an application to the NYS Liquor Authority for a new
On-Premises Liquor License to operate a restaurant in a semi-sub surface storefront within a five-story
mixed-use tenement style building (c. 1900) on West 14th Street St. between 7th and 8th Avenues in
Greenwich Village; and
ii. Whereas, the ground floor storefront proposed to be licensed was previously operated as a
restaurant known as Crooked Knife, the storefront being roughly 2,700 sq. ft. consisting of a 1600 sq. ft.
below grade ground floor and 1100 sq. ft. subbasement, the subbasement being for storage, boiler, and
office uses only, there is no patron use of the subbasement, the interior storefront having a full service
kitchen with 21 tables with 53 patron seats, one (1) seventeen foot stand up bar without any designated
bar seating for a total seated patron occupancy of 53 seats; the premises has one (1) entry/exit with an
exterior staircase leading down from the public sidewalk which serves as the only patron ingress and
egress and one (1) bathroom; and
iii. Whereas, the Applicants also seek to operate in a large rear yard space from the interior storefront
through a single rear doorway and staircase, the applicant indicating the unmeasured rear yard is roughly
1500 sq. ft., with 12 large picnic style tables and 52 exterior patron seats, the rear storefront also having a
row of operable casement windows that open out into the rear yard; and
iv. Whereas, the proposed hours of operation are from 4:00 PM to 4:00 AM Monday through Friday
and from 11:00 AM to 4:00 AM on Saturdays and Sundays, and for the exterior rear yard the proposed
hours are from 6:00 PM to 12:00 AM Monday through Friday and from 11:00 AM to 12:00 AM on
Saturdays and Sundays; music for the interior will include live music and live DJs on the weekends but
despite the live music and DJS the applicants insist that music levels will be quiet background only, with
the live music being acoustical jazz music without amplification, and there will be no dancing, no
promoted events, no scheduled performances or cover fees; and
44v. Whereas, the applicant provided a certificate of occupancy for 232 West 14th St. from 2018
which did not state nor permit eating and drinking use or occupancy to the exterior rear yard and placed a
maximum capacity for the interior sub grade cellar level storefront at 64 persons, with concerns being
raised as to the sufficiency of the emergency egress from the rear yard and premises to be licensed
through the individual doorways and stairwells located at both the front and rear of the premise proposed
to be licensed, with the proposed occupancy being in excess of that permitted, there also being no public
assembly permit being presented demonstrating the proposed occupancy was reviewed by the NYCFD;
and,
vi. Whereas, residents living adjacent to and directly exposed to the premises and rear yard proposed
to be licensed appeared on this application opposing the use of the rear yard, explaining that during the
COVID pandemic the predecessor restaurant in the same space (the Crooked Knife) tore down a fence
separating the two rear yards of 232 West 14th St. and the neighboring building at 234 West 14th St., and
without filing any alteration to its existing license with the NYSLA, or seeking permission from the NYC
Department of Buildings, had placed tables and seats in the adjacent rear yard and was using both rear
yards for eating/drinking and the of service alcohol, with such use and occupancy being in derogation of
the terms of its liquor license, while also creating significant intrusions of noise and privacy to their
quality of life, with their bedrooms and living quarters facing a rear donut consisting of numerous
residential buildings, all of which are exposed to the use of the large rear yards belonging to both these
two buildings (232 and 234 W. 14th) with the prior operators also having left their windows open in the
rear, playing excessively loud music creating further, unreasonable intrusions on those living in the
immediate rear donut, the applicants indicating that the ownership of the two buildings are by the same
ownership entity; and,
vii. Whereas, this application being subject to the 500 foot rule requiring the Applicant to
demonstrate that the public interest would be served by the addition of another late night license
establishment at this location, the immediate area already being greatly saturated with late-night drinking
establishments and liquor licenses, there being 50 active on premise liquor licenses within 750 feet of the
location proposed to be licensed, with 4 additional pending licenses, the proposal of operating until 4 AM
being inconsistent with the Applicant’s statements and application that it seeks to operate as a full service
restaurant, the use/occupancy of the rear yard for eating and drinking not being allowed, with valid
concerns having been raised as to patron occupancy levels which must include patrons eating/drinking in
the rear yard, as well as emergency egress to and though multiple single doorways coupled with staircases
on either sides of those doorways, the Applicant not willing to withdraw the rear yard from the instant
application, or operate with more appropriate hours consistent with that of a full service restaurant, with
this particular block already being greatly saturated with late night licensed establishments; and
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that Community Board 2, Manhattan recommends denial of the
application for a new On Premise Liquor License for 232 14th Street, LLC d/b/a Between Us, 234 West
14th Street Cellar & Sub-Bsmt. 10011; and,

1. Resolution in response to presentation by the Meatpacking BID of an update on their ongoing
Western Gateway study.
Whereas the Meatpacking Business Improvement District (MPD) presented an update of their ongoing
Western Gateway study, last presented to Community Board 2 Manhattan (CB2) in May 2022, now with
a more developed vision in view of the input and feedback from that May 2022 meeting as well as from
outreach to block associations, property owners, businesses, community organizations and other
stakeholders and neighborhood representatives, and with the expectation that more details focusing on
specific location segments will come in future presentations; and
Whereas the update addressed the study's scope area as previously presented (Horatio St. to the south, W.
17th St. to the north, 8th Ave. to the east and the Hudson River to the west), as well as both interim and
subsequent capital improvements being considered for the six individual project areas included therein
(14th St. and 10th Ave. Interchange; 10th Ave./Meatpacking Cooperative (W. 13th and Little W. 12th
Sts.); Gansevoort Landing at 10th Ave. (the first of the envisioned programmiatic pilots/interim projects
48undertaken by DOT and approved by CB2); Washington St.; 14th St, Gateway; and Chelsea Market
Streets (this not within CB2)); and
Whereas CB2 appreciates the conduct of physical and data analysis of pedestrians and bicycles, vehicular
volume, street safety, transit connectivity, traffic flow, and curbside use (plus stakeholder outreach) for
this study with WXY Architecture + Urban Design and Sam Schwartz Engineering (civil engineers),
long-time, well recognized professional practitioners in their fields with extensive experience in and
knowledge of CB2 conditions and needs, and respects their guidance with project principles for an area
that is safe + inviting, people centered + balanced, connected + seamless, rational + organized, high
quality + timeless, and coordinated + innovative; and
Whereas CB2 welcomes the many goals for improvement put forth in this broad overview, such as safety
at intersections and at West St. crossings for pedestrians and bicyclists, simplification and clarity in
defining directions and routes, rational and comfortable access for all, drop off, pick up and loading zones
where needed, greening snd other public space enhancements, and an equitable balance for all street uses
and modes, all of which can benefit the community; and
Whereas CB2 recognizes that this broad vision is the starting point for further detailed, defined and
separate presentations of each of the four remaining individual interim projects in CB2 for additional
input and refinement and of subsequent proposed capital improvements;
Therefore be it resolved that CB2 supports the MPD's continued work on its Western Gateway Study
and development of the individual projects within its purvey; and
Be it further resolved that CB2 looks forward to being apprised of continued Study progress and hosting
future project presentations.
Vote: 38 Board Members in favor
1 recusal (Donna Raftery).
2. Resolution in response to presentation of design concept for an enhanced King St. off Hudson St.
by Hines real estate.
Whereas, Hines/Hudson Square Properties, presented a design concept for proposed public space
improvements on King St. btw. Hudson and Greenwich Sts.; and
Whereas, with the goal of creating a vibrant and welcoming place where the community can gather, relax
and enjoy socializing, attending an event or just walking through, the Hines team has been working with
the NYC Dept. of Transportation (DOT) for over three years to address site constraints and comply with
requirements, and also consulting with the Hudson Square BID in order to incorporate elements that
correspond with the BID's improvements in the district while applying some others that highlight the
street's own identity; and
Whereas the design for the newly revitalized street includes:
• A new street tree, adding to the two already existing, along with several large, above grade tree
planters (working around existing vaults and utilities).
49• Extensive planting beds/gardens on both sides of the street.
• Sidewalk widenings bulbing out on the northeast, southeast and southwest sides, providing extra
space for greenery and shorter, safer crossings for pedestrians.
• 77 seats, including 36 in built-in timber benches with backrests, 10 in timber benches on planters
with backrest capacity, and 31 on granite platforms salvaged from construction and restored,
providing a historical reference to the past.
• Preservation of the existing Access-A-Ride facility with seating for four and a glass bus-type
shelter.
• Use of local artwork on walls for murals to offset the effect of loading docks; and
Whereas the street’s current condition reflects the district's former industrial nature, lacking enhancement
and now underutilized, presenting an opportunity to add amenities, activities, comfort and character to
better serve this upcoming commercial and residential community; and
Whereas maintenance will be performed in partnership with the Hudson Square BID; and
Whereas final project completion is anticipated for 2024; the bulk of the improvements, including
landscaping and roadside work, are expected to be done within a few months in 2023, providing quick
positive changes for the community, while the benches, which will go through revocable consent review,
are expected to be installed in 2024; and
Whereas considerable support was expressed for the project by neighborhood residents and
organizations, including the president of the Van Dam St. Block Association, who indicated that the
planners reached out to area residents on Van Dam and also on King and Charlton Sts., addressing and
satisfactorily answering all their concerns regarding traffic flow, sanitation and security, the Hudson
Square BID, Here Arts Center, the Children's Museum, and other local people;
Therefore be it resolved that Community Board 2 Manhattan (CB2) fully supports the proposed public
space improvements on King St. btw. Hudson and Greenwich Sts. and admires the Hines team's
perseverance in developing this scheme for improving community life and enhancement, working around
constraints and limitations in cooperation with the DOT; and
Be it further resolved that CB2 encourages DOT and all the other involved City agencies to faciitate all
efforts to ensure swift implementation of these welcome improvements.

CB#2 Resolution in Support of the Placement of all 3 Measures Proposed
by the Racial Justice Commission for the New York City Charter on the Ballot
Whereas, the NYC Racial Justice Commission was formed to examine the NYC Charter to identify
barriers to power, access, and opportunity for Black, Indigenous, Latinx, Asian, Pacific Islander, Middle
Eastern, and all People of Color in New York City and put forward ballot proposals aimed at removing
those barriers and advancing racial equity; and
Whereas, the commission held over 50 public engagement events and collected hundreds of hours of
testimony, and used that input to create a roadmap1 for the City to dismantle structural racism at all levels
of government.
Whereas, Proposal 1 adds a Statement of Values to Guide Government2 in the form of a preamble to the
New York City Charter that would allow New Yorkers to adopt a vision and statement of foundational
values intended to guide the City government in fulfilling its duties; and
Whereas, Proposal 2 establishes a Racial Equity Office, Plan, and Commission3 to amend the City
Charter to require citywide and agency-specific Racial Equity Plans every two years, establish an Office
of Racial Equity and appoint a Chief Equity Officer to advance racial equity, and create a Commission on
Racial Equity to bring community voices to the racial equity planning process; and
Whereas, Proposal 3: Measure the True Cost of Living4 amends the City Charter to require the City to
create a True Cost of Living measure to track the actual cost in New York City of meeting essential needs
without considering public, private, or informal assistance, in order to inform programmatic and policy
decisions; and
Whereas, the proposals are actions and steps toward solutions that reverse the ways communities become
oppressed, marginalized, and disempowered. They celebrate New York’s richness of diversity and invite
New Yorkers to have a voice in government, one which will prioritize decisions that matter across
communities that have the least access.

Vote: Unanimous, 42 Board Members in favor.
LAND USE AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
1. *813-815 Broadway (between East 11th and 12th Streets) - BSA Cal No. 197-05-BZ is an application
to the BSA to extend construction time of an 11-story, mixed-use building with ground floor commercial
space. Additionally, the applicant seeks modification of one of the conditions that the BSA attached to its
most recent extension of time for the project, which condition was no further extension of time. No
changes to the most-recently-approved plans are contemplated by this request.
Whereas:
1. On June 13, 2018, CB2 recommended approval of an application to further extend construction time by
two years and add a 2’x28’ bump-out at the back of the building. On Oct. 30, 2018, the BSA, after
expressing concern that no construction activities had commenced yet on the site, approved an extension
of FOUR years with a number of conditions, most notably that there be no further extensions of time
granted past April 29, 2022 to complete construction.
2. The BSA clearly declared in 2018 that the current extension would be the last one granted and that
work must be completed by April 29, 2022.
3. Whereas, the applicant claims ownership has faced further delays due to the Covid Pandemic.
4. Despite Covid restrictions for construction being lifted in June 2020, the applicant has not started any
construction activity nor filed building permits for this project to date, the reasoning that the Covid
pandemic delayed him seeming specious.
5. In addition, Village Preservation shared new testimony regarding the deep importance of said site to the
history of New York City and Greenwich Village and other recent developments that impact the
neighborhood.
6. This neighborhood has undergone significant development in the preceding 15 years.
Therefore, be it resolved that CB2 concurs with the 2018 BSA decision to deny any further extensions
of construction time for this project.
Vote: Passed, 41 Board Members in favor.
Opposed: 1 (R. Sanz)

9. *52 Greene St. – Application is to add 2 new stories on top plus a penthouse to a 3-story building,
install new windows throughout and extend the fire escape to the roof.
Whereas:
A. The existing three-story building was originally a five-story building that had its two upper stories
destroyed in a fire and the proposal is to rebuild the two upper stories according to a historic photograph
and to add a non-visible penthouse; and
B. The intact lower floors and the historic photographs provide ample evidence and example that the
facade can be restored to its original design; and
C. The applicant represented that every effort will be made to ensure that the brick, windows, and
detailing of the rebuilt stories will blend seamlessly with the lower floors and the appearance will be
convincingly as though the facade remained intact; and
D. The parapet and several courses of bricks that were added in making the building usable after the fire
will be removed and various color and textured bricks will be used to match the existing facade and the
original cornice will be reproduced following the historic drawing; and
E. The Committee discussed with the applicant in great detail the importance of the addition being an
imperceptible continuation of the existing facade and the applicant confirmed that this is the intention of
the design; and
F. Numerous sightline studies clearly illustrate that the dark grey aluminum penthouse and mechanical
equipment are sufficiently set back from the front facade to not be visible from the public thoroughfare
opposite the building and the taller buildings to either side of the subject building are sufficiently tall to
block views from the north and south; and
G. A fire hydrant in a bay with entry doors blocks one of the doors from being fully opened and it will be
moved to the bay without doors; and
H. The applicant represented that the restoration of the ground floor will be the subject of a separate
application and that ADA requirements for entrance will be addressed at this time; and
8I. The rear facade will be rebuilt following the design of the intact lower floors and the windows will be
replicated in kind; and
J. Zoning requirements changed since the original building was constructed require a setback of the 4th
floor rear facade which will now provide for a terrace; and
K. There were questions and comments from the public; and
L. The Board commends the applicants for proposing a faithful reproduction of the upper floors facade
and the care with detail that will make this an exceptional restoration; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends approval of the faithful historic recreation of the
facade of upper floors, the non-visible penthouse, and the restoration of the upper rear facade.
Vote: Passed, with 40 Board members in favor, and 1 abstention.
10. *738 Greenwich St. – Application is to reuse a 4-story parking garage as a multi-unit
residential building, restore the front facades, modify ground-floor infill, alter window openings
and configuration for 3 windows, remove a portion of the rear of the building to provide light and
air, add a one-story rooftop addition with required mechanicals and bulkheads, and excavate below
the building to expand the existing cellar.
A. The facade restoration includes removal of the white paint from the ground floor, replacement of
mismatched brick, altering the size of certain windows, and replacing the windows in kind; and
B. Balconies are to be build on the third floor with non-historical glass railings which introduce an
unwelcome detail completely without historical reference to the intact facade; and
C. A modestly visible setback one story penthouse respects the ceiling heights of the existing building
and the height of the existing bulkheads and has HVAC equipment on top; and
D. A long “dormer” window on the south roof is highly visible from the south and disturbs the neat line
that the penthouse reveals above the parapet; and
E. The parapet railing is extremely visible and its being set back some distance would minimize this
disturbance; and
F. The west bulkhead will be “squared off” with matching brick and the multipaned window in the style
of the windows on the lower floors is proposed to be replaced with an incongruous, non-historic plate
glass window; and
F. A portion of the northwest corner of the building, not visible from any public thoroughfare, will be
removed to prove light and air, necessary for residential use, and provide a rear garden, a welcome
addition to the small open space among the small rear gardens of the buildings behind; and
G. The south garage entrance is proposed to be converted to the residential entrance, the metal signs
removed, and the southwest service door is proposed both to have modern steel and glass infills and doors
and a steel and glass marquee which are disturbingly modern and without historical reference; and
9H. The north garage entrance will be converted to a residential entrance with a glass and steel infill and
the two new garage doors at the south, the metal signs will be removed, and service entrance are proposed
to be painted black which contrasts objectionably with the soft colors of the masonry; and
I. The existing painted signs in the sign bands are proposed to have the words “Parking” and “Garage”
artificially aged to give the appearance of ghost signs and. though the intention may be to take attention
away from the historic use of the building, tampers unnecessarily with the historic appearance of the
building and is clearly an artificial decorative alteration contrary to a number of extant examples in the
neighborhood including Northern Dispensary at Sherman Square and Gansevoort Stable (private home)
on 10th Street; and
J. The full cellar area will be excavated to various depths, all within the the perimeter wall of the
building;
K. There was public comment on the application; and
L. This is one of the finest adaptive industrial-to-residential reuse proposals that has been seen in the
West Village and, apart from certain details, it preserves the intact garage building as an example of a
vernacular 1930s industrial building; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:
Approval of this exceptionally fine application for adaptive reuse of a garage building to residential use
provided that the following modifications are made:
(Whereas items referenced are noted in lower case.)
A. (b) Change the jarringly modern glass balcony railings to iron, and
B. (d) Modify the “dormer” at the penthouse level in order that it is not visible, and
C. (f) Replicate the historic multi-pane window in the west bulkhead rather than replacing it with plate
glass; and
D. (g,h) Use multi-pane windows and doors in the ground floor entrance infills to preserve the historic
character of the facade; and
E. (h) Paint the garage and utility door in the west facade in a neutral color to blend with the facade; and
F. (i) Preserve the entire sign band text in its existing historical form; and
G. (j) Ensure that the excavation is carried out following all protocols and regulations to ensure that the
fabric of the building and neighboring buildings is not harmed.
Vote: Passed, with 40 Board members in favor, and 1 abstention (J. Osorio).
PARKS & WATERFRONT
A Resolution Regarding Active Recreation Uses at Seravalli Playground, Including Pickleball in
Unpermitted Spaces
10Whereas:
1. Our Committee held a public hearing at which attendees were encouraged to share their opinions
about the growing use of the paved open space at Corporal John A. Seravalli Playground, located
at Hudson St. between Gansevoort St. and Horatio St., by players of pickleball; and
2. Seravalli Playground was opened in the early 1960s, a tall fence surrounding the space was added
in 1986 to prevent stray balls from hurting pedestrians or damaging windows, and the playground
was renovated in 1992; and
3. Seravalli Playground is 1.14 acres in total, portions of which are a fenced-off basketball court, a
public bathroom building and a play equipment area, all on the eastern side of the space, with the
majority of the park left as open concrete (not covered with turf) space; and
4. The park is “unpermitted”, meaning usage is not reserved for specific organizations or purposes,
rather it is to be used on a first-come-first-served basis for active or passive unstructured
recreation; and
5. The NYC Department of Parks & Recreation (DPR) installed (painted lines), at some point in the
last year, two pickleball courts on the eastern edge of the pavement as a “test” of whether they
would be used and whether the sport could be safely integrated into the space and some
community members have expressed resentment that this was done without consultation with the
community; and
6. At our Committee meeting on October 17, 2022, many residents expressed their fondness for the
space and the importance of it as a place for children, especially younger children, to undertake
various play, exercise and recreational activities and, in the process, develop independence in a
protected area within sight of parents; and
7. Groups of organized sports leagues (e.g., Greenwich Village Little League, Downtown United
Soccer Club) shared signed petitions stating that they want this open play space to remain
unpermitted and dedicated to use by children, not adults; and
8. Many commenters shared their opinions that pickleball is a great sport for players of all ages, that
is quickly growing in popularity, and more space should be found in our City to enable and
encourage it, (e.g., roof of Pier 40, Hudson River Park, JJ Walker handball courts, open streets,
etc.); and
9. Most participants agree with the guiding principle that increased utilization of the limited open
space in our neighborhood is a desirable goal; however, the actions of pickleball players and
organized leagues who periodically and increasingly bring portable nets and set-up temporary
courts in Seravalli Playground thereby taking over the majority of the paved space was deemed
inappropriate by many who provided comments; and
10. Several attendees requested that rules about if, when and where pickleball players can play and,
more broadly, guidance on what activities are allowed in the playground, should be more clearly
defined and posted by the DPR.
Therefore, be it Resolved that CB 2, Manhattan:
1. Values our role of assisting in addressing community needs and concerns by acting as a conduit
and advocates for community residents to City agencies; and
2. Sees the Parks & Waterfront Committee meeting of October 17, 2022, as a successful, beneficial
step in a continuing process of finding solutions that will balance the objectives and goals of both
pickleball players who want space to play and residents who adamantly want to protect the open,
unpermitted space at Seravalli Playground from this use that they believe to be inappropriate and
potentially dangerous; and
3. Hopes to be included in the next steps of the process including presentation of proposals to the
community; and
114. Encourages the DPR to suggest viable options for more pickleball courts in the future while
concurrently reviewing and posting guidelines for use of Seravalli Playground, so understanding is
clearly communicated, and rules can be enforced when necessary.

Date) - Visit Savannah Tourism - Expect the Unexpected: Gansevoort Pedestrian Plaza
[Pedestrian Plaza]
Whereas, Visit Savannah Tourism, the destination marketing organization for the city of Savannah, GA,
wishes to stage an activation in the Gansevoort Plaza in order to promote tourism to the city of Savannah;
and
Whereas, the activation will include the service of Savannah-style cuisine, performances, artwork, and
social media engagement opportunities; and
Whereas, the proposed event is scheduled to take place on Saturday, November 12th, from 10 AM – 6
PM; and
Whereas, the event will be free and open to the public, with 200-400 attendees expected throughout the
day; and
Whereas, the majority of the setup for the event is expected to take place on Thursday, November 10th,
due to the Veterans’ Day holiday on November 11th, with breakdown expected to occur overnight on the
night of November 12th through the early morning hours of November 13th; and
Whereas, the activation will consist of a large 60’ x 60’ tent placed in the middle of the Gansevoort
Plaza, with the entrance to the tent facing towards the East side of the plaza, and a generator and dumpster
on the Northwest side of the tent; and
Whereas, the applicant stated that despite the tent being expected to take up the majority of the
Gansevoort Plaza, the applicant is planning to leave 5’ of clearance on all sides of the tent and to preserve
as much of the public seating in the plaza as possible; and
Whereas, the applicant has engaged private security to be present from event set-up through takedown;
and
Whereas, the tent will be heated through an HVAC system powered by the generator on the Northwest
side of the tent, with the applicant stating that they are seeking to use a “quiet” generator for this purpose;
and
12Whereas, CB2 QoL committee members and other CB2 board members present expressed the view that
the proposed activation had no real ties to the City or surrounding neighborhood, and is essentially
serving as an advertisement for the city of Savannah; and
Whereas, committee members and board members further expressed concern at the extended closure of
public plaza space resulting from the event, noting that the large size of the tent meant it was not likely
that much public seating would be preserved on the plaza, and that the proposed set-up schedule would
essentially close down the plaza during the Veterans’ Day holiday, when many members of the public
may have otherwise been utilizing the public plaza space; and
Whereas, further concern was expressed by committee and board members at the proposed take-down
schedule, which would likely create a noise disturbance for nearby neighbors throughout the night of
November 12th – November 13th; now
Therefore Be It Resolved that CB2 Manhattan recommends denial of Visit Savannah Tourism -
Expect the Unexpected.
Therefore Be It Further Resolved that should this event be approved by SAPO, CB2 Manhattan
recommends that action be taken to maximize public seating preserved on the plaza during the event, and
that an earlier ending time be considered for the event in order to allow take-down to be completed
earlier.

Whereas, global non-profit organization International Development Enterprises (“iDE”) seeks to host a
public restroom pop up event for “national toilet day,” in order to raise awareness of their organization
and on the lack of toilet access in parts of the developing world; and
Whereas, the pop-up will feature a standard mobile restroom trailer, approximately 25’ in length, with 10
stalls and handwashing stations, and will feature wrapped signage promoting the organization and its
mission; and
Whereas, the pop-up will be open to the public from 10 AM – 6 PM; and
Whereas, the pop-up will include security as well as a team to sanitize the restrooms throughout the day;
and
Whereas, the applicant stated that the pop-up is not expected to be ADA accessible, which drew serious
concern from members of the QoL committee, many of whom believed that the lack of ADA accessibility
contrasted with the organization’s mission of increased access; and
Whereas, in response to QoL committee questions on ADA accessibility, the applicant stated that cost
had been the deciding factor in choosing a trailer that was not ADA accessible, but that the applicant
would take another look at ADA accessible options; and
Whereas, members of the public expressed concern at the applicant’s initial intended location for the
trailer at 541 Broadway, stating that this location would be at an extremely high traffic area and in front of
a hydrant, in response to which the applicant stated they would be willing to move the trailer to 549-557
Broadway, in front of storefronts which are currently empty; now
Therefore Be It Resolved that CB2 Manhattan recommends approval of iDE Public Restroom Pop Up

2. Hiro Nishida d/b/a Sushidelic, 177 Lafayette St. 10013 (New RW–Restaurant) (previously
unlicensed)
i. Whereas, the Applicant and the Applicant’s Attorney appeared before CB2, Manhattan’s SLA
Licensing Committee #1 via video conference to present an application to the NYS Liquor Authority for a
new Restaurant Wine License to operate an elevated omakase and sushi restaurant on the ground floor of
a M1-5/R7X-zoned, six (6)-story commercial building (c. 1891, renovated 2011) on Lafayette Street
between Broome and Grand Streets (Block #472/Lot #28), the building falling within the SoHo-Cast Iron
Historic District Extension; and
ii. Whereas, the ground floor premises, located between the 7th and 4th building column directly to
the south of the building entrance, is approximately 2,700 sq. ft. (1,350 sq. ft. on the ground floor
connected by an interior, common stairway to 1,350 sq. ft. in the basement with no patron use of the
basement); there will be two (2) tables with 16 seats and one (1) bar with 27 seats for a total of 43 interior
seats; the premises has one (1) door which will serve as patron ingress and egress and two (2) bathrooms;
the store front infill being fixed without operable doors or windows that open out to the sidewalk, the
Applicant not presenting a certificate of occupancy or letter of no objection permitting eating and drinking
at the location; and
16iii. Whereas, the hours of operation will be from 11:30 AM to 2:00 AM Sundays through Saturdays
(7 days a week); there will be a sidewalk café with six (6) tables and 12 seats and roadbed seating in a
parking lane separated from the curb by a protected bike lane with 14 tables and 28 seats, both operating
under the temporary Open Restaurants program; music will be quiet background only consisting of music
from iPod/CDs; there will be no dancing, DJs, live music, promoted events, no scheduled performances or
cover fees, no velvet ropes, no movable barriers; and
iv. Whereas, the premises is a previously unlicensed location and was most recently (from
approximately 2011 to 2020) an unlicensed meeting and event space called the WeWork Lounge; and
v. Whereas, nearby residents appeared and had concerns about the late-night hours of the operation
particularly in a previously unlicensed location, those hours not being aligned with other nearby
restaurants, in addition to the proposed extensive seating and late-night hours of the outdoor dining,
concerns being the impacts on quality of life for the nearby residents, especially those in tenement
buildings across the street, that 40 persons dining outside until midnight each night would bring; and
vi. Whereas, further objections were raised regarding the 28 seats in the roadbed structure,
specifically that those 28 seats in the roadbed structure are across a traffic lane marked exclusively for a
NYC bike lane and are therefore not compliant with the clear definition of allowable “non-contiguous
municipal public space” defined in NYS Chapter 165 of 2022, that the roadbed seating is not “separated
from the licensed premises only by a pedestrian thoroughfare;” there being significant safety concerns in
allowing patrons and staff members to cross a busy bike lane to access the roadway structure, the
protected bike lane being newly created as a major bike connection to the Brooklyn Bridge and the newly
constructed exclusive bike lane crossing the bridge and points North in Manhattan; and
vii. Whereas, the temporary Open Restaurant Program was put in place during the Covid-19
pandemic to help operating restaurants through the period when there were limits on indoor dining, the
Applicant being new and not operating at the location during that time and therefore not having
previously incurred the expense of building roadbed structures at the location, there remains a lot of
uncertainty about what the siting criteria and guidelines for roadbed structures in particular will look like
for the permanent program, especially for those structures separated from the licensed premises by a bike
lane given the provisions of NYC Chapter 165 of 2022; and
viii. Whereas, after hearing the forementioned concerns from residents and the Committee the
Applicant showed no willingness to consider any reduction in hours on any day of the week, nor was the
Applicant willing to remove the roadbed structure from the instant application at this time; and
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that CB2, Man. recommends denial of the new Restaurant Wine
Liquor License application for Hiro Nishida d/b/a Sushidelic, 177 Lafayette St. 10013; and
THEREFORE BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that should this application be considered by the SLA,
CB2, Man. respectfully requests that this item be calendared to appear before the Full Board of the SLA;
and
THEREFORE, BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that, if despite CB2, Man.’s objections, should the
NYSLA not find good cause to deny this Application, CB2 Man. recommends that the Restaurant Wine
License granted for Hiro Nishida d/b/a Sushidelic, 177 Lafayette St. 10013 include stipulations of
closing hours of 12:00 AM Mondays through Sundays (7 days a week) on the interior and 11:00 PM
Mondays through Sundays (7 days a week) for the exterior sidewalk café and that the roadbed dining not
be permitted.

abstention (J. Osorio).

nd rd
(previously unlicensed)
i. Whereas, the Principal, General Managers/Operators and Applicant’s Attorney appeared before
CB2, Manhattan’s SLA Licensing Committee #1 via video conference to present an application to the
NYS Liquor Authority for a new Restaurant Wine License to operate a restaurant, deli goods alimentari
and caviar and champagne lounge on three floors of a M1-5/R7X-zoned, three (3)-story commercial
19building (c. 1830, altered 2013) on West Broadway between Broome and Grand Streets (Block #475/Lot
#10), the building falling within NYC LPC’s designated SoHo-Cast Iron Historic District; and
ii. Whereas, the full building has been undergoing a renovation to expand the previously ground
floor-only restaurant to the 2nd and 3rd floor, roof and rear yard; the interior premises is approximately
1,599 sq. ft. on the ground floor, 1,209 sq. ft. on the second floor and 670 sq. ft. on the third floor, the
renovation also consisting of the addition of an exterior rooftop area of approximately 609 sq. ft. on the
third floor; the interior premises being connected by two staircases, one in the front part of the premises
and another in the middle rear of the premises which also leads to the exterior third floor rooftop; and
iii. Whereas, the proposed method of operation varies between floors; the ground floor will function
as a full-service restaurant with weekly rotating guests chefs, there will be eight (8) tables with twenty
eight (28) seats, one (1) counter with three (3) seats and one (1) bar with eight (8) seats for a total of thirty
nine (39) seats on the ground floor; the 2nd floor will function as a deli goods alimentari as well as caviar
for tasting and/or purchase, there will be one banquet with three (3) tables and ten (10) seats and one
bar/island with eight (8) seats for a total of eighteen (18) seats on the 2nd floor; the 3rd floor will be an
intimate caviar, champagne and cocktail lounge, there will be two (2) tables with eight (8) seats, a large
banquet with five (5) tables and twelve (12) seats and one (1) bar with eight (8) seats for a total of twenty
eight (28) seats on the 3rd floor interior, the floor plans indicating an additional 28 seats on the exterior
rooftop; the provided questionnaire listing the total overall number of seats in the premises to be 136;
there are two (2) doorways serving as both patron ingress and egress, there is one (1) bathroom on each
floor for a total of three (3) bathrooms; there is a kitchen on both the ground and 2nd floors; and
iv. Whereas, the Applicant appeared before CB2, Man. in July/2021 for an On-Premises Restaurant
license at this location with the exact same method of operation as the instant application, after meeting
with a local block association (West Broadway Block Association), at that time the Applicant agreed that
there will be no open rooftop bar or use of the rooftop, there will be no live music and/or DJs, the hours of
operation will be from 12:00 PM to 12:00 AM Sundays through Saturdays (7 days a week) with last call
being at 11:00 PM Saturdays through Sundays (seven days a week), the Applicant continues to agree to
those terms albeit with a beer and wine license; and
v. Whereas, in 2018 the Applicant appeared before and was recommended for approval by CB2,
Man. (and subsequently the NYSLA) for a RW license (Badhair, LLC SN#1315500) at a separate
location at 43 MacDougal St. for a multi-floor establishment at another location and signed and executed
a detailed stipulation agreement which included agreeing to only have live acoustic piano on the
weekends in the basement venue with no drums, no brass, no electric guitars or bass instruments and no
scheduled performances, no events where a cover fee is charged and operating under a separate dba as
accessory to the primary ground floor establishment, yet the basement premises were in fact opened and
operated openly as a full Jazz Club and written up in publications such as the online local food media
Eater New York on June 11, 2019 in an article titled “Nightlife Hitmaker Ariel Arce Opens a Seductive
Retro Jazz Club in Soho” with a photo showing piano, trumpet, upright bass and drums and article stating
there will be two shows a night with a cover charge of $20; the premises own website currently shows
monthly calendars of jazz bands and also stating two shows a night Wednesday through Saturday with a
two drink minimum and using a similar photo; the elements regarding operation of live music in that
executed stipulation agreement being a critical element of CB2, Man.’s recommendation which allowed
the license to be approved by the NYSLA absent an appearance before the Full Board; and
vi. Whereas, both in July/2021 and this month, when presented with questions about operations at
the other location at 43 MacDougal St. including disregard of those explicit stipulations she agreed to
with her attorney present and which she memorialized in the executed agreement, the Applicant did not
deny operating a basement jazz club and simply stated there had been no complaints and did not offer
further explanation; and
vii. Whereas, the only difference for this application at 357 West Broadway between the July/2021
application and the instant application being the license class, the previous On-Premises license being
subject to the 500 foot rule requiring the Applicant to satisfy the public interest standard for adding
another licensed establishment in this area, the area being saturated with licensed establishments (40
active licensed establishments and 5 pending within 750'), there being real concerns raised about possible
20outdoor rooftop use despite any stipulations agreements that might be entered into based on the past
history of the Applicant blatantly disregarding stipulations agreements, the instant application now being
for at this location is for Restaurant Wine only and not carrying the same public interest burden, the
Applicant agreeing at this month’s CB2 Man.’s SLA committee meeting to return to CB2, Man. to
address the separate issues at 43 MacDougal St. regarding method of operations for Badhair, LLC; and
viii. Whereas, the Applicant has executed and has had notarized a Stipulations Agreement with CB2,
Man. that they agreed to submit to the NYSLA and agreed would be attached and incorporated into the
method of operation of the new Restaurant Wine License, with those stipulations as follows:
1. Premises will be advertised and operated as a seated pre-fixe dinner restaurant with weekly
rotating guest chefs on the first floor, a deli goods market as well as caviar for tasting and/or
purchase on the second floor and an intimate caviar and champagne lounge on the third floor.

nd
& 3 Flrs., unless the statements presented by the Applicant are accurate and complete and that the

ft. curb cut/No Standing Anytime; Proposed: Curb cut shortened by 19 ft. (some regrading
involved), No Standing Anytime preserved.
• 124 ft. zone to accommodate customer delivery vehicles (e.g. Instacart, Grubhub, Uber,
DoorDash) and delivery cart bicycle vehicles (from the 126 ft. curb cut east to Lafayette St.)
Existing: 105 ft. No Standing Mon-Fri 8am-6pm; Proposed: No Parking Anytime (Only to pick up
orders from store for delivery to customers). Separate dimensions for each of the two uses to be
decided.
N.E. corner E. 8th St. and Broadway - added CityRack (hoop) bike racks proposed to accommodate
shoppers coming by bicycle (and other bicyclists)
• Add four more CityRacks east of the six already existing CityRacks that are on the sidewalk next
to the subway entrance.
S.W. corner of Lafayette St. and Wanamaker Pl. (E. 9th St,) - Additional CityRack bike racks
• Three CityRacks proposed on the sidewalk near the s.w. corner.; and
Whereas 8th St. btw. Broadway and Lafayette St. is both a narrow and exceptionally busy thoroughfare
with heavy automotive, pedestrian and bicycle traffic, including considerable gridlock at morning rush
hours, 4-9 pm, and other peak times. A bicycle lane and the M8 bus route further constrict passage in the
roadbed, while the sidewalk is filled with NYU and Cooper Union students, patrons of local businesses
and restaurants along Broadway and on 8th St., people coming back and forth from the Astor Pl. and 8th
St. subway stations, and area residents and workers. With Wegmans arrival (and expected popularity),
this activity will increase; and
Whereas these traffic and parking conditions at this first truly urban Wegmans location (the Brooklyn
store has a parking lot and more of a suburban format) require consideration of the distinct challenges
they present, and, as such, call for advance study to determine how best to balance street and sidewalk
changes, including curb designation, and mitigate negative impacts. To date, no studies have been
executed; and
Whereas Community Board 2 Manhattan (CB2) seeks to avoid any increase in automotive traffic and its
dangerous impacts and appreciates Wegmans' plan to employ delivery cart bicycle vehicles and to add
CityRacks to accommodate shopping bicyclists. At the same time, CB2 is concerned about the effects of
e-delivery services' motor vehicles which, although they're expected to quickly pull in, pick up orders, and
pull out, will also add more automotive traffic and congestion to the street and danger for pedestrians and
bicyclists; and
Whereas CB2 also appreciates Wegmans' intention to transport goods to the 770 Broadway store in small
trucks as opposed to the tractor-trailer type trucks typically used for Wegmans suburban locations. It is
not clear whether these smaller trucks would also include other needed safety features, especially “Direct
Vision”/""High Vision"" cabs that allow truck drivers to see all around outside the truck to avoid collisions
resulting from commonly blocked visibility5; and
5 The use of peep and teardrop windows, sloped-hood cabs, cab-over engine designs, and high vision cabs can prevent a
common type of fatal pedestrian crash in urban settings where truck drivers cannot see pedestrians crossing in close proximity
to them. This is particularly hazardous to children, the elderly, and shorter adults. Long truck fronts, relatively small windows,
and obstructed vision from add-ons such as insect shields block visibility of vulnerable road users and increase hazard. In a
University of Leeds/Arup study commissioned by Transport for London, researchers concluded that truck drivers in low-entry
cabs, with direct sight of pedestrians and cyclists in front and to the side, are involved in 40% fewer collisions than drivers
operating traditional cabs. See https://nacto.org/program/vehicle-design/ and https://nacto.org/2018/12/06/nacto-volpe-
release-best-practices-for-redesigning-large-vehicles/
43Whereas it was indicated that most of Wegmans' deliveries occur overnight and in the very early
morning, to stock the store before it opens, although a definitive schedule for 770 Broadway has not been
finalized; and
Whereas CB2 fully welcomes additional bike racks, however, on Lafayette St. btw. E. 8th St. and
Wanamaker Pl (E. 9th St.) the sidewalk is often crowded with the many users of the CitiBike station there
and people on their way to many nearby destinations, e.g. Cooper Union, Astor Pl., the two subway
stations. NYU, shopping and dining. An alternative location to that proposed for a CityRack at the s.w.
corner of Lafayette St. and Wanamaker Pl. may be more fitting and even accommodate more bike racks;
and
Whereas the Village Alliance Business Improvement District includes the blocks encompassing E. 8th to
E. 9th Sts. btw. Broadway and Lafayette Sts., i.e. where Wegmans new store will be located. With
extensive knowledge of the area, the Alliance can be a rich source of information about it; and
Whereas Wegmans has expressed willingness to monitor conditions as this project progresses and to
report back to CB2 at intervals regarding implementation activities and outcomes as well as necessary
adjustments, emphasizing the company's long history of responsiveness to the public;
Therefore be it resolved that CB2 asks that Wegmans conduct a study of existing conditions primarily
on E. 8th St. btw. Broadway and Lafayette St., but also on Lafayette St. btw. E. 8th and E. 9th Sts.
(Wanamaker Pl.), including such factors as automotive, bicycle and pedestrian traffic counts and flow,
street and sidewalk widths and uses, and truck and delivery frequencies, to evaluate how to best fit
Wegman's anticipated activities with those occurring there now and provide a guide to establishing a
workable balance between them; and
Be it further resolved that CB2 prefers a pickup-for-delivery model that relies on delivery cart bicycle
vehicles and other cargo bikes rather than motor vehicles and asks that consideration be given to solely
employing cargo bike/delivery cart bicycle vehicles for this purpose; and
Be it further resolved that CB2 urges Wegmans to outfit its delivery trucks with ""Direct Vision""/""High
Vision"" cabs and other safety features as recommended by NACTO for safe vehicle design, as well as to
use electrically powered vehicles; and
Be it further resolved that CB2 encourages Wegmans to do off-hours deliveries, i.e. to continue its
practice of overnight deliveries at the new 770 Broadway store to avoid vehicular conflicts and noise that
might otherwise occur at more heavily trafficked times, especially in view of its location on a street with
purely commercial uses as opposed to mixed use streets in Community District 2 with concerns about
nighttime residential impacts; and
Be it further resolved that CB2 recommends that the three CityRack bike racks proposed for the
sidewalk at the s.w. corner on Lafayette St. at E. 9th St. (Wanamaker Pl.) instead be installed around the
corner on the s.w. side of E. 9th St. near the corner at Lafayette in the streetbed, which is wider than that
on E. 8th St., where pedestrian and automotive traffic is considerably lighter than on Lafayette St., and
where there's enough room to install at least an additional three bike racks, if not more; and
Be it further resolved CB2 advises Wegmans to consult with the Village Alliance Business
Improvement District for input on assessing conditions and needs in the project area; and
Be it finally resolved that CB2 looks forward to conferring with Wegmans about Wegmans' findings as it
monitors implementation of the project, and requests that Wegmans report back to CB2 four weeks after
44the store's opening with an update, including such items as delivery frequencies and times, modal split,
curbside use, traffic conflicts, service provider pickups (day of week, time and type of vehicle),
community feedback, and what modifications, as needed, have been applied, and present another update
to CB2 four months after that, while also agreeing to be available for a follow-up visit after that should
there still be issues needing remediation

3. *429 West Broadway – Application is to replace storefront doors and lock system.
Whereas:
A. The proposal is for a single entrance door painted to match the existing cast iron; and

building and the historic district, and other appropriate designs are readily available that would better
serve security the purpose in the historic district; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:
A. Approval of the entrance door; and
B. Denial of the security gates unless it is of a material and design in harmony with the building and the
historic district.
Vote: Unanimous, with 44 Board members in favor.

passersby: and
C. Two windows and the front door are to have medium size red logos: and
4D. The applicant gave contradictory testimony concerning the positioning of the adjustable mirrors and
whether they would be fixed or can pivot to reflect into the showroom or to reflect passersby on the
sidewalk; and
E. The use of the mirrors in this manner is out of keeping with the building and the neighborhood and
detracts and distracts from the historic character of the district; and
F. Red logos are to be attached to the door and two of the mirrors; and
G. The renderings show marked differences from the existing condition of the street level facade and the
applicant represented that there no changes apart from the mirrors and logos; now

building over and against the historic preservation of the façade; and
I. There was written and oral testimony from the public, principally tenants in the building, opposed to
the application as moving the residential entrance opposite the subway railing where there is less
sidewalk room for easy egress especially with respect to the disabled and will result in changes to the
interior residential staircase which will displace tenants; and
J. CB2, Man. has significant concerns that this proposal for reconfiguring the storefront facade, which
will result in changes to the interior building staircase, may result in displacement of long-time existing
rent regulated tenants through loopholes in the 2019 revisions to the rent stabilization laws with no
discussion thereof; and
K. CB2, Man. has strong concerns with tenant displacement, and this was a key area of concern for CB2
during the recent rezoning of SoHo and NoHo of which this building is a part and CB2, Man. has a long
history of opposing actions which result in displacement of rent regulated tenants.
Therefore be it resolved that CB, Man. recommends:
A. Denial of removal and relocation of the historic cast iron pilasters from their present, original
location, denial of the cornice lighting, and that the central entrance remain; and,

Whereas, the applicant has been working with NYPD, who has told them that the entire street should be
closed off for safety reasons, despite the applicant initially applying for a sidewalk and curb lane closure
only; and
Whereas, the event will feature amplified sound during the 15 minute show but will not be louder than
allowed decibel levels; and
Whereas, the show will be an invitation event but will be open for viewing by members of the
community and passers-by; and
13Whereas, no scenic elements will be added to the street other than speakers and barricades, which will
allow for a quick set-up and tear-down; now
Therefore Be It Resolved that CB2 Manhattan recommends approval of Nguyen Inc. – NYFW

applicable laws, rules, and regulations—including any and all COVID related orders and/or restrictions—
and clearance requirements.

[full street closure]
Whereas, the applicant did not appear on behalf of this application and the committee was
unable to hear the particulars of this event; and
Whereas, residents and community members expressed significant opposition to the event, noting that the
proposed event would seek to draw thousands of people into a predominantly residential area and would
cause significant disruption as well as being a drain on resources for the NYPD and other agencies; and
Whereas, any event of this scale would require significant, in-depth planning and coordination with
multiple agencies and community groups over the course of many months, none of which the committee
believed had taken place; now
Therefore Be It Resolved that CB2 Manhattan recommends denial of Let Us Worship.
Vote: Unanimous, with 44 Board Members in favor.

falling within the designated Greenwich Village Historic District; and

building, Fiddlesticks (SN# 1134074), since 2002 as well as another tavern in CB2, Man. (Carabean,
LLC d/b/a Downtown Galway Hooker SN# 1224977) since 2009, there being numerous 311
complaints regarding among other things loud music at both establishments over the years, the
Applicant stating they were approached by the landlord to rent this space, the instant application will
target an older crowd with high price points for specialty cocktails, the higher prices purportedly
dissuading patrons from getting drunk, along with a mature environment and a full kitchen, the
application including a menu that appeared roughly thrown together and lacking a cohesive theme,
19the Applicant additionally stating the premises would serve the local neighborhood and that IDs
would be checked to show patrons live in the Village, the Applicant is willing to consider earlier
closing times of 12AM Sundays through Wednesdays; and

adjacent leased and licensed business establishment in order to properly vent to the roof, the viability
of the instant application being dependent upon using the space in the adjacent licensed business and
the applicant stating that they would not allow a competitor to use that adjacent space, this raising
questions as to both the legality of sharing a venting system, the limitations of that venting system
being dependent on a separate lease for another business and whether the businesses would truly be
operating as separate and distinct establishments, there being no basement associated with the instant
application for food storage or prep or alcohol storage, the supplied diagram indicating all liquor
storage for the instant application being solely behind the bar; and
vii. Whereas, additional concerns were raised as to a pattern by the Applicant at their other two
licensed premises in CB2, Man., of disregard for the local community due to the numerous noise
complaints regarding music emanating from open doors and windows as well as not abiding by the
siting guidelines of the temporary Open Restaurants programs, there being tables and chairs on the
curbside of the sidewalk at both locations which impede pedestrian flow on the sidewalk and give the
feeling one is walking through the restaurant itself as they pass; and
viii. Whereas, this application being subject to the 500-foot rule requiring the Applicant to
demonstrate that the public interest and public convenience would be served by the granting of a
liquor license in this area and at this location, the immediate adjacent area being already saturated
with multiple liquor licenses and late night drinking establishments, with there being 51 active
licensed premises within 750 feet of the subject premises, in addition to 10 pending licenses, the
Applicant unwilling to consider instead a restaurant wine license at the location, the previous
business at this location closing at 9pm, there being an ongoing pattern of noise complaints at the
Applicants other licensed premises, the business model being dependent on a full liquor license to be
successful, there being significant objections raised in this application that cannot be resolved in a
reasonable manner;
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that CB2, Man. recommends denial of the application for a new
On-Premises Restaurant license in the name of DBNB, LLC d/b/a TBD, 58A Greenwich Ave. 10011;
and
THEREFORE, BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that should this application be considered by the

despite CB2, Manhattan’s recommendation to deny this application, CB2, Man. requests that the
NYSLA conduct a 500-foot hearing; and
THEREFORE, BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that if despite CB2, Man.’s objections to this
Application including the issues raised regarding the shared kitchen venting, should the NYSLA not find
good cause to deny this Application, CB2 Man. recommends in the alternative that the license granted
for DBNB, LLC d/b/a TBD, 58A Greenwich Ave. 10011 be a Restaurant Wine license with closing
hours of 12:00 AM nightly and background music only.

21. Lil Santino, Inc. d/b/a Daddie’s Pizza, 446-448-450 Hudson St. 10014 (New Restaurant
Wine– previously Unlicensed location)
i. Whereas, the Applicant appeared before CB2, Manhattan’s SLA Committee to present an
application to the NYS Liquor Authority for a new Restaurant Wine license to operate an Italian
family- style pizzeria restaurant by combining two commercial storefronts located within a six-story
residential apartment building (circa 1925) on Hudson Street between Morton and Barrow Streets, the
building falling within NYC LPC’s designated Greenwich Village Historic District; and,
ii. Whereas, neither storefront has ever been licensed for the service of alcohol, the first storefront
(450 Hudson Street) having previously operated for over a decade as a pizzeria, the pizzeria having
closed due to the Covid Pandemic; the second storefront being the King Deli (448 Hudson Street)
which served the local community for the last 30 years, the owners of the Deli remaining open
throughout the Pandemic but losing revenue and not being able to make their monthly rent on a timely
basis; and,
iii. Whereas, the Applicant recently renovated and opened his business, as of July/2022 within the
storefront at 450 Hudson while 448 Hudson remains vacant and not connected to 450 Hudson, the Deli
having been evicted and forced out of the space as of June/2022 due to an inability to pay its arrears of
rent; and,
iv. Whereas, the interior storefront at 450 Hudson is roughly 400 sq. ft. interior, there is a large
pizza oven and kitchen area, with 4 tables with 10 patron seats for a total interior seating capacity of 10
persons, 1 entrance/exit, 1 bathroom located in the rear requiring patrons to walk through the kitchen to
access it, the store front infill being fixed without operable doors or windows, with no certificate of
occupancy and/or letter of no objection being presented with the application permitting eating and
37drinking in either storefront sought to be licensed; and
v. Whereas, the vacant interior storefront at 448 Hudson is roughly 400 sq. ft. in size, has a
separate entrance/exit to the sidewalk, but is not connected on the interior storefront at 450 Hudson,
with a diagram presented showing that there will be 5 tables and 20 patron seats, and 1 bar with 4
additional seats for a total interior seating capacity for 24 persons; and,
vi. Whereas, the Applicant was not able to explain the additur to this application relating to the
address 446 Hudson Street, this address not relating to either of the two storefronts identified in this
application; and,
vii. Whereas, after opening, the Applicant has been operating with exterior seating on the public
sidewalk beyond the frontage of the operating storefront and on both sides of the sidewalk, and within a
large structure in the roadbed, the structure also being in excess of and beyond the frontage of the
operating storefront, with 18 tables and 36 patron seats on sidewalk and 10 tables with 22 patron seats
within the roadbed structure, for a total exterior seating for 58 persons, the Applicant further operating
with a large service bar/busing station located on the public sidewalk where waitstaff are stationed to
service its patrons on the sidewalk and roadbed; and,
viii. Whereas, the proposed hours of operation for the service of alcohol are Sunday to Wednesday
from 11:00 AM to 12:00 AM, Thursdays from 11:00 AM to 2:00 AM and Fridays and Saturdays from
11:00 AM to 4:00 AM, music in the interior will be background only; and,
ix. Whereas, there was opposition to this application, both in writing and in person, those in
opposition speaking to the Applicant’s refusal to meet with them, discuss any compromise on its hours
of operation, the over-saturation of liquor licensing in the immediate area, the Applicant’s bullying
tactics in forcing the proprietors of the King Deli out, and the proposed hours of operation until 4:00
AM being unreasonable and inconsistent with a family-friendly pizzeria restaurant, the Applicant
having provided a lease term sheet with the Landlord providing the Applicant with a “Covid
Abatement” while also seeking to terminate the existing lease with the Deli, the clear intent of the
Applicant and Landlord combined to remove the long-standing Deli business so that both Applicant and
Landlord would enjoy a financial benefit operating out of the contiguous storefronts, these bullying
tactics also being evidenced from the Applicants self-certifying request for roadbed seating for his
business as of January 14, 2022, despite there being no business operating out of the storefront at 450
Hudson for roughly six months, the Applicant immediately building the structure in front of the Deli in
January/2022, well beyond and more than double the dimensions of the storefront at 450 Hudson,
despite there being no immediate plan for the business to open or operate, the roadbed structure
remaining vacant and unused for those six months, the roadbed structure, when erected, also being non-
compliant with the NYC DOT rules or guidelines—resulting in five separate cease and desist orders
issued from the NYC DOT to the Applicant on January 25th, January 28th, March 17th, March 30th and
May 11th of 2022—with this Applicant never being subject to the Covid Pandemic; and
x. Whereas, the opposition also presented photographs showing that the Applicant’s current out
door dinging setup is non-compliant on the public sidewalk by operating with double the tables and
chairs that is currently stated and identified in its instant application, including tables and seats running
along the curb (identified by the NYC DOT as the “amenity zone”), tables and seats that go beyond and
38in excess of its business frontage at 450 Hudson, the photos showing the public sidewalk being
congested with tables and chairs, not providing the requisite 8' clear path for pedestrian traffic, the
service bar/station placed in the middle of the sidewalk surrounding by the restaurant’s staff further
exacerbating the congestion on the sidewalk; and,
xi. Whereas, when questioned about the non-compliance, the Applicant did not deny the non-
compliance with the NYC DOT’s Open Restaurant’s Siting Requirements
(https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pedestrians/openrestaurants.shtml ), repeatedly stating that he
would immediately resolve and remedy all of the non-compliant issues arising from roadbed structure
and over-congested public sidewalk; and,
xii. Whereas, despite the Applicant’s assurances in resolving the non-compliance, no changes to
either the roadbed or to sidewalk seating has occurred for the purpose of bringing his business into
compliance with the current temporary rules of the Open Restaurants program;
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that CB2, Man. recommends denial of the Restaurant Wine
License application for Lil Santino, Inc. d/b/a Daddie’s Pizza, 448-450 Hudson St. 10014; and
THEREFORE BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that should this application be considered by the

STANDING SEPTEMBER 2022 COMMITTEE REPORTS
LANDMARKS AND PUBLIC AESTHETICS
1ST LANDMARKS MEETING
1. *429 West Broadway – Application is to replace storefront doors and lock system.
47(withdrawn)
2. *396 Avenue of Americas - Application is to install interior and exterior illuminated signage, and
vinyl sheets on 3 windows on the W. 8th St. facade.
Whereas:
A. The building, located on a prominent corner in the central village, has undergone a number of
changes and had a lighted sign prior to designation; and
B. After designation, two signs of approximately the same size proposed were installed as evidenced by
ghost areas on the facades; and
C. In a prior approved design, never realized, lighted signs were approved on the two facades and a
lighted sign was approved over the corner entrance: and
D. The proposed signs are 20’6” X 6’4” with 23” high individual interior- lit white letters spanning 19’
and a 5’2” x 2’2” backlit sign at top of the corner bay above the entrance; and
E. The size, white color, and illumination of the facade signs is out of scale with the building and far
larger and more prominent than any in the district and gives the impression of a bright, double billboard
rather than simply identifying and promoting the business within; and
F. Light-colored vinyl sheeting is proposed to be installed on the exterior of three prominent windows on
the 8th street side to obstruct the view of interior fittings that were recently installed by the applicant
which now present an unfinished dry wall view to the street; and
G. The applicant installed the interior fittings in the showroom with complete disregard for ramifications
affecting the exterior appearance of the building and there results a self-created hardship that is proposed
to be solved with an aesthetically unacceptable and impractical solution; and
H. The vinyl sheeting has no relationship to the building and provides an inviting palette for graffiti,
which is increasingly problematic in the district, and the applicant presented no evidence concerning the
sheeting’s durability or its ability to be cleaned effectively; and
I. The overlarge illuminated signs and the light sheeting covering the windows detract from the building
and disturb the view of the prominent corner in the village that, though it does not contain the most
distinguished architecture in the district, has a collection of commercial establishments that respect the
scale and character of the area; and
J. There was testimony from the public (neighbors) opposing the application; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:
A. Denial of the two wall signs and recommends in their place letters at half the size of those on
temporary signs currently in place and shown in the presentation materials, in the blue signature color of
48the business as suggested by the applicant’s representative, and that they be fitted with lighting of a
sufficiently low level to make them clearly seen and not draw undue attention; and
B. Denial of the sign in the window over the doorway unless it has the same the same blue color with
same modest illumination as the wall signs; and
C. Denial of the vinyl sheeting applied to the windows, and that the applicant return for a public
hearing with a design that provides a view through the windows to preserve the architectural integrity of
the building.
Vote: Unanimous, with 44 Board members in favor.
3. *392-394 West. Broadway– Application is to paint the first story of the façade and to repair and
restore and illuminate the glass brick risers;
Whereas:
A. The building has unusually delicate design and detail with a historic unity of color values of white
that are intended to simulate stone in cast iron and is typical to the district and is in unusually pristine
condition apart from detailing at the ground floor; and
B. The existing color of the ground floor is of a white of deeper value with gold detailing typical to
the design; and
C. The proposal is to paint the ground floor a dark gray (Benjamin Moore Kendall Charcoal) and to
renew the gold trim; and
D. The glass block riser lights are to be restored and the illumination renewed; and
E. The applicant represented throughout the presentation that the present condition was as depicted in
the left picture marked “existing condition” on the sixth page of the application and that the purpose of the
hearing was to request approval to paint the ground floor of the facade the dark color as depicted in the
right “proposed” picture on the same page; and
F. Following the presentation, photo-substantiated testimony was presented by a member of the
Committee based on his recent visit to the building revealing that the actual existing present condition of
the building is in fact that which was represented in the picture marked as “proposed”; and
G. The applicant responded with implausible reasons for the fact that the proposed work had already
been carried out, including that the business was obliged to carry out the proposed work before it could
open for business, and gave no explanation of having spent considerable time in the deliberately deceptive
presentation; and
H. It is expected that presentation of materials and testimony in a public hearing or in any description
of an application by the applicant or the applicant’s representative in the public hearing before the
Landmarks Committee of the Community Board be accurate and truthful in every way in order for the
public to have an accurate understanding of the application in order to be able to comment and for the
49Committee and the Board to be able to make an accurate assessment in composing recommendations to
the Commission; and
I. There was testimony from the public opposing the application; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:
A. Denial of the approval of the actual existing dark color of the ground floor facade, which is not
historically appropriate for the building, diminishes its characteristic unity, destroys the harmony inherent
in the design, does harm to the historic character of the neighborhood and was carried out without
approval of the Commission and inaccurately presented by the applicant as a “proposed condition” when
it is the “existing condition”; and
B. That the ground floor facade be returned to a color of a slightly darker value of the existing white
of the upper floors; and
C. That the Commission take whatever punitive measures it is authorized to make concerning the
deceptive nature of the presentation in the public hearing and the carrying out of the extensive work
without approval; and
D. Approval of the restoration of the details in the facade to their original state and the restoration and
subdued lighting of the glass block stair risers.
Vote: Unanimous, with 44 Board members in favor.
4. *275 Canal Street - Application is to install illuminated signage on the facade and a blade sign.
Whereas:
A. The sign is a combination of three elements – a black band with white lettering, ‘KFC” in separate
red letters above and the company logo to the left; and
B. The total size of the three components is 8’8” wide and 42” high; and
C. The design of the sign and its scale together with illumination is what is presumed to be the
standard for the company however has in no way been modified to fit harmoniously into the intact historic
design of the building nor to show sensitivity with the historic district; and
D. The installation of elements of the double cornice-like frame obstructs historic elements and
detracts from the historic character of the building; and
E. A bracket sign is 2’high X 18” was represented as conforming to regulations for blade signs in the
district; and
50F. The applicant represented that it is intended to remove the temporary interior signs when exterior
signs are installed, though they conform to landmarks regulations in being 18” or more from the window;
and
G. There was testimony from the public opposing the application; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:
A. Denial of the facade sign, and that the applicant return for a public hearing before the Community
Board with a design that respects the character of the historic district and the landmark district; and
B. Denial of the unusually large blade sign unless Commission staff verify that the sign and its
positioning conform to the regulations for bade signs in the district.
Vote: Unanimous, with 44 Board members in favor.
5. *43 Barrow Street – Application is to restore the front façade, excavate the cellar and add a
penthouse on the roof and extend the chimneys.
Whereas:
A. The block is among the best preserved in the Village with small scale early row houses without an
any significant alterations and is a block, unusual for the village, without commercial establishments; and
B. The facade and iron work are to be restored and the windows changed from the existing one over
one to six over six which is typical for the period; and
C. The rear window on the ground floor is to be a large multi-pane window with a door to the garden
and the upper floors are to have six over six windows; and
D. The rooftop structure 21’ wide 12’ deep and 10’5” high, clad in zinc panels, has very considerable
and highly intrusive visibility from 7th Avenue South and within the block of small-scale buildings and
the extended chimneys are objectionably visible from a number of vantage
points; and
E. The angle of the street with respect to the avenue and the low buildings on the avenue make it
impossible to build this or any other structure on the roof that could possibly meet the standard for rooftop
additions to a row house in the Village as “not more than minimally visible from any public
thoroughfare”; and
F. The roof safety railing is rather heavy and is sure to be visible; and
G. A complete excavation of the entire cellar - wall to wall, front to back - with underpinning of the
end walls, especially the side party walls of the adjacent houses, is of great concern and considerable,
detailed accounts from neighbors who had undertaken excavation work detailed the dangers and in one
case abandoning the excavation; and
51H. There was further testimony from the public against disturbing the historic unity and harmony of
the block with the proposed or any rooftop additions and considerable opposition with alarm, shared by
the Board, concerning a proposal for a fire pit on the roof and though not visible are of enormous concern
in a frame building surrounded by other frame buildings; and
I. The very limited site with almost no yards would disturb all adjacent properties during
construction, even if proven to be feasible with detailed engineering documents; now
Therefore be it resolved the CB2, Man. recommends:
A. Approval with commendation of the restoration of the facade and installation of proper windows
of the period; and
B. Denial of the rooftop extension and chimney extensions or any other structure on the roof where
any construction would be unacceptably highly visible from the pristine street of small row houses and
the nearby avenue; and
C. Denial of the wall-to-wall excavation of the cellar for reasons of concern for the integrity of the
building and neighboring buildings; and
D. Denial of the rooftop fire pit owing to grave concerns over the evident danger of any open flame
in an enclave of wooden buildings and suggest communication with the proper authorities about this
aspect of the application.
Vote: Unanimous, with 44 Board members in favor.
6. 95 Bedford Street - Application is to restore the front façade, alter existing window and openings
at the side and rear, and construct a new rooftop addition
Whereas:
A. This historic Queen Anne style 4 story stable is situated beside the garden of a corner property on
a remarkably unchanged block, and has an unusual degree of visibility on a secondary façade; and
B. The application seeks to continue what was described as an evolution of adaptive reuse starting in
1904; and
C. The changes to the front façade are restorative, with new in-kind energy efficient windows, a
pedestrian entrance to be replicated in kind, carriage doors restored, and restoration of historic signage to
resemble the 1956 designation photo; and
D. The proposed alterations to the visible secondary façade (north elevation) include a partial raised
parapet, new windows to match historic type, a relocated opening on the ground floor, a relocated arch on
the second floor extending to the third, and a greatly increased opening for an expanded light well on the
52fourth floor which will create more visibility of the rooftop addition than the mock-up can possibly reveal,
as it is partially obscured by existing material that is proposed to be removed; and
E. The changes to the rear façade include new windows to match historic type, and the removal of
historic fabric to accommodate a continuous row of out of scale new “studio “windows on the fourth floor
that resemble a curtain wall more than the atelier windows of the district and introduces a modern element
into the especially well-preserved historic Grove Court; and
F. The proposed rooftop addition is not in harmony with either the district or its own building, but is
largely not visible from a public thoroughfare, with the exception that parts of the addition will be visible
from Bedford Street as well as Hudson Street; and
G. There was a lack of clarity from the applicant regarding the potential need for a variance for the
northern lot line windows, and the Committee is opining with the presumption of legality, but has
concerns about the appropriate sequencing here and is relying on the Commission to verify legality; and
H. A member of the public who resides in an adjacent building testified that the rooftop addition will
obstruct her lot line windows and render her apartment uninhabitable, which, while not a Landmarks
issue, is nonetheless disturbing in the context of a proposal that seeks to expand the applicant’s light and
air, principally by increasing openings in its own north lot line façade; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:
A. Approval of all proposed work on the front façade including new windows, new and restored
doors, signage restoration, and repair and restoration of the base; and
B. Approval of north façade window replacement and relocation of openings on ground and second
floors provided that they are either of right or proper permission is secured from the appropriate
authorities; and
C. Approval of expanded fourth floor opening and planter on north façade provided that the rooftop
addition is modified so that large expanses of curtain wall and ceiling glass are not visible from Bedford
Street; and
D. Approval of proposed changes to ground, second, and third floor windows on the rear façade; and
Denial of new fourth floor studio window on the rear façade since it is visible from Hudson Street and is
not harmonious with the building, resembling a glass curtain wall more than the characteristic atelier
windows of the district.
Vote: Unanimous, with 44 Board members in favor.
7. 263 West 11th Street - Application is to excavate part of the rear yard to construct a pool
Whereas:
53A. The applicant, whose rear yard lies within a remarkably intact classic Greenwich Village donut,
seeks to excavate a considerable portion of their rear yard in order to construct a 10’ X 26’ swimming
pool; and
B. The construction of an outdoor swimming pool in the context of the rear yards of Greenwich
Village is essentially an experimental process as this type of construction, while common in the suburbs,
is far beyond the norms of backyard amenities in the Greenwich Village Historic District, so it is not
demonstrable that the excavation and construction process for a pool will be without negative impact to
neighboring historic properties; and
C. An owner of a neighboring property testified that they had terminated an approved excavation on
their own property when they discovered that the ground was sandier and less stable than expected,
perhaps due to a former stream bed; and
D. The traditional concept of the donut implies a peaceful green oasis to be enjoyed by all the
residents on it; and
E. Many neighboring members of the public testified in objection to the proposal, and expressed
concerns including the potential for damage to their own historic properties from the excavation and
construction process, and inherent risks of the introduction of thousands of gallons of water into the
donut. Though not a Landmarks issue, they also expressed many significant quality of life concerns; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:
A. Denial of the excavation due to potential risk to neighboring historic properties in the course a
construction process that is uncharted within a similar context. The recommendation to deny this
application is also based on aesthetic concerns having to do with the historic significance of the backyard
donut in Greenwich Village and the continued importance of green space within the district.
Vote: Passed, with 43 Board members in favor, and 1 abstention (J. Liff).
8. 202-204 6th Ave. - Application is to install a retractable rollacover in the rear yard, wall between
the two buildings, exterior signage, and lights.
Whereas:
A. The proposed glass roof with 2 retractable sections serves to create an interior space that is
inherently unlike the garden examples that were presented as comparable precedents within the district;
and
B. The proposed wall on Prince Street, sandwiched between white brick buildings, is designed to
have, on CMU brick, a decorative finish of “rammed earth”, a material that has no precedent on the
exteriors of the district; and
C. The top of the wall is designed to be asymmetrical and is unsympathetic to the district in general
and to its streetscape in particular; and
54D. Aside from its visual incongruity, “rammed earth” has not been tested for graffiti- proofing; and
E. Insufficient information was provided for the Proposed Tenant Signage for the new “infill wall”
along Prince Street; the applicant included no details or diagrams for the size or materials of that signage,
and contradictory images for that wall signage, one showing simply “PLANTA” while others showed
“PLANTA COCINA” were presented, when asked about the size, the applicant could only offer estimated
sizes of the overall signage and the individual lettering; and
F. Insufficient information was provided regarding the blade sign, and contradictory information was
presented regarding the words proposed to be on the front wall; and
G. The enclosure of the space created by the glass roof creates a potentially dangerous fire egress
situation for tenants in a neighboring building, whose fire escapes appear to lead right into the restaurant;
and
H. Many neighborhood residents spoke out in vigorous objection, all sharing similar concerns
regarding the proposal’s disregard for the visual vocabulary of the historic district, with one person aptly
comparing the look of the wall to “a shopping mall in Scottsdale”. Other public concerns, though not
Landmarks issues, included noise and the aforementioned fire escape issue; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:
A. Denial of the rollacover, which serves to create an unambiguously interior space that is
fundamentally unlike the garden comparisons shown as precedent and;
B. Denial of the design of the street wall which is noncontextually within the historic district; and
C. Denial of the blade sign due to insufficient information; and
D. Denial of the sign on the “infill wall” along Prince due to insufficient information.
Vote: Unanimous, with 44 Board members in favor.

Whereas:
A. The plate glass, replacing windows with mullions, is out of character with the building and the

view, however it must be reviewed to ensure that the angle and slope comply with regulations; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:
A. Approval of the change in design and configuration of the windows; and
B. Approval of the changes in the entrance to provide ADA access provided that it conforms to

generally intact condition; and
B. The trellis (wooden screen wall) is visible, though not objectionable, and shortening the elevator
bulkhead by 12” was agreed by the applicant; and
C. The changes at ground floor and basement, in particular the sensitive design of the ADA compliant

Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:
A. Approval of the rooftop alterations and additions provide that the elevator enclosure be made 12”
lower as agreed by the applicant; and
B. Approval of the ground floor and basement changes and the unobtrusive ADA elevator storage.

Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:
4A. Approval of the front facade restoration; and
B. Denial of the highly visible rooftop additions; and
C. Denial of the rear facade restoration and further recommends that it preserve the historical design of

Whereas:
A. The front facade egress door is without detail to harmonize with the facade, the second-floor
windows are not suitable, and there is a lack of details at the main entrance; and
B. A marquee is proposed and, though not in the style of the building serves a useful purpose for the

SECOND LANDMARKS MEETING
7. 105, 107 Bank St.- Application is to connect the two buildings internally; restore the façade,
repair the masonry, and areaway alterations at 105 Bank; install new windows at the secondary,
east façade of 105 Bank; at both rear yards, remove the existing extensions, construct new rear
yard extensions at both buildings, and an expansion of the existing (eastern) bulkhead.
Whereas:
A. A prior application for 107 Bank Street has been heard and subsequently 105 was added to the
project to be combined into one building; and
B. Number 105 has been considerably altered and much of the original detail and the stoop are missing
and a historic photograph illustrates that 105 was built more simply than 107, though they are originally
a part of one five-house row; and
6C. The rear additions to both buildings will be removed; and new additions are proposed; and
D. The proposed alterations to 105 remove the stucco, retain a basement entrance in a different location,
reconfigure the top floor windows to their original small size and add a cornice; and
E. The 107-basement entry will be retained and the doors will be replaced with ones more suitable to
the building; and
F. The 107 entry will be restored to historic condition and
G. The proposal preserves the appearance of two separate houses that, though similar, are not matching;
and
H. The side elevation of 105, giving onto an alley, will have stucco removed and 6 lot line windows
installed and the brick parapet height from the front will be continued down the side; and
I. The rooftop addition to 105 is highly visible and considerably exceeds the standard of visibility for
rooftop additions to row houses in the district; and
J. The new rear facades of modest depth are clad in brick and grey metal or copper and brick and large,
multi-pane windows with plate glass central sections on the lower three floors and traditional windows
on the two upper stories; and
K. The extension for 105 is the full height of the building and fails to respect the principle of the top
floor rear wall being in its original plane; and
L. There are balconies variously on the parlor, second and third floors; and
M. The plate glass central portion of windows on the basement and parlor floors are without historic
reference and unsuitable to the house; and
N. Members of the public spoke against the visibility of the 105 penthouse and expressed concern that
care be taken with excavation and the cobblestone street during construction; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:
A. Approval of the front facade restoration that commendably preserves the separation of the facades
as two distinct houses; and
B. Approval of the lot line windows and the addition of a parapet on the east side; and
C. Denial of the penthouse on 105 as objectionably visible from public thoroughfares; and
D. Denial of the rear addition to 105 unless it is reduced by one story and that the top story back wall
preserve the line of the original back wall; and
E. Denial of the rear addition to 107 unless the windows on the basement and parlor floors are of a
design more suitable to the building.
7Vote: Passed, with 39 Board members in favor and 3 abstentions (N. Avanessians, S. Fitzgerald, C.
Wu).
8. 65 Spring St. – Application is to construct a 1-story rear yard addition, reconfigure fire escapes
and egress route, and install guard rails and privacy screens on the roof of the addition; and
Whereas.
A. At a prior hearing the application was incomplete - most notably in the absence of a mockup of the
proposed extension and the fences on its roof; and
B. The second application for this hearing also lacked a mockup despite the fact that the applicant was
notified that this was expected to be sent before the hearing; and
C. The application before us still has no mockup and the extension, without the rooftop screens, is
depicted in a drawing that is deceptively labeled as a mockup; and
D. This drawing purports to show visibility of the extension and screens, but shows no screens and the
applicant, after pointed questioning, conceded that there would be visibility of the screens from this
vantage point; and
E. This photograph is taken from the gutter on the near side of Lafayette Street and the applicant
neglected to provide a photograph from the far side of the street, from where there would clearly be
considerable visibility; and
F. In this, and other instances, the applicant was elusive and misleading in his responses to questions,
and questions had to be asked repeatedly in order to elicit an accurate response.
G. In the exchange concerning visibility and in other instances the applicant was elusive and gave
inaccurate answers to questions posed; and
H. Unusually for a landmarks hearing, there was discussion of the egress in order to ensure that a
proposal that could not be built on account of building and fire regulations was being considered; and
I. The applicant represented that the extension, the configuration of the fire escapes and egress routs and
the screens had been approved by the Department of Buildings but presented no verification for this
assertion; and
J. The proposal for the addition, completely filling the back yard is one story above grade with railings
and solid black privacy screens on the roof and is clearly visible from a public thoroughfare (Lafayette
Street).
K. There was testimony from the public objecting to the visibility and assorted matters not related to the
landmarks application; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:
8A. Denial owing to a second incomplete application: to wit the absence of a routinely required mockup
of proposed construction in order to make it possible to make a completely accurate appraisal of the
visibility of the proposed construction; and
B. Be it further resolved, denial is recommended based on the photographs and drawings provided in
lieu of a mock-up which show that there is considerable, undesirable visibility of both the extension and
the solid black privacy screens from a public thoroughfare.
Vote: Passed, with 39 Board members in favor and 3 abstentions (N. Avanessians, S. Fitzgerald, C.
Wu).

without Alternate Side Parking (“ASP”) within Community District 2 (“CD2”) are not receiving regular
street cleaning such as that which is received by streets subject to ASP; and

started immediately on all streets, not just those with ASP signs; and

not appear to receive regular (or any) cleaning, and
Whereas, the majority of non-ASP streets within CD2 are located in heavily touristed areas, such as
Soho, which see a significant amount of trash on the streets; now

streets within CD2, regardless of Alternate Side Parking (“ASP”) status, and submit such schedule to
CB2 for review and input.

TRAFFIC AND TRANSPORTATION
Resolution in response to presentation by the Meatpacking BID of the first phase of the BID's long-
term study of the western area of the Meatpacking District.
Whereas the Meatpacking BID presented the first phase of the BID's ongoing study of the western
area of the Meatpacking District (MPD), including findings and preliminary ideas for streetscape
treatments, traffic operations, and management, with an emphasis on safety for pedestrians and
bicyclists and improvement of the public realm; and
Whereas the goal of the presentation was to receive feedback from the Community Board 2
Manhattan (CB2) community regarding existing conditions and concerns, the MPD BID's preliminary
proposals, and suggestions for additional and/or alternative improvements and further opportunities;
and
Whereas the BID's study area in CB2 is bounded on the north by 14th St., on the east by Washington
St. with an extension on 14th to 9th Ave., on the south by Horatio St. to 10th Ave. and Jane St. from
10th Ave. to West St. and the Hudson River Greenway, and on the west by The Hudson River
Greenway; and
Whereas the study has focused on five different areas in CB2 (and a sixth in CB4 not addressed
here) with both their challenges and opportunities, including:
• 14th St. and 10th Ave. Interchange - Increasing pedestrian traffic is occurring, conflicting
with high vehicular traffic. Motor vehicles (including large, long trucks) have to weave across
six lanes to access West St. (Route 9A), while four separate pedestrian crosswalks need to be
simplified accessing Little Island as well as a lengthy crossing on separate signal phases
toward Chelsea Park. A frequent illegal right turn on red on 10th Ave. must be addressed, as
does illegal contra-flow traffic.
• 10th Ave./Meatpacking Cooperative (W. 13th and Little W. 12th Sts.) - There's no westward
bike access across W. 13th St. (across the district), but there's a new Route 9A crossing from
W. 13th, installed by NYSDOT in 2021, that improves riverfront access. A wide unmarked
roadway behind the Meatpacking Coop. (btw. Little W. 12th and Gansevoort Sts.) creates
pedestrian and truck conflicts and could accommodate more pedestrian use. A NYS-owned
parking lot btw. Little W. 12th and 13th Sts. toward 10th Ave. has public space potential, and it
was also pointed out that there's a potential to extend pedestrianization west on Little W. 12th
and on W. 13th. Better delivery and waste management are needed.
• Gansevoort Street End - A wide unmarked roadway on 10th Ave. btw. Gansevoort and Horatio
Sts. is used for late-night car races, endangering public safety, and offers the potential for a
plaza space. A crosswalk is needed on Gansevoort St. over 10th Ave., also West St., to access
the Hudson River Park, with additional crossings to accommodate access to the upcoming
Gansevoort Peninsula Park; the BID wants to work with NYSDOT and NYCDOT to achieve
this. With the huge volume of pedestrian traffic on Gansevoort, extending the open street west
44to include the Whitney Museum block is also a possibility.
• Washington St. - Deliveries, FHVs and off-hour parking conflict with walkers. The
Meatpacking Coop needs courtyard access from Washington. There are no marked east-west
pedestrian crossings at Little W. 12th St. (which are needed), and trucks circle the block for 9A
access. There's an opportunity to extend open streets further west on W. 13th St. over
Washington. Introducing cobblestones (Belgian block) on Washington where it's bare, in
keeping with the material texture of the district, is being considered.
• 14th St, Gateway - W. 14th St. from 9th Ave. west toward the Highline is wider than needed
based on traffic volumes, making it unwelcoming to pedestrians as well as encouraging to
double park. Consideration is being given to expanding pedestrian space, adding a median and
pedestrian amenities with one lane of traffic going each way (all that's needed there). The lack
of durability of the new cobblestone crosswalk pavers at Washington will have to be addressed.;
and
Whereas the presentation to CB2 was part of the BID's Engagement process, which the BID
indicated will also include outreach to all major property owners, key businesses, non-profit and
other cultural institutions, and the Jane St. Block Association (adjoining the BID area). Next, a
Public Realm Framework will be developed, including best practices, design context and toolkit,
followed by establishment of objectives and a strategic plan, programmatic pilots, and a final design
brief (in the Fall);
Therefore be it resolved that CB2 thanks the MPD BID for presenting the first phase of the BID's
ongoing study of the western area of the MPD and inviting input from the CB2 community on issues
and opportunities, community priorities, preferred focus of efforts, ideas for improvement, local
insights and knowledge, community engagement, and additional information that may have been
overlooked; and
Be it further resolved that CB2 appreciates the visual and verbal clarity of the presentation and
its rational organization, as well as its emphasis on pedestrian and bicyclists’ comfort and safety
and bettering community quality of life, all of which were well received; and
Be it further resolved that CB2 welcomes the MPD BID's efforts to reach out to the community
and supports additional efforts to residents, visitors, area businesses, non-profit institutions, Hudson
River Park users, schools and other community groups, perhaps through group meetings, interviews,
questionnaires, or intercept surveys; and
Be it further resolved that CB2 reiterates the issues and concerns voiced at the meeting at the
BID's invitation, including:
• Noise mitigation is needed from dirt bikes, speeding cars, and joy riders, especially
after midnight.
• There's a huge flow of people driving in from outside the city who won't use
public transportation. Where would they park?
• An incredible amount of garbage with overflowing trash bins needs to be addressed.
• Composting bins are needed.
• Traffic flow up Greenwich St. with a bottleneck at Horatio and Gansevoort Sts. needs
attention. Appropriate Stop signs and other signage + signals are needed on Greenwich and
Washington Sts.
45• Many hired vehicles congregate at the Jane St. Hotel, creating congestion there.
• Black cars are a great problem. They need some quick access to West St. and out of
the neighborhood besides only from 14th St.
• There will be more and more bikes. The 9A crossings need space to accommodate them.
• Bikes, e-bikes and scooters on the sidewalks continue to be a problem, blocking and
endangering pedestrians.
Be it further resolved that CB2 recaps the following recommendations for added
improvement suggested at the meeting in response to the BID's request for input, including:
• Address curbside use opportunities.
• Address the need for improved, clearer signage, including at open streets (e.g., Gansevoort
btw. 9th Ave. and Washington St.), and for additional signage at certain locales.
• Look at the possibility of installing neckdowns at particularly dangerous and difficult to
cross Washington St. locations.
• In addition to the new Route 9A crossing at W. 13th St., and those recommended at
Gansevoort St. and the access to the new Gansevoort Peninsula Park, consideration must be
given to installing crosswalks at other locations on Route 9A (West St.). With heavily
increased and steadily more increasing use of Hudson River Park and vicinity, the more West
St. crossings the better.
• Allow enough crossing time in West St. signalization for those who can cross no more than 3
ft. (no more than 2 ft. in some cases) per second. (NYCDOT has indicated it's possible to do a
minimum 40 second crossing time and still coordinate with other West St. signals).
• Widen crosswalks at West St. to accommodate increasing pedestrian and bicycle use. In areas
of heavy bike use, consider separate bike crosswalks (as done in Paris).
• Consider using speed tables at West St. crosswalks.
• Investigate Citi Bike infill station options on the east side of West St., extending east to
the origin of 10th Avenue, from W. 12th St. to Little West 12th St.
• The Jane-Horatio St. loop is favored because it channels traffic out.
• Consider taking a lane away from West St. for bicycle use and/or added pedestrian space.
• Work with the NYPD to ensure enforcement of traffic rules.
• Guidelines need to be established to limit noise and preserve safety during the project's
construction (such as for hours of operation), and signage is needed that alerts users to
changes in traffic patterns and directions.; and
Be it further resolved that CB2 is encouraged to learn that the MPD BID will seek to work with
NYCDOT and NYSDOT to implement the final plan, including short- and long-term improvements; and
Be it further resolved that CB2 urges both NYCDOT and NYSDOT to work with the MPD BID
and confer with CB2 in ensuring implementation of the final desired recommendations; and
Be it finally resolved that CB2 looks forward to further development of the MPD plan and updates
on each of the upcoming phases.
Vote: Passed, with 40 Board Members in favor.

STANDING COMMITTEE REPORTS
JOINT: ARTS & INSTITUTIONS & EQUITY, RACE & JUSTICE
Resolution in Support of Naming an NYU Theater at 181 Mercer
in Honor of The African Grove Theatre
1. Whereas, in 1821, at the intersection of Mercer and Bleecker streets, a retired West Indian
steward named William Brown founded the African Grove Theatre, the first known Black theater
in the United States; and
32. Whereas, the African Grove began in 1818 in the backyard of the William Brown's house on
Thomas Street as a Black-owned ""pleasure garden"" or ""pleasure ground"" at a time when public
open space was scarce, and pleasure gardens were reserved for white people only1 2 3 ; and
3. Whereas, the African Grove Theatre opened six years before the abolition of slavery in New York
State, and almost forty years before the start of the Civil War; and
4. Whereas, the 300 seat theater was built of wood and its auditorium consisted of a pit below stage
level, tiered house seating not partitioned into boxes so as to enhance the flow of air, and a gallery
whose ceiling was too low to permit hats and bonnets to be worn by spectators; and
5. Whereas, the first performance staged by the African Company, possibly the first professional
African American theater production ever, was a Shakespeare play; “After several nightly
caucuses, they resolved to set up a play, and the upper apartments of the neglected African Grove
were pitched upon for the purpose. Richard the Third, after mature deliberation, was agreed
on…4”; and
6. Whereas, the most popular plays were Richard III and Othello. James Hewlett was the first black
man of record to play the leading role in Othello; and
7. Whereas, the performances of the African Grove Theatre company were a hit and were so popular
that William Brown moved out of the little room on Thomas Street, where they’d been
performing, and 11 blocks north5, and rented out the bar next door to an established theater, the
Park at the intersection of Mercer and Bleecker streets6; and
8. Whereas, the owner of the Park was not happy about the competition and, because he was well
connected, when he called the police to complain about the noise next door causing all the actors
to be hauled off to prison and put in prison overnight7; and
9. Whereas, the African Grove Theatre actors were released from jail on one condition, they had to
promise never to perform Shakespeare again8; and
10. Whereas, in addition to Shakespeare, the African Company performed original plays and skits
that dealt with slavery and the plight of Native Americans, which included William A. Brown's
now-lost play, The Drama of King Shotaway about a 1795 Caribbean revolt against British Navy
forces on the island of Saint Vincent. Also produced by the African Company in 1823, Drama is
believed to have been the first full-length play by a black American performed in the United
States, and a ballet which featured Native Americans as dignified characters; and
11. Whereas, in 1823, The African Grove Theatre was ransacked by a white mob which, aided by
police, was responsible for the theater’s closure; and
12. Whereas, Transformation! An exhibition that looks at 100 years of African American theatre was
shown at NYU Gallatin and included images and artifacts of the African Grove Theatre, its actors
and productions9;

4Therefore be it resolved that Community Board 2, Manhattan urges New York University (NYU) to
name one of the three theaters that will sit on the historical home of the African Grove Theatre at 181
Mercer Street in honor of the The African Grove Theatre, and its significant role in NYC and American
history.
Vote: Unanimous, with 39 Board Members in favor.
5NEW APPLICATION FOR REVOCABLE CONSENT TO CONSTRUCT, MAINTAIN AND USE
AN OVERHEAD BUILDING PROJECTION (TRIANGLE FIRE MEMORIAL) ON 23-29
WASHINGTON PLACE (FOR NYU)
Whereas the deadly fire at The Triangle Shirtwaist Factory killed 146 victims on March 25, 1911 in the
Asch Building (now The Brown Building), and
Whereas Remember the Triangle Fire Coalition, a 501c3 nonprofit organization, is erecting a permanent
public memorial on the façade of the building where the fire took place, and
Whereas CB2 approved the project in December 2018, the Landmark Preservation Commission (LPC)
approved the project in March 2019, and the Department of Buildings (DOB) approved the project in
August 2019, and
Whereas the project needs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to give revocable consent because the
memorial overhangs the public sidewalk by 18 inches and needs to undergo a series of hearings before the
memorial can be fully installed.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that Community Board 2, Manhattan recommends approval for
revocable consent to construct, maintain and use an overhead building projection on 23-29 Washington
Place, provided that the application conforms with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and/or
restrictions, and clearance requirements.
Vote: Unanimous, with 39 Board Members in favor.

A RESOLUTION OPPOSING A DROP-IN CENTER WITH STABILIZATION BEDS AT 231
GRAND STREET
WHEREAS:
RECORD OF MEETINGS
1. The Human Services Committee of Manhattan Community Board 2 (CB2) has held and
participated in a series of meetings to discuss the proposed establishment of a Drop-In Center with
Stabilization Beds at 231 Grand Street in the neighborhood of Chinatown, to be operated by the
non-profit organization Housing Works (HW), with more details of such meetings to be provided
below; and
2. The first of such meetings was a presentation by HW to the Human Services Committee of CB2
by HW and attended by representatives of NYC Department of Social Services / Department of
Homeless Services (DSS/DHS) on February 24, 2022, and which included public comment; and
3. The second of such meetings was CB2’s Full Board meeting on March 24, 2022, at which
additional public comment was heard10; and
4. The third of such meetings was the CB2 Human Services Committee meeting on March 31, 2022,
at which a business session was held to discuss the writing of a resolution regarding the proposed
shelter; and
5. A written copy of the presentation by Housing Works and Charles King, its Chief Executive
Officer and Co-Founder, can be accessed below as well as on the CB2 website, which also
includes a full report from the February 24 meeting; and

BACKGROUND ON HOUSING WORKS11
6. Housing Works (HW) is a non-profit organization founded in 1990 to address homeless among
people living with HIV, with the distinction of being the first organization in the United States to
house homeless people without regard to their use of drugs in a supportive housing environment,
10 https://youtu.be/j5UD0-LTASM
11 https://www.housingworks.org
7and currently serving over 15,000 low-income New Yorkers including 2,000 people with HIV;
and
7. HW’s current services include a Federally Qualified Health Center (FWHC) operating five clinics
in Brooklyn and Manhattan, as well as over 700 units of supportive housing operated under harm
reduction principles that do not prohibit possession of drugs or alcohol, and supportive services
which include case management, substance abuse treatment, mental health care, and job
retraining; and
8. HW’s clientele largely consists of groups which have historically been the subject of
marginalization or discrimination, with a client base that is 51% black and 21% Hispanic, nearly
100% at or below the poverty line, 33% which have a history of incarceration, 33% which identify
as LGBTQ, 51% which have diagnosed mental health issues, and 26% of which are active
substance abusers; and
DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT AND SITE
9. 231 Grand Street is located on the corner of Bowery and Grand, within both the Chinatown
Business Improvement District (BID) and the broader Chinatown neighborhood, and currently
consists of an 8-story building which is zoned C6-1G and has an estimated gross floor area of
48,911 sf.12; and
10. The building at 231 Grand was formerly the Best Western Hanbee Hotel, which was recently used
for non-congregate housing for the homeless during the COVID-19 pandemic from Spring 2020 to
Summer 2021, and is currently vacant; and
11. Current activity on the block surrounding 231 Grand consists of a number of senior street vendors
selling food, a day care across the street, and businesses including a pharmacy, bank and bakery;
and
12. Pending approval of the budget and contract by NYC, HW has stated an intention to open this
facility by late Spring, 2022, the building having been recently renovated and in good condition;
and
13. As noted on the agenda of the March 10, 2022, Public Hearing of the Mayor’s Office of Contracts,
“The contract term shall be from March 1, 2022 to June 30, 2027 with one three-year renewal
option from July 1, 2027 to June 30, 2030. The contract amount will be $63,762,100. CB2,
Manhattan. E-PIN #07122P0011001”; and
14. HW intends the site to consist of a 1) Drop-in Center and 2) Stabilization Beds for unsheltered
homeless adult men and women, consisting of over 50 “drop-in” chairs and 94 stabilization beds,
and an outdoor deck for smoking; and
15. The model is considered the first of its kind and will be evaluated by DSS/DHS for outcomes; and
16. As with all new shelters in New York City, a “Fair Share” analysis is required to be completed
prior to opening the shelter which is required to examine conditions by 400-ft, 1000-ft, and 1/2 -
mile radius as well as by Community District.; and
12 http://maps.nyc.gov/doitt/nycitymap/
817. Although the site is located within Community District 2, which currently has no homeless
shelters, the neighborhood of Chinatown currently hosts shelters in Community Districts 1 and 3,
with an additional shelter in development in Community District 3; and
OVERVIEW OF THE DROP-IN CENTER
18. The Drop-In Center is intended to be a 24/7/365 walk-in facility providing meals, shower,
changing rooms, and laundry to homeless adult men and women, with 50-or-so lounge chairs
available but no beds; and
19. The Drop-In Center will offer a host of services aimed at long-term wellness, with staff including
a housing placement specialist, social workers, medical and psychiatric nurse practitioners, and
access to telehealth, and with on-site staff which speak English, Mandarin, Cantonese and
Spanish; and
20. The facility will follow a “harm-reduction” model, which means that visitors will not undergo
checks for illegal substances, with such design intended as a “low-threshold” program in order to
reduce barriers to entry and to entice individuals toward receiving social services; and
21. HW will hire peer outreach workers, including from Chinatown, to conduct street outreach in the
area and raise awareness among the homeless population regarding the existence of the Drop-In
Center; and

22. The proposed site will also consist of 94 “stabilization” beds, designed for use by adult men and
women who have been living without shelter and have refused the traditional shelter that New
York City provides, by law, to anyone who requests it; and
23. Candidates will be referred to the stabilization beds from outreach teams from both the Manhattan
Outreach Consortium13 as well as from HW’s owned trained peer outreach workers, and will focus
on working in a catchment area that will include Sara D. Roosevelt Park to the east and
Washington Square Park to the west but that will seek to cover all nearby areas of need; and
24. Housing Works will be expected, by contract with DSS/DHS, to transition these clients to
permanent housing within a period of twelve months; and
25. Similar to the Drop-In Center, the model for use of the stabilization beds is intended to be flexible
and “low-threshold,” with the baseline criteria for eligibility to a stabilization bed being evidence
of living on the street; and
26. Given the site’s proximity to facilities serving children, sex offenders with residential restrictions
would not be permitted to reside at 231 Grand Street14; and

9THE NEED FOR SHELTERS IN NEW YORK CITY
27. The need for additional homeless shelters in New York City is well-established, with the City
currently operating an “Open RFP” program for the establishment of new shelters; and
28. As a right-to-shelter city, NYC’s DSS/DHS is required by law to provide shelter to any individual
who seeks it; and
29. The current population in the city’s shelter system is approximately 48,413, including 15,057
children,15 and a vacancy rate in 2018 of 1.5% vs. a goal of 3%16; and
30. Approximately 2,376 additional individuals were living on the city’s streets on January 26, 202117;
and
CONDITIONS AND CHALLENGES IN CHINATOWN DURING AND FOLLOWING THE COVID-
19 PANDEMIC
31. The proposed 231 Grand Street Shelter would be located within both the Chinatown BID and the
greater Chinatown community, which has experienced a unique and varied set of challenges in the
years following the COVID-19 pandemic; and
32. Such challenges include a significant increase in crime targeting Asian-Americans, with a 361%
increase in anti-Asian hate crimes recorded in 2021 in New York City according to the NYPD18,
and the group Stop AAPI Hate recording over 1,700 hate incidents towards Asian-Americans in
the state of New York from March 2020 through December 202119; and
33. The overall increase in crime has included a number of specific horrific and tragic crimes which
have recently been committed against Asian-Americans, including the murder of Christina Yuna
Lee in her Chinatown apartment on Chrystie Street in February 2022; and
34. These incidents have led to an increased environment of fear amongst residents of Chinatown,
with a recent survey indicating that 75% of Asian seniors in New York City are afraid to leave
home due to the rise in attacks on Asian-Americans20 and hundreds of residents lining up on the
street in Chinatown for pepper-spray giveaways21; and

21 https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/chinatown-free-pepper-spray/
1035. This increase in crime and fears for safety has been accompanied by economic hardship as well,
with an increase of 6,000% in Asian-Americans in New York state filing for unemployment at the
beginning of the pandemic, more than three times the rate of the general population22; and
36. This economic hardship has further led to fears around survival of the Chinatown culture
community, highlighted by the closure of iconic establishments such as Jing Fong in 2021, one of
17 restaurants in Chinatown that had already closed permanently by March 2021 as a result of the
pandemic23; and
37. Augmenting such challenges and hardships faced by Chinatown in the last two years, there is a
sense that the concerns of the community have not been adequately addressed by elected officials
given that Chinatown straddles multiple Community Districts as well as multiple existing and
proposed NY Congressional Districts24; and
OUTPOURING OF OPPOSITION
38. Amid this current environment within Chinatown, the community has expressed unprecedented
and sustained opposition to the proposed 231 Grand Street shelter, which is seen by many in the
community as an unfair burden to be placed on the Chinatown neighborhood at this time given
both the economic and safety-related issues currently facing the community, with this opposition
being expressed to CB2 on multiple occasions as outlined below; and
39. CB2’s Human Services Committee videoconference on February 24, 2022, was attended by over
200 people, with comments heard from over 20 attendees plus scores of comments in the Chat
section of the Zoom meeting; and
40. CB2’s Full Board videoconference on March 24, 2022, was attended by over 400 people, with
comments heard from 65 people, including elementary school students, residents, small business
owners, local church leaders in CB2, community constituents and visitors to the Chinatown
neighborhood during a four-hour public session, with all comments except two being in opposition
to the plan; and
41. The office of CB2 received over 3,600 postcards collected from Susan Lee, a Tribeca resident
representing New Yorkers for Downtown Recovery, which were signed by “residents, merchants,
patrons and visitors of Chinatown” expressing “outrage” at the proposed shelter; and
42. CB2 additionally received approximately thirty emails in opposition, as well as two emails in
support; and
43. The public comments heard and received by CB2 centered on a number of key issues and areas, as
further outlined below; and
22 https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/05/new-york-chinatown-11-september-covid-19-crisis
23 https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/10/nyregion/chinatown-restaurant-closures-coronavirus.html

=2#%26map=13.49/40.72239/-73.98988/30
1144. There were personal accounts given by those in attendance that the Chinatown community is
saturated with conditions that degrade quality of life, with the public speaking of a “steady
deterioration of quality of life” and asking for balance when placing shelters throughout the city;
and
45. Other concerns centered around the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes and the accompanying
heightened fear and anxiety in the neighborhood, as noted in points 32-34 of this resolution, with
business owners speaking of closing their businesses early to prevent employees’ having to walk
or commute home after sunset, and many commenters expressing their belief in a connection
between crime and homelessness and describing encounters with homeless individuals; and
46. Others expressed concerns that a new shelter would add to an already existing issue with drug use
and drug dealing, particularly in nearby Sara D. Roosevelt Park; and
47. Others noted concerns around mental illness among the homeless and were worried about
increased encounters with mentally ill individuals on the street; and
48. Commenters further noted that they felt that the above Quality-of-Life concerns had been borne
out during the time that 231 Grand served as a temporary shelter during the COVID-19 pandemic
with instances of harassment and encounters with mentally ill individuals occurring near the
shelter during this time; and
49. Others noted concerns that the proposed shelter would contribute to the already difficult economic
conditions in Chinatown; and
50. Other commenters specifically pointed to the proposed plans by the City to demolish a pre-
existing jail to construct a new borough-based jail in Chinatown, and believed that such a jail
would be an undue burden to the community in addition to the proposed shelter; and
51. Many commenters noted that there were already multiple existing shelters in Chinatown, as well
as others currently in development, and that although the proposed 231 Grand shelter would be the
first shelter open in CB2, there are already “6 shelters in the Chinatown area” and several others
proposed; and
52. Many noted the division of Chinatown amongst three community districts (as noted in point 37 of
this resolution) and felt the City had applied a “divide and conquer” strategy in order to site new
shelters in the Chinatown area, with this feeling of neglect from the City amplified by language
barriers that exists with many Chinatown residents; and
53. An overall general concern noted was that the homeless to be housed in the proposed shelter
would not be “from the neighborhood” and that the shelter would “bring more homeless into the
area” from outside the neighborhood; and
54. The range of concerns culminated with a repeated call for CB2 and elected officials to listen to
and respond to the concerns of the community by preventing the proposed shelter from opening at
this location; and
12ADDITIONAL SPECIFIC CONCERNS RAISED BY CB2 MEMBERS
55. In addition to the concerns and issues raised by community members, CB2 members also raised
specific concerns relating to the process for siting and evaluating the proposed 231 Grand Shelter,
with such concerns being outlined further below; and
56. Comments were made by CB2 members regarding the opacity of the process for developing the
Fair Share Analysis, which is not shared with the general public and does not define precisely
what a “fair” or “unfair” share is, and the question was raised as to why a “stripped down” version
of the Fair Share report could not be provided to the public, especially given the many comments
from Chinatown community members stating that the neighborhood was already shouldering its
“fair share”; and
57. Further concerns were raised that the Fair Share Analysis does not take into account shelters
which are in development but not complete, nor does it take into account facilities in development
such as the proposed jail which might impact quality of life, both of which possibly provide a
distorted view of the “fair share” given to Chinatown by the City and relevant agencies; and
58. Other concerns were raised over the lack of specific metrics to evaluate the success of the
proposed shelter structure (Drop-in Center with Stabilization Beds), given that the facility is the
first of its kind, and whether such metrics would include community impact measures such as
crime and drug use; and
59. Further concerns were raised that DSS/DHS had not defined when the pilot program would be
evaluated by them and what specifically would constitute program success, and whether the
facility would be shut or redesigned if unsuccessful; and
60. Concerns were raised over whether the City would definitively close existing hotels currently
being used as homeless shelters in Chinatown, which are slated to be closed in 2023; and
61. Many CB2 members expressed recognition of the need to continue building new homeless shelters
in NYC but believed that the concerns of the Chinatown community were valid and that CB2
should lend its voice in order to amplify the voices of Chinatown, which have seemingly been
unheard by the City and relevant agencies.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that Community Board 2, Manhattan (CB2) recognizes both the
legal obligation of New York City and the urgent need to provide shelter and services to the unhoused, as
well as recognizes the positive work historically performed by Housing Works, but believes that in certain
cases, serious concerns around equity and safety must be addressed before deciding to move forward
with a specific site; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that in the case of the proposed shelter at 231 Grand Street, CB2 has
serious concerns around the impact of COVID-19 and other factors in recent years on the Chinatown
community, as well as a seeming lack of sufficient engagement between City officials and the Chinatown
community; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that given these serious concerns, Community Board 2, Manhattan,
demands the following actions be undertaken prior to the consideration of any other shelters within the
Chinatown community, including the proposed shelter at 231 Grand Street; and
13FAIR SHARE ANALYSIS
1. Analysis of facilities in development and extinction, in addition to shelters and other facilities
currently in operation; and
2. Analysis of the impact of different types of facilities beyond shelters which are likely to have an
impact on quality of life in Chinatown, such the new planned “mega jail” on White Street; and
3. A definition of “fair” concentration vs. over-saturation.
PROGRAM EVALUATION
4. NYC Department of Social Services and Homeless Services (DSS/DHS) must provide written
commitment to the date when the shelter at 231 Grand Street, presented to CB2 as a pilot
program, as well as any other proposed shelter, will undergo program evaluation; and
5. DSS/DHS must provide written commitment to the metrics that will be measured, and include
among those impacts to the community, including crime, noise, trash, visible drug use, and other
negative factors.
WIND-DOWN OF EXISTING HOTEL SHELTERS
6. DSS/DHS provide written commitment that the hotels within Chinatown currently serving as
shelters will be closed by the end of 2023, as outlined in the DeBlasio administration’s “Turning
the Tide on Homelessness” and prior to the consideration of any new shelters in Chinatown.
RECOGNITION OF AND ENGAGEMENT WITH THE CHINATOWN COMMUNITY
7. Elected Officials including the Mayor’s office and NYC agencies – including NYPD, DOT, DPR,
DSNY, Small Business Services and more - acknowledge the deep impact of the COVID-19
pandemic and other factors on the Chinatown community, including increased hate crimes towards
Asian-Americans and violence, crime and fears for personal safety, economic hardship, and a decline
in the quality of life for many Chinatown residents; and that these entities make a deep and good faith
effort to engage with the Chinatown community regarding issues of representation, safety, equity and
Quality of Life. This should include safety and Quality of Life concerns regarding any of the
identified shelters within Chinatown.
BE IT FINALLY RESOLVED that, given that the City has not yet made extensive general engagement
or specific engagement on the topics identified above, Community Board 2 believes that the City should
not move forward with the current proposed 231 Grand Street shelter consisting of a Drop-in Center and
Stabilization Beds at this time.
Vote: PASSED: 37 Board Members in favor; 7 Board Members opposed (S. Aaron, C. Dignes, W.

LAND USE AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
NY State Assembly Bill Number A9675 (NY State Senate Bill Number S8793), an act to amend the
Interim Multiple Dwelling law in relation to occupancy of joint living-work quarters for artists.
1. The purpose of the bill is to permit residents who live in JLWQA units and were in residence prior
to December 31, 2021 to continue to occupy such units regardless of their status as certified
artists.
172. It would amend Article 7B of the Multiple Dwelling Law regarding Joint Live-Work Quarters for
Artists (JLWQA), not to be confused with the New York State Loft Law, which created New York
City’s Loft Board.
3. The bill was introduced to the NY State Assembly by Assemblymember Deborah Glick on March
28, 2022 and it would be effective immediately upon passage. It is co-sponsored in the NYS
Senate by State Sen. Brian Kavanagh (S8793).
4. The bill would cover units in manufacturing buildings converted to JLWQA that have either a
temporary or permanent Certificate of Occupancy (C of O) or who have applied for a JLWQA C
of O as of December 31, 2021.
5. Charlie Anderson, Assemblymember Glick’s director of community affairs and Charles LeDuc,
her legislative director, made a presentation regarding the intent and process of the bill.
6. More than 150 people registered for the meeting and no one spoke against this bill. Speakers urged
CB2 to approve it quickly and they addressed the following concerns:
§ How further modifications not covered in the proposed bill will be handled in future
legislation and the need to differentiate between what is within the purview of New York
State v. New York City
§ Plans to protect the artists and the artistic character of the neighborhood
§ Issues of inheritance
§ The need to update the definition of artist and reinvigorate the artist certification process
§ Preservation of JLWQA units as a form of affordable housing
§ The ramifications of this bill for coop and condo owners
§ Reconciling the difference in code requirements to obtain a Certificate of Occupancy
between JLWQA and residential units in the same building
§ How occupancy of JLWQA units after Dec. 31, 2021 will be handled
§ Responsibility for conversion costs
§ The role of the NYC Arts Fund
Therefore, be it resolved that CB2M wholeheartedly recommends approval of this bill and applauds
Assemblymember Deborah Glick for taking the first step on a matter of utmost concern to our
community.
Be it further resolved that CB2M urges the New York State Senate and the New York State Assembly to
advance this bill to the floor of both houses as quickly as possible so it can be passed during this
legislative session.

seating areas, games, storefront activations, and a flower market; and
Whereas, the proposed event for 2022 is on a significantly larger scale than the 2021 event, and would an
entail a partial or full closing of the majority of blocks within the Meatpacking District, effectively
creating a large pedestrianized district for the duration of the event; and
Whereas, similar to the 2021 event, activations would take place on public plazas within the Meatpacking
District, but certain activations for the 2022 event would also take place on the streets themselves,
including the flower market which will be located on Washington Street and would require a 29-day
concession from DoT to allow for vending and sales to take place on the street itself; and
Whereas, the applicant expressed the intention to employ VMS message boards, which should be
employed starting the weekend before the event, and placed at critical junctures on Horatio St.,
Greenwich St., and 12th St., in order to inform drivers of the street closures and which streets to avoid
and/or rerouting information; and
Whereas, the intended street closures would require the re-routing of the M-11 bus; and
Whereas, the applicant is presently developing a full management plan with its traffic and pedestrian
management team and the LEAF production team, and is also working closely with SAPO, CECM, DOT,
and the NYPD to support traffic management for the event; and
Whereas, numerous questions and concerns were raised by committee members, board members and
community members around the traffic impact of the significant closures being proposed by the applicant,
including:
● Impact on traffic in the residential areas south of the Meatpacking District; and
● Potential confusion of drivers, especially given the non-grid alignment and existing traffic patterns
in and around Meatpacking District, which could lead to increased congestion; and
● The need for a plan for ride share pick-ups and drop-offs, which are expected to be numerous on
Friday and Saturday night; and
● Impact on residents of the re-routing of the M-11 bus, including requiring residents to walk a
longer distance in order to catch the bus; and
21Whereas, the Quality of Life Committee would have preferred to review the fully developed management
plan and traffic study for the proposed event, including possible input from CB2’s Traffic &
Transportation Committee, but it was not ready in time for the April meeting and the CB2 meeting
calendar for May does not allow this to happen;
Therefore Be It Resolved that CB2 Manhattan recommends approval of the LEAF Festival of Flowers
(Sponsor: Meatpacking District Management Association) provided that the applicant promptly develops
and shares with CB2 a detailed traffic mitigation plan incorporating the hiring of adequate personnel to
manage traffic (similar to Hudson Square BID traffic managers) as well as guards to ensure security of the
structures and noise and nuisance control, and CB2 urges the applicant to further incorporate any further
questions and concerns from the board in the coming weeks into its final plans for the event.
Vote: Passed with 38 Board members in favor and one opposed (V. De La Rosa)

Therefore Be It Resolved that CB2 Manhattan recommends that P.A.L. Festival (Street Fair) (Sponsor –
Police Athletic League): Broadway between Waverly Place and East 14th St. [full street closure] be laid
over for review next month.
Vote: Passed unanimously with 39 Board members in favor.

including any and all COVID related orders and/or restrictions—and clearance requirements.
Vote: Passed unanimously with 39 Board members in favor.
22SCHOOLS & EDUCATION
Resolution in support of Food Service Bonuses for School Food Service Workers who Worked
Throughout the Pandemic Providing Meals to Students and the Community at Large
1. Whereas, it has come to the attention of the CB2 Schools & Education Committee that local
school food service workers worked throughout the pandemic providing meals to students and the
community at large; and
2. Whereas, some schools in CB2 were designated as “Grab’n’Go” sites serving food for not only
students but members of the community during the pandemic school closure, requiring school
food service workers to report to work physically every day in the midst of the pandemic; and
3. Whereas, these school food service workers have not been compensated for their work with
hazard pay; and
4. Whereas, CB2 Schools & Education Committee invited Amalaa Somwaru, School Food Service
Manager of P.S. 130 Hernando De Soto, to give background on this topic on Monday, April 11,
2022; and
5. Whereas, New York City’s Department of Education (DOE) has been one of the school districts
most adversely affected by COVID-19. But through the shutdowns, reopenings and continued
uncertainty, wholesome meals to students—and the community at large—has remained a constant;
and
6. Whereas, the Office of Food and Nutrition Services has produced nearly 100 million meals over
the last 13 months, serving an average of 300,000 to 500,000 students and adults per day25; and
7. Whereas, as only an example, in August of 2020, food service workers at P.S. 130 Hernando De
Soto served over 14,000 meals in a single day to Community Board 2 families and neighbors; and
8. Whereas, workers ensuring the food security of our children and neighbors are certainly essential
workers, without whom many thousands across the city would have gone hungry; and
9. Whereas, during the school year 2020-2021, roughly 45% of meals were served to students in
person and 35% to remote learners. The remaining 20% of meals were served to the general
public26; and
Therefore be it resolved Community Board 2 urges the city and state to utilize COVID-19 relief funds,
such as the Coronavirus Aid Relief, and Economic Security (CARES)27 and American Rescue Plan
(ARPA)28 Acts, to provide retroactive hazard pay to our essential, local school food service workers that served
our families during the pandemic.

Applicant stated the last ticket sale would be 9:30PM, the 12:00AM closing enabling patrons on a regular
basis to have drinks in the café/lounge after visiting the exhibits, this being in contradiction to the intent
of the later closing hour indicated on the Application; and
v. Whereas, the instant Application included live music and entertainment volume levels with live
music being for special events, the Applicant anticipating special events occurring one to two times per
week but not producing any acoustic report regarding soundproofing of the premises, there being no

being of particular concern to the 5th floor tenants in the building (the two residential units being rent-
stabilized) citing an extensive history of previous music and noise complaints, there being no plans for
new soundproofing provided, other local residents appearing raising issues with lines outside, sidewalk
congestion, music, conformance with newly enacted zoning regulations, public safety and department of

use, far exceeds the sq. ft. limit for eating and drinking establishments; and
vii. Whereas, this application being seasonal in nature and limited to one season and being for the
service of Beer and Wine only and thus not subject to the 500 Foot Rule; the Applicant agreeing to no live
music and background music only with closing hours of 11:00PM and service of alcohol ending at
10:00PM Sundays through Saturdays with events occurring on the 2nd floor only; the cellar and ground
floor will be operated primarily as ticketed exhibit spaces with alcohol permitted in the delineated ground
floor 44 seat café/lounge on a regular basis, but not being permitted in the exhibit spaces; and
viii. Whereas, despite the Applicant not doing any outreach to the community prior to appearing
before CB2, Man. despite many of the community leaders being known to the Applicant’s attorney, nor
did the Applicant conduct a sound study of the premises, the Applicant has executed and has had
notarized a Stipulations Agreement with CB2, Man. that they agreed to submit to the NYSLA and agreed
would be attached and incorporated into the method of operation of the Tavern Wine License thus
mitigating many of the concerns of the Committee and the Community, with those stipulations as follows:

pending SN#1336813)
i. Whereas, after circumventing CB2, Man.’s process for reviewing liquor license applications in
order to provide a recommendation to the Liquor Authority, the Applicant and the Applicant’s Attorney
appeared before CB2, Manhattan’s SLA Committee #1 via video conference for a final time to present an
application to the NYS Liquor Authority for an On-Premises Liquor License for a restaurant serving
Asian cuisine with high-end cocktails located on the first and second floors of a C6-1-zoned, two (2)-story
34commercial building (c. 1910,altered 1985) on 13th Street between 5th Avenue and University Place

Mansion du Croque Monsieur from 2012 to 2019 with a Restaurant Wine license (#1265139) and closing
hours of 12:00 AM, 7 days a week; and
v. Whereas, the Applicant provided CB2, Man. with a 30-day notice in February/2021 for an On-
Premises Liquor License, was placed on CB2’s March/2021 agenda and after much follow up from CB2,
Man. provided their questionnaire describing the operation as a family restaurant focused on Asian
cuisine with operating hours of 11:00AM to 11:00PM, 7 days a week; the Applicant requesting to layover
the Application until April/2021, the Application being placed on CB2, Man.’s April/2021 agenda at
which time the Applicant failed to appear providing no notice or reason to CB2 despite outreach from
CB2, Man., therefore CB2, Man. unanimously voted to recommend denial of the Application at its
April/2021 Full Board meeting due to the Applicant’s failure to appear; and
vi. Whereas, despite not appearing before CB2, Man. the Applicant filed an Application with the
NYSLA for an On-Premises Liquor License on June 24, 2021 with notice of a 500' hearing received by
CB2, Man. on July 6, 2021 that resulted in a favorable determination for the Application being made by
the Administrative Law Judge; the questionnaire being supplied for that hearing by the Applicant
incorrectly stating that the Applicant had met with the Municipality (CB2, Man.) and listing their hours of
operation from 11:00AM to 11:00PM, 7 days a week; due to a clerical issue relating to email, CB2 Man.’s
denial recommendation was not included in the 500' materials; and
vii. Whereas, CB2, Man. received notification of the scheduled February 16, 2022 NYSLA Full
Board hearing for this Application on January 31, 2022, prompting CB2, Man. to again do significant
outreach to the Applicant’s representative in an effort to have the NYSLA Full Board hearing adjourned
until CB2, Man. was afforded the opportunity to have a position on the Application; the Applicant being
placed on the March/2022 agenda as CB2, Man.’s February SLA meetings were scheduled for 1st and 3rd
of the month and the Applicant could not be added to the agenda at the very last minute; and
viii. Whereas, the Applicant and their Representative appeared before CB2, Man.’s SLA Committee in
March/2022, apologizing for its prior actions and not paying attention to the liquor licensing process, the
instant application having hours of operation now extending from the original 11:00PM closing presented
at the 500 ft hearing, to a 2:00AM closing 7 days a week with a focus on high end cocktails paired with
the food, the Committee having concerns that the instant Application differed in hours and concept from
what was presented to the NYSLA for the 500' hearing, the 500' hearing being the opportunity to
determine the facts in relation to the public interest portion of the 500' law, that the Applicant provided no
explanation for their failure to appear in March or April/2021 despite extensive outreach from CB2, Man.,
the premises having never had an On-Premises license before, the prior operation being for Restaurant
Wine License with a predominately lunch and early dinner operation closing at midnight, concerns being
raised that the proposed later hours, combined with the focus on high end cocktails, would lead the
establishment to operate as a bar scene later in the evening, the block being quiet in the evenings with
many surrounding residences, the Applicant having other restaurants in Manhattan with earlier closing
hours, having appeared before other community boards following their procedures and agreeing to
35stipulations, but being unwilling to reduce the hours at this location to those presented at the 500' hearing
or consider a Restaurant Wine instead of an On-Premises license, the Applicant having signed a lease for
the premises in January/2021, recently having opened the location for takeout; and
ix. Whereas, following the March/2022 meeting, the Applicant requested to return to CB2, Man. this
month (April/2022) with new representation again apologizing for their prior actions, not paying attention
to the liquor licensing process and for the actions of its former representative; the instant Application
again describing the method of operation as a restaurant focused on Asian cuisine with high end cocktails
and the hours remaining 11:00AM to 2:00AM, 7 days a week, again not consistent with the facts provided
at the 500ft hearing; petitions were supplied in support of the application but the majority of those
petitions did not list the hours and were not dated and included two letters of support listing the hours as
being from 11:00AM to 11:00PM with no targeted outreach to immediate neighbors; the same concerns
being raised again by the Committee, the Applicant after hearing the Committee’s concerns again,
agreeing to closing hours of Midnight Sundays through Wednesdays and 1:00AM Thursdays through
Saturdays, those hours remaining later than what was supplied to the NYSLA and to the Administrative
Law Judge conducting the 500 ft hearing in consideration of the public interest standard; and
x. Whereas, this Application being subject to the 500' rule requiring the Applicant to demonstrate
that the public interest would be served by adding another liquor license at this location; CB2 Man.’s SLA
Committee voted to recommend denial of the Application as presented, reasons including that the
application differed significantly from what was presented at the 500' hearing and that the statements
presented in the 500 ft hearing questionnaire were inconsistent with the facts and method of operation
presented to CB2 and to those who signed petitions; the Committee also offered a pathway to CB2’s
support of the Applicant if the Applicant would agree to closing hours of 12:00AM Sundays through
Saturdays (7 days a week), which is one hour later than the hours presented at the 500' hearing but in
alignment with other nearby restaurant hours, and other stipulations; the Applicant accepting that pathway
with closing hours of 12:00AM 7 days after the committee meeting; and,
xi. Whereas, the Applicant subsequently executed and has had notarized a Stipulations Agreement
with CB2, Manhattan that they agreed to submit to the NYSLA and agreed would be attached and
incorporated into the method of operation of the new On-Premises Liquor License, with those stipulations
as follows:
1. Premises will be advertised and operated as an Asian restaurant.
2. The hours of operation will be 11:00AM to 12:00AM Sundays through Saturdays (7 days a

stipulations would meet with the Authority’s approval in establishing public interest despite the
discrepancy presented by the applicant at the 500 ft. hearing, the hearing established to explicitly
review those significant elements for 500 ft. cases;
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that CB2, Man. recommends denial of the application for a new
On-Premises Liquor License application for Sum Yung Gai, LLC d/b/a Char’d, 17 E. 13th St., 1st & 2nd
Fl. 10003, unless the stipulations agreement the Applicant has executed is incorporated in the “Method of

the discrepancy in facts at the 500 ft hearing.

certificate of occupancy permitting eating and drinking use/occupancy in the basement—from 74 to 270
patrons, while also adding 6 additional exterior seats on a former loading dock, for a total of 20 seats on
the loading dock, the loading dock being adjacent to and connected by operable doorways from the
licensed interior premise, the loading dock being elevated above the sidewalk on West Street; and,
v. Whereas, in addition to increasing its patron capacity, the Applicant also sought to operate on the
public sidewalk directly in front of the loading dock, but due to concerns voiced that the sidewalk seating
proposed would block and not provide clear passage for pedestrians and strollers, the sidewalk in question
being a vital and significant throughfare for all those seeking to cross the West Side Highway to safely
access the Hudson River Park, Little Island Park, the Gansevoort Peninsula and its new sports field, a
children’s playground known as Pirate Park, and its many other attractions and piers, there being no other
access points for this purpose in the immediate area, the sidewalk also being a throughfare for those
seeking to continue up 10th Avenue along from the South to enter the Meatpacking District, the
Applicant in response to such concerns providing an amended diagram for such seating and reducing its
sidewalk seating to four (4) tables and eight (8) patron seats located immediately adjacent to loading dock
on its south end so as to not block the sidewalk; and,
vi. Whereas, in light of the significant increase and patron occupancy being proposed, the Applicant
in good faith met with the local block association and residents living on Horatio and Jane Streets because
the front entrance to the licensed premise is located on Horatio Street, where significant concerns were
raised relating to a significant increase of traffic, taxis/Ubers/private cars posed by the proposed change in
occupancy, with both and Horatio and Jane Streets existing as a one-way single driving lane “loop”
connecting the two blocks, surrounded by residential buildings, with no outlet or access to the West Side
Highway, requiring all traffic on Jane Street to circle back onto Horatio Street to access the front entrance
drop off/pick up location of the restaurant on Horatio, this particular restaurant having a significant
reputation, being a very popular destination location for tourists and others coming into this residential
neighborhood to enjoy its offerings; and,
vii. Whereas, there also a second on premise liquor license application pending with the NYSLA to
be sited on the same Horatio to Jane Street loop—The Jane St. Social Club, Inc. d/b/a SVB NYC, at 113
Jane St.—a Members Only Club on five floors and rooftop with a patron capacity of 750 and hours of
operation until 4 AM), another destination location with a significant occupancy proposed, further
exacerbating the existing traffic concerns for the instant application, where there is no public
transportation hub within close proximity to/from the immediate area, insufficient available parking to
help alleviate the inevitable increase of noise and traffic congestion in the area generated by the new
liquor licenses to be issued on the same roadway loop; and,
48viii. Whereas, as a result of meeting in good faith with residents and the local block association, the
Applicant and the residential community sought to work out an agreement on stipulations, based on
concessions advanced by both sides, in an attempt to ameliorate the significant, known impacts the
issuance of the license will have on the existing residential community; and,
ix. Whereas, in light of the significant impacts posed by this proposed license on the surrounding
community, an agreement was reached in compromise and to limit the anticipated impacts on the
Community, the Applicant executing a stipulations agreement with CB2, Man. that they agreed would be
attached and incorporated into the method of operation on the new restaurant on-premise liquor license
stating that:

sq. ft. and was previously operated and occupied as the Jane Hotel; and,
iii. Whereas, with the exception of the 4th floor, the new private members club will be occupying a
large portion of the spaces on each floor previously occupied by the Hotel, but will operate independently,
in contiguous but physically separate spaces, with a separate entrance on Jane Street while the Hotel will
continue to operate with a smaller footprint and a smaller number of single occupancy rooms next door,
many of which house and are occupied by long-term tenants, protected by law; and,
iv. Whereas, the new membership only club will also operate in the basement, the basement having
a roughly 1,900 sq. ft. kitchen servicing all floors of the membership club, the basement also containing
the Music Room space, the Music Room space being 725 sq. ft. where there will be 6 tables and counter
seating for a total of 30 seats; the eastern side of the ground floor containing the 3,284 sq. ft. private

levels existed at the Jane Hotel, from roughly 350 patrons throughout all the event spaces operated by the
Hotel, to a patron occupancy of 750 when combining all the multiple, designated eating and drinking
venues within the new membership club, this increase in capacity being a significant concern for the
surrounding community, triggering the potential for a significant increase of traffic, including for-hire
taxis/Ubers/private cars, due to the proposed change in occupancy levels, with Jane Street existing as a
one-way, cobble stone roadway with a single driving lane, that has no outlet or access to the West Side
Highway, requiring all traffic on Jane Street to then circle or loop around West Street to Horatio Street
when accessing the entrance drop off/pick up location of the private members club, with both Jane and
Horatio Streets being connected, the two blocks being occupied and surrounding by residential buildings,
with the private membership club being a popular destination location with no facilities for parking in the
immediate area, without close access to a public transportation hub to help alleviate the inevitable
increase of noise and traffic congestion in the area generated by the new liquor license; and,
vii. Whereas, in light of the significant increase and patron occupancy being proposed, the Applicant
in good faith met with the local block association and residents living on Horatio and Jane Streets, with
the assistance and encouragement of CB2 Man., those discussions taking place over three months, with
the principal and operator of the private members club directly involved in those discussions, with the
immediately surrounding community organized and opposed to this application, the owner/operator of the
Jane Hotel having a significant and well documented history since the inception of its license in 2008 for
creating unreasonable disturbances and noise impacts on its residential neighbors over many years by
operating a night club at the Hotel, with dancing and DJs, leading to its forced, temporary closure by the
City of New York Department of Building for failing to operate with the proper permits due to excessive
patron occupancy levels, triggering fines levied by the NYSLA, with the Hotel upon its initial application
with CB2, Man. in December/2007, falsely presenting its method of operation to this Community Board
as a Hotel operating with background music only; and,
viii. Whereas, after extensive discussions were held between the Community and principal operator of
SVB, with SVB agreeing and executing a notarized Stipulations Agreement with CB2, Man. which will
be incorporated into the Method of Operation for the Private Members Club liquor License, as follows:
HOURS:
The premises will have a hard closing time (all patrons off premises) of 2:00 AM seven days a week,
except for the Music Room and Library which will have a hard closing time of 2:00AM Sunday -
Wednesday and 4:00 AM Thursday - Saturday.
The Restaurant will have a ""last reservation"" time of 10:30 PM seven days a week. No more than 60 walk
ins will be allowed after 10:30 PM. The purpose of this restrictions is to minimize the number of people
exiting onto Jane Street late at night, and thereby reduce noise and traffic issues on the Jane/Horatio Street
loop.
The roof exterior spaces will close at 11:00 PM seven days a week. Rooftop service will be for seated
patrons only. All patrons will be cleared at this hour and area closed.
SVB will not permit occupancy/use 2nd floor balconies after 11:00 PM every night and will inform
patrons/members and their guests of this club policy.
53EVENTS:
“Events” are defined as occasions for which there is a scheduled reservation for an *entire* space with
more than 40 people attending. This includes both events organized by SVB and events for which
members are renting a space. The purpose of the following restrictions on Events is to minimize the
number of people exiting onto Jane Street at any one time, and thereby reduce noise and traffic issues on
the Jane/Horatio Street loop.
There will be a maximum of 10 Events in the first floor, eastside Dining Room Restaurant space per year.
The end times for Events with 40 or more people will be staggered by at least 30 minutes - ie, no Event
with 40 or more people can be scheduled to end within 30 minutes of another Event with 40 or more
people. There can be 20 exceptions to this per year.
MUSIC:
All spaces will be ""quiet background music only"" (no DJs, no live music) except during Events. The two
exceptions are the Restaurant, where there can be live *acoustic* music (no brass instruments, no drum
sets), and the basement Music Room where there can be DJs and live music at any time. The live acoustic
music in the Restaurant will end no later than Midnight (this does not apply to Events).
There will be no music at any time on the rooftop exterior spaces, no exceptions for Events.
There will be ""quiet background music only"" in the interior roof spaces, no exceptions for Events.
There will be ""quiet background music only"" on the second floor, no exceptions for Events.
SVB will not permit music on the 2nd floor balconies and will inform members and their guests of this
policy, no exceptions for Events.
There will be ""quiet background music only"" in the Library when it is open after 2:00 AM, no exceptions
for Events.
The restaurant will have a sound system tested by Al Fierstein, with multiple small speakers and a volume
limiter so that music will not be audible in surrounding residences so as to cause a disturbance. In
addition, SVB will have a house sound system tested by Al Fierstein with a volume limiter so that music
will not be audible in surrounding residences so as to cause a disturbance. All DJs and live music groups
will be required to plug into the house (or restaurant) system, and volume limiter settings must remain
unchanged from the level established by Al Fierstein. DJs and live music groups will not be permitted to
bring their own sound systems.
No subwoofers will be allowed at any time, except in the Music Room and the two Screening Rooms (3rd
Floor). The Screening Rooms sound systems will be used only when showing movies. Al Fierstein will
test the soundproofing in the finished Music Room and Screening Room to prevent deep bass frequencies
from escaping and will test to ensure that the containment of deep bass frequencies is effective.
SVB will not use the rear terrace adjoining the restaurant until it is enclosed; the sound insulating
properties of the enclosure will be tested by Al Fierstein before it goes into operation to ensure that it
complies with his specifications.
Al Fierstein will test the sound insulating properties of the enclosure for the rooftop ""Indoor Space North""
planned on diagram submitted to ensure that it complies with his specifications.
TRANSPORTATION:
SVB will designate a Traffic Management Liaison who will be responsible for managing the entrance
including the sidewalk and curb lane and ensure continual pedestrian and emergency services access. The
Liaison would serve as the single point of contact and be accessible to the community and local police
precinct should any issue arise, so they are documented and addressed immediately. The community will
be given a phone number for the manager on duty.
54SVB will direct security or other hotel staff to monitor pick up/drop off activity during the weekdays and
weekends. During Events, as defined above, the security or other hotel staff will have a visible outdoor
presence and be responsible for discouraging vehicle drop-off and picks-ups in the middle of Jane Street,
keeping the adjacent sidewalk clear, trash-free and keeping noise-levels at a minimum.
SVB will work with membership and Uber/Lyft and other taxi services to identify a location away from
Jane Street for “For-Hire” vehicle pick up and drop off.
SANITATION:
SVB will internally cold-store organic waste and only take bags out as close to the time of carter’s
expected arrival as reasonably possible. This should reduce the presence of pests.
SVB will use the carter already serving this location, provided the cater is available, so as not to add any
additional traffic to the street.
SVB will also place both organics and recyclables on the eastern sidewalk of West Street and not along
Jane Street not only to keep waste as far away from residents as possible but also to keep the sidewalks
along Jane Street clear.
SECURITY:
SVB will have a 24-hour full time staff and will have security generally between 10 pm and 6 am on days
the club is open.
SVB will direct security personnel or other hotel staff members to do perimeter sweeps every other hour
to use best efforts to ensure no loitering or blockage of sidewalks and their immediate neighbors’
property.
MISCELLANEOUS:
SVB will not use outside third party promoters to operate in or run events or functions. SVB’s use of
marketing and PR staff and people, in house and third party, shall not be considered use of a promoter
under this section.
There will be no velvet ropes and SVB will use best efforts to not cause a line to form outside of the
premises.
SVB will make best efforts to schedule deliveries between 7:00 AM and 5:00 PM.
ix. Whereas, despite the stipulation agreement brokered between the Community and the Applicant,
legitimate questions still remain as to whether the Applicant has satisfied the statutory elements of a Club
License, and other NYS regulations governing not-for-profit entities or organizations, where such license
may only be issued to an organization operated solely for recreational, social, patriotic, political,
benevolent or athletic purposes, and which may not be issued where the intent is to traffic in alcoholic
beverages for profit or for pecuniary gain; and,
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that CB2, Man. requests the Licensing Division of the NYSLA
review and determine whether the membership club operated by the Applicant properly qualifies for the
class of liquor license being sought; and
THEREFORE BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that if the Applicant does qualify for such license,
CB2, Man. recommends denial of the application for a new Club liquor license to Jane St. Social Club,
Inc. d/b/a SVB NYC, 115 Jane St. 10014 unless the statements the Applicant has presented are accurate
and complete and that the above-stated conditions and existing stipulations agreed to by the Applicant are

TRAFFIC AND TRANSPORTATION
Resolution in support of co-naming the n.w. corner of 5th Ave. and Washington Sq. N. Edie
Windsor and Thea Spyer Way.
Whereas a request was presented to co-name the n.w. corner of 5th Ave. and Washington Sq. N. Edie
Windsor and Thea Spyer Way in recognition of their role in establishing a long-denied civil right of the
LGBTQ+ community, a group that has had a large, significant and enduring presence in Greenwich
Village for over 100 years and that has played a vital role in helping shape the Village's unique,
innovative and artistic character and its open-minded, progressive, humanistic values; and
Whereas Edie Windsor and Thea Spyer were married in Canada in 2007, and although their same-sex
marriage was legally recognized by New York State in 2008, it wasn't recognized in federal law. The
Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) Section 3 held that the term ""spouse"" applied only to marrage between
a man and woman. A lawsuit brought by Edie Windsor claiming spouses' rights in relation to hers and
Thea Spyer's marriage led to the recognition of the legality of same-sex marriages throughout the United
States; and
Whereas in 2013, in the landmark case of United States v Windsor, in response to Edie Windsor's
lawsuit, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Section 3 of DOMA as unconstitutional and ""a deprivation
of the liberty of the person protected by the Fifth Amendment"" and its guarantee that no person shall be
""deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law."" This gave same-sex married couples
rights to federal benefits that only heterosexual married couples were allowed previously; and
Whereas Edie Windsor and Thea Spyer lived together in Greenwich Village for over 43 years, and during
that time were actively engaged in championing and pursuing LGBTQ+ rights and civil liberties within
the community and serving people's special needs:
• They were founding members of the LGBT Center at 208 W. 13th St., as well as of SAGE,
New York's oldest advocacy group for LGBTQ+ elders (originally located in the 208 W.
13th St. building too), and the Callen-Lourde Health Center (originally located nextdoor to
208 W. 13th), which provides medical services to members of the local community,
including at risk youth.
• They volunteered their services at these and other community institutions on a steady
basis. Edie Windsor, who was a Senior Systems Programmer at IBM (the organization's
highest rank) brought in and set up all the technology for the LGBT Center, SAGE and
Callen-Lourde and aided in the learning of how to run these systems. Thea Spyer, a
59dedicated clinical psychologist in private practice, voluntarily counseled patients at Callen-
Lorde and treated AIDS patients at St. Vincent's Hospital when no one else would.
• They supported and were involved in the activities of Congregation Beit Simchat Torah,
New York City's LGBTQ+ synagogue, at the time located at 56 Bethune St. in the West
Village.
• They devoted their entire lives to advocating for LGBTQ+ rights, by volunteering,
organizing, contributing support, and participatng in numerous initiatives, marches,
demonstrations, and other events throughout Greenwich Village, such as the Gay Pride
Parade and Stonewall commemoration.; and
Whereas a petition supporting the co-naming of the n.w. corner of 5th Ave. and Washington Sq. N. Edie
Windsor and Thea Spyer Way was submitted with almost 200 signatures, including signatures from NY
State Senator Brad Hoylman and NY State Assembly Member Deborah Glick, both of who live in and
represent Greenwich Village and include Community Board # 2, Manhattan in their districts, with close to
100 of the signatures from the building located at that proposed 5th Ave. and Washington Sq. N. corner;
and
Whereas letters of support for the co-naming were received from the LGBT Center, Callen-Lorde Health
Center and Judson Memorial Church; and
Whereas co-naming the corner of 5th Ave. and Washington Sq. N. after Windsor and Spyer is fitting
both because they lived there (at 2 5th Ave.), directly across from Washington Sq. Park, and because the
Park itself has been the site of so many happenings in the LGBTQ+ rights movement, among them a rally
that began there to protest the police's actions at Stonewall, gatherings after the Pride Parade, the wrap up
of the Dyke March, and celebration of the Trans Day of Action;
Therefore be it resolved that CB2 fully supports co-naming the n.w. corner of 5th Ave. and Washington
Sq. N. Edie Windsor and Thea Spyer Way.
Vote: Unanimous, with 39 Board Members in favor.

(and subsequently the NYSLA) for a RW license (Badhair, LLC SN#1315500) for a multi-floor
establishment at another location and signed and executed a detailed stipulation agreement which
included agreeing to only have live acoustic piano on the weekends in the basement venue operating
under a separate dba as accessory to the establishment with no drums, no brass, no electric guitars or bass
instruments and no scheduled performances, no events where a cover fee is charged, yet the premises
were in fact opened and operated openly as a full Jazz Club and written up in publications such as the
online local food media Eater New York on June 11, 2019 in an article titled “Nightlife Hitmaker Ariel
Arce Opens a Seductive Retro Jazz Club in Soho” with a photo showing piano, trumpet, upright bass and
drums and article stating there will be two shows a night with a cover charge of $20; the premises own
website also stating two shows a night Wednesday through Saturday with a cover charge of $20 and using
a similar photo; Yelp reviews from Fall 2019 also mentioning scheduled performances, jazz bands and
showing different photos that included drums, brass instruments and upright bass; the elements regarding
operation of live music in that stipulation agreement being a critical element of CB2’s recommendation
which allowed the license to be approved by the SLA absent an appearance before the Full Board; and

being a standard method of establishing public interest, there being real concerns raised about possible
outdoor rooftop use despite any stipulations agreements that might be entered into based on the past
history of the Applicant blatantly disregarding stipulations agreement, the third floor rooftop coming
before and approved by CB2, Man. Landmarks Committee in June/2021 for a formal build out with
access via both an interior stairway from all floors and a doorway from the third floor and a clear quality
of life impact should that area be operated as part of the licensed premises and no other reason the
applicant would not operate the area except their representations; and

and
ii. Whereas, this Bar has only operated for a few months, having opened in May/2021 as a diner/dive
bar hybrid within a 4-story, 1860’s townhouse building in a residential neighborhood on Bedford Street at

and would close all doors at all times except for patron ingress and egress; and,

using a previously unused (and not identified for such use in its original application) side door on Leroy
St. to serve patrons outside, placing tables and chairs on the sidewalk on both Leroy and Bedford Streets
and having built two covered structures in the roadbed, one on Leroy Street with eight rows of bench
seating, installing electrical conduits for lighting fixtures and speakers for playing music, and a second

surrounds, the doors to the establishment being left open at all times, there being concerns about rat
infestation, establishing unreasonable and significant intrusions on their lives, in addition to the the grave
concerns for pedestrian safety and vehicle traffic at the immediate intersection posed by the newly built
structure blocking and obstructing the stop sign; and,

recommended additional, supplemental stipuations to the Licensee as follows:
All Existing and previously agreed upon Stipulations will remain in place. This Supplemental
Stipulation agreement is for the sole purpose of operating on a temporary basis in the roadbed
space immediately adjacent to and in front of the licensed premise.

43SOHO/NOHO WORKING GROUP
Opposition to the City’s Proposed Plan to Rezone SoHo, NoHo and Chinatown
ULURP Application Nos. C210422 ZMM, N210423 ZRM; Draft Environmental Impact Statement
CEQR No. 21DCP059M
Whereas:
A. The proposed SoHo, NoHo and Chinatown rezoning fails to achieve affordable housing goals
and instead incentivizes office, dormitory and large retail development and will displace existing
rent-protected and low-income residents.
1. Manhattan Community Board 2 (CB2, Man.) is committed to the protection of existing rent-
regulated housing and the creation of new equitable affordable housing for NYC residents who are
most in need.
2. The SoHo NoHo Neighborhood Plan (the Mayor’s Plan) is unlikely to produce any affordable
housing, while being falsely presented as a proposal to expand affordable housing and instead
incentivizes commercial and dormitory uses.
3. The Mayor's Plan fails to protect against displacement, particularly for residents in Chinatown,
seniors aging-in-place and tenants who are rent stabilized, rent controlled or protected under New
York State Loft Law.
4. The Mayor’s Plan also fails to secure the future or consider expansion of the highly successful
JLWQA use as well as fails to mitigate the significant adverse impacts on open space, shadows,
historic and cultural resources, transportation and construction noted in the Draft Environmental
Impact Statementi (DEIS).
5. Adaptive reuse has been the heart of NoHo and SoHo’s success. Artists and small retailers
transformed a dying industrial district into a highly distinctive, architecturally significant, world-
renowned neighborhood.
6. In its wake, the Mayor's Plan will eliminate the zoning that makes these historic districts unique,
attractive and highly successful.
7. The Final Scope of Work (FSOW) of the Mayor's Plan remains virtually unchanged from the Draft
Scope of Work (DSOW) and ignores recommendations from sincere housing and community
advocates – including CB2’s own detailed, 40-page critique of the Draft Scope of Work – and
from the Envision SoHo/NoHo report and Advisory Group sponsored by DCP, Manhattan
Borough President Gale Brewer and Council Member Margaret Chin.
8. The rushed rezoning plan is designed to coincide with the last days of Mayor de Blasio’s
administration and prevents input from the incoming mayor and city council.
9. The plan, conceived during the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic, cannot take into account post-
pandemic changes in live-work and usage of commercial space.
10. The city’s public meetings, none of which were held in-person, failed to include members of the
Chinatown community, where almost half of the projected new development will be built.
44For all these reasons, and for the specific areas of concern detailed below, Manhattan Community
Board 2 rejects the City’s fundamentally flawed and unacceptable SoHo NoHo Neighborhood Plan.
B. Key Areas of Concern
1. The Mayor's Plan Fails to Guarantee Any Critically Needed Affordable Housing.
a. The City admits that there is zero guarantee that any affordable housing units will be
created as a result of the proposed Plan.
b. The rezoning will incentivize the replacement of existing architecture with new, out-of-
scale luxury residential structures with a minimal number of affordable units or with
commercial or dormitory uses. Mandatory Inclusionary Housing (MIH) (i) allows building
enlargements with no affordable housing required, (ii) creates new luxury housing with no
affordable housing on site if the developer pays into a housing opportunity fund to build it
elsewhere, (iii) permits exemptions based on deep lot size and small building footprints
and (iv) most importantly, fails to create affordable housing for those most in need in our
communityii – at income levels that fall below 40% Area Median Incomeiii (AMI).
c. These incentives for commercialiv and dormitory use as well as the proposed modification
to preserve large buildings (60,000 sq. ft. and larger) for commercial usev, will result in a
proliferation of large office and/or other commercial structures with no affordable housing
at all.
d. The addition of residential use will allow dormitories of up to 6.5 FAR, which were
previously not permitted and, given the limited development sites and proximity to a
number of universities, will create another use that competes against affordable housing.
e. In fact, the Mayor's Plan will likely result in a net reduction of the number of affordable
housing units. It incentivizes the demolition of existing low-rise buildings and the
displacement of rent-stabilized tenants in at least 635 rent-regulated units and likely
much more in at least 185 buildings. vi These units are disproportionately located in the
rezoning areas with the highest proposed upzonings – the 12 FAR zones – and are
therefore especially threatened by the plan. Particularly at risk are residents in Chinatown
(located in the SoHo East designated opportunity zone, where one property owner has
multiple contiguous properties that will benefit from higher commercial FAR) and senior
citizens aging-in-place, especially those tenants in smaller JLWQA and rent-stabilized
buildings, which are prime targets for demolition.
f. The Mayor's Plan will fail to achieve a more socioeconomically and racially diverse
neighborhood in part because MIH relies on large-scale luxury development with low
numbers of affordable units.
g. Any future rezoning plan must review and include protections for tenants at risk of
displacement.vii
h. CB2 also insists that any rezoning plan addresses options for adding more permanently
affordable housing, including supportive housing, without the addition of more luxury
housing, including (i) incentivizing adaptive reuse and sustainability, (ii) converting empty
hotels and offices to affordable housing; (iii) constructing 100% affordable housing on the
federally-owned parking lot at 2 Howard Street under existing HPD programs, (iv)
45identifying opportunities to build more affordable housing, particularly on vacant sites,
while addressing displacement concerns, and (v) acquiring and subsidizing the
development of 100% affordable housing and/or supportive housing on sites within the
rezoning area, including bold and imaginative uses of the limited developable land in
SoHo, NoHo and Chinatown.
2. Zoning changes will squeeze out small retail stores and negatively impact quality of life for
current and future residents.
a. CB2 supports allowing as-of-right ground-floor local retail less than 10,000 sq. ft. under
Use Group 6, appropriate for a mixed-use residential district.
b. CB2 supports maintaining a special permit for retail more than 10,000 total sq. ft., as is the
case in most commercial districts in the cityviii to ensure community input in the creation of
large-scale retail uses and to give voice to and support small business owners and opposesix
any zoning-led bailout for overleveraged retail property owners.x
c. CB2 continues to supports the enforcement of the city’s loading berthxi requirements to
reduce noise, pollution and congestion from frequent deliveries and trash pickup, based on
total selling space, including basements.
d. CB2 supports maintaining a size limit and creating a special permit for eating and drinking
establishments above 5,000 sq. ft. or seating capacity above 200, similar to requirements in
the nearby Special Hudson Square Districtxii and Special Tribeca Mixed Use District.
e. The Mayor's Plan projects residential use to increasexiii but does not address quality of life
concerns for current and future residents. Any future rezoning plan should (i) require a
special permit for any commercial rooftop or outdoor eating and drinking, club, meeting
hall, event space, accessory to retail or catering uses and (ii) prohibit eating and drinking
uses and high-impact retail uses above the 2nd floor. To date, voluntary city programs,
including those promoted by our area’s Business Improvement Districts, have not
successfully addressed quality-of-life concerns for the residential community and should
not be expected to mitigate those known impacts in the future.
f. CB2 does not support new developments or conversions that mix commercial and
residential on the same floor, nor places commercial uses above existing residential uses
within a building.
3. The Proposed “Mechanism” for Converting Manufacturing Use Group 17-D, Joint Living-
Work Quarters for Artists (JLWQA), to Residential Use Group 2 Creates Adverse and
Unknown Consequences for Current Residents and will Eliminate this Unique Use.
a. The Mayor's Plan would eventually eliminate Manufacturing Use Group 17-D JLWQA
units, the defining characteristic of SoHo and NoHo’s M1-5A and M1-5B zoning
districtsxiv through a last minute and ill-conceived “mechanism” to remove this special use.
Payments into an undefined Arts Fund do not provide a long term sustainable model using
one-time contributions and DCP provided no financial analysis to support this
proposal despite repeated requests from CB2.
46b. The proposed “mechanism” does not meet the stated goal of creating dedicated space for
arts & culture through mandated space within buildings per zoning requirements, instead
relying on arbitrary decisions directed by market forces and availability, and only then
would an arts or culture use have an option for a grant to rent space.
c. Why 17-D? Manufacturing Use Group 17-D is the unique designation of space for the
manufacture of art, which also allows for residential use and requires occupancy by at least
one certified artist in each unit. This permitted the adaptive reuse of disused manufacturing
spaces for arts and residential uses and set in place similar movements to revitalize
industrial districts in cities around the world.
d. Plan Ignores Existing Population of Artists. Despite large numbers of Certified Artists
who participated in the Envision SoHo/NoHo process and continue to utilize JLWQA units
for the production of art, DCP vastly underestimates the number of working artists in SoHo
and NoHo and abruptly forms its own conclusions through incorrect interpretations of the
state’s Department of Cultural Affairs (DCLA) data (there is no requirement that all artists
must go through certification) and a yawning lack of interest in the underlying reasons for
the drop in applications over the decades (a regimen of non-enforcement and a lengthy
certification process).
e. Expanding Definitions. The Mayor’s Plan ignores Envision SoHo/NoHo’s
recommendations to “consider a potential expansion of live-work definition that reflects
current and future trends” nor does it “encourage and support artist/maker/cultural worker
occupancies.” This would evolve this unique and emulated use to include a broader
spectrum of certified artists or makers.xv
f. Punitive Fee. The Mayor's Plan imposes a $100 per sq. ft. conversion fee that is
financially punitive, particularly to pioneering legally conforming senior citizens who are
aging-in-place and who went through considerable hardship to legalize their spaces and
buildings under the current zoning laws. In addition, the conversion fee does not mitigate
any adverse impact from the Mayor's Plan in Soho, NoHo, or Chinatown, especially the
elimination of art manufacturing spaces.xvi Meanwhile, the Mayor's Plan would newly
allow as-of-right ground floor retail, department store, dormitory, and other uses, and
significant increases to commercial FAR, at no cost to commercial building owners.
Moreover, the Mayor's Plan fails to make a distinction between those property owners who
legally conform to the current zoning requirements and those who do not, which results in
an excessive punitive conversion fee for those who have gone to great lengths to both
convert and legally occupy Use Group 17-D spaces.
g. Cost for Building Code Consequences. The Mayor's Plan neither adequately considers
nor did DCP adequately explore the complexity and impact of converting Manufacturing
Use Group 17-D JLWQA units to Residential Use Group 2 units including the myriad
changes required by the city’s building code compliance during conversion from a
manufacturing to a residential use and the associated costs to the “pathway to legalization”
including architects, engineers, lawyers and tradespeople to do the necessary work to be
code-compliant.
h. Displacement of Rent-Protected JLWQA Tenants. The Mayor's Plan fails to adequately
address harm that could occur to current rent regulated tenants residing in rent-stabilized
loft law/former Interim Multiple Dwelling (IMD) JLWQA units or those currently
47protected by the loft law; DCP has acknowledged that they are not experts on loft law
unitsxvii and have not initiated any conversations with our local state elected officials on the
impacts on these tenants.
i. Adverse Impacts on Individual Owners. The Mayor's Plan fails to adequately address
co-ops or condos and the likelihood that these boards could impose conversions from Use
Group 17D to Use Group 2 for all existing JLWQA units throughout their building. As a
result, individual shareholders or owners could face elimination of allowable arts uses and
significant financial hardship, up to and including loss of their unit.
j. Ill-Conceived Arts Fund. The creation of an Arts Fund is ill conceived because it fails to
acknowledge or memorialize the contributions of artists to adapting, reusing and rebuilding
SoHo and NoHo and instead would simply create a non-city source for arts funding to
distribute beyond the SoHo, NoHo and Chinatown proposed rezoning area which would
not reflect the loss of spaces for the creation of art in SoHo and NoHo. In 1973, the
Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) stated that “the [SoHo-Cast Iron Historic]
district demonstrates one way in which the core of an old city can be given new life
without the destruction of its cultural heritage.”xviii
k. CB2 supports the continued evolution of JLWQA, not its replacement with Residential Use
Group 2xix, updating and reviewing the definition of “Artist” as defined by the state and
administered by the Department of Cultural Affairs (DCLA), such as the inclusion of
Maker and other living-work uses.xx
l. Given the complex interplay between the city’s zoning text and Article 7-B in the state’s
Multiple Dwelling Law, CB2 supports working in tandem with local state elected officials
before proposing changes to JLWQA. To date, DCP has not done this.
4. Massive Increases in Allowable Square Footage will Erase the “Historic” of the Once-
Historic Districts and fundamentally transform SoHo, NoHo and Chinatown.
a. CB2 opposes the proposed increase in allowable Floor Area Ratio (FAR) – from the
current level of 5 to levels up to 12, the maximum FAR allowed under New York State
law. This FAR increase incentivizes the demolition of existing buildings in the six historic
districtsxxi that give these neighborhoods their defining character and that comprise over
80%xxii of the rezoning area, in Chinatown and the adjacent neighborhoods. This increased
development pressure as a result of the rezoning will lead to residential and commercial
displacement, and loss of significant historic and cultural assets in some of the already
most economically challenged parts of the district.
b. The proposed increase in FAR also will permit (i) vertical expansion of buildings in
historic districts, putting great pressure on the LPC to approve such highly visible
enlargements because the zoning allows it; (ii) construction of new towers that will destroy
the best features of the existing historic neighborhood context such as the predominant
street wall, mass and scale of the buildings; and (iii) pairing with “bonus” packages such as
Elevate Transit: Zoning for Accessibility that will increase the size of buildings an
additional 20%.
c. All members of the Envision SoHo/NoHo Advisory Group agreed that the historic
character of the SoHo and NoHo Historic Districts should be preserved. The Group
48understood that historic cast-iron buildings and the legacy of an artists’ community are
what draws people to this neighborhood, and fuels an economic engine of residents,
workers and visitors. DCP did not consider this unanimous consensus of its own Advisory
Group during the rushed, irresponsible formulation of the Mayor's Plan.
d. LPC Discretion. While such increased allowances are still at the discretion of the LPC,
this increase in the zoning would send a signal to the LPC that much larger development
should be approved, and give developers a greater incentive to seek permission to
demolish. In fact, the Mayor's Plan anticipates the demolition of 73 historic architectural
resources in historic districts.xxiii
e. LPC Not Consulted. DCP has stated that they would rely on LPC review to protect the
historic districts located within the Plan Area. However, despite bringing in many city
agencies throughout the Envision SoHo/NoHo Neighborhood Plan processes, DCP has
never included the LPC as part of that public engagement.
f. Adverse Impact on Displacement. There is also significant risk of “eviction through
construction” for rent regulated and loft law tenants because of proposed as-of-right
allowances for additions to buildings that are occupied.
g. Adverse Impact on State/National Register (S/NR) of Historic Places. The rezoning
also will impact buildings in the S/NR of Historic Places including the portions of the
SoHo Historic District, Bowery Historic District, and Chinatown and Little Italy Historic
District that are outside of the impacted NYC-designated landmarked districts, the SoHo-
Cast Iron Historic District and Extension, NoHo Historic District and Extension, NoHo
East Historic District, and parts of the Sullivan-Thompson Historic District.
h. Development Rights. CB2 opposes the transfer of development rights beyond currently
permitted contiguous lots and any future proposal must maintain the contextual 85 ft. street
wall height.
5. The Mayor's Plan offers no mitigation measures for the significant adverse impacts on open
space, shadows, historic and cultural resources, transportation and construction.
a. CB2 cannot accept the DCP’s plan to mitigate1 the adverse impact on open space by
creating “additional passive open space” even though 70% of the study area population
will use active open space and the study area is better served by passive open space.xxiv
b. The DEIS acknowledges flooding in the southwest corner of the rezoning area but fails to
offer a plan to address sustainability, resilience and climate changexxv.
6. Other Concerns.
a. Virtually Unchanged Plan Ignores Input. The Mayor's Plan remains virtually unchanged
from the Draft Scope of Work (DSOW), ignoring CB2’s, Elected Officials and the
community’s constructive well-considered suggestions and criticisms – including details
from CB2’s 40-page, 16,000-word December 2020 resolution in response to the DSOW
and many responsesxxvi from stakeholders, residents and others.
b. No Chinatown Outreach. The city has failed to reach out to the many residents who will
be displaced and have been left in the dark by the mayor and DCP. The city continues to
49marginalize the residents of Chinatown by utterly failing to directly outreach to residents
of Chinatown even though 43% of the new housing development is projected in
Chinatown. For example, the City only hosted one meeting on April 30, 2019 for the
Chinatown community and only one person attended. More recently, on July 15, 2021, a
member of a family with significant property holdings in Chinatown and multiple
contiguous in the SoHo East designated opportunity zone was quoted in a major local
Chinese Daily newspaper Sing Tao Daily stating that they only recently became aware of
the proposed rezoning.
c. Failure to Share Financial Analyses. DCP has refused to share any of the financial
analyses that CB2 has repeatedly requested in response to the DSOW and the FSOW,
without which it is impossible to understand the rationale of the Mayor's Plan.
d. Insufficient Review Time. CB2 was not granted sufficient time to review the Mayor’s
Planxxvii as provided for in the 2019 Charter Revision changes overwhelmingly supported
by New York City voters.
e. Plan Underestimates Development and Mitigation. The Mayor's Plan, with only 26
Projected Sites, underestimates the actual development that will occur and thereby
underestimates required mitigations, which is supported by studies of recent City
rezonings.xxviii The DEIS ignores 58 Potential Sites because the Mayor’s Plan randomly
assumes they will be developed in years 11 to 20.
Therefore, be it resolved that Manhattan Community Board 2:
1. Rejects the Mayor’s Plan because it fails to meet its stated goals – to create affordable housing,
allow a wider range of commercial and residential uses, and support the creative community.
Instead:
a. It fails to achieve its affordable housing objectives and fails to protect against
displacement of low-income tenants, particularly Chinatown residents, seniors aging-in-
place and tenants who are rent-stabilized, rent controlled or currently only protected under
New York State Loft Law. Instead, the Mayor’s Plan must provide significantly more
affordable housing through direct city investment in 100% affordable housing
construction, adaptive reuse of existing buildings, and revise requirements that mandate far
greater numbers of affordable housing units with lower median incomes;
b. It fails to strengthen the unique mixed-use neighborhood, incentivizing commercial
development and large retail at the expense of small businesses. Eliminating retail caps
threatens small businesses and removing eating and drinking caps eliminates the
community’s voice on uses that may be incompatible with residential neighborhoods.
These changes will negatively impact the expanding residential community;
c. It fails to secure the future or consider expansion of the highly successful JLWQA use
and instead (i) proposes the eventual elimination through an ill-conceived “mechanism”
identified as an arts fund with no meaningful details, (ii) charges a punitive tax on current
residents, many of whom are legally conforming seniors aging-in-place and (iii) imposes
costly code compliance requirements as a result of the change from manufacturing to
residential use that DCP has not even considered;
50d. It fails to protect the six historic districts and buildings in the adjacent areas and in fact
encourages unprecedented encroachment of massive commercial development within
them;
e. It utterly failed to directly reach out to residents of Chinatown and include their input
even though 43% of the new housing development is projected in Chinatown. It failed to
engage with the community as promised throughout the Envision SoHo/NoHo process,
including residents, other stakeholders, our state elected officials, the Manhattan Borough
President, our local city council members and city council land use staff in the formation
of the City’s Plan;
f. It fails to mitigate the impact of the Mayor's Plan on active open space, shadows,
historic and cultural resources, transportation and construction; and,
g. It fails to modernize and preserve the governing framework for SoHo and NoHo, to
expand on the clear success achieved and does not evolve the zoning to meet the city’s
objectives.
2. Joins with tenant groups, preservationists and many highly respected organizations in SoHo,
NoHo and Chinatown and across the city (see Appendix A) in opposing the Mayor's Plan that
clearly financially benefits property owners and does not take into account the negative long-term
effects.
3. Urges the city to resume its planning process under an administration that will work in good faith
to balance the goals of those advocating for affordable housing and historic preservation, since it is
possible to do both, by specifically addressing the plan’s failures detailed above.
4. Implores our elected officials to do what DCP has refused to do – LISTEN TO THE
COMMUNITY!
Vote: Passed with 36 Board members in favor and one opposed (C. Dignes).

iv. Commercial development in the proposed M1-6/R10 areas where commercial space can be built to 10 FAR without any

Hudson Square Properties is breaking ground on a 270,000 sq. ft. speculative office development. On July 21, 2021,

this will create financial incentives for demolition, b) eliminate sites where additional FAR can only be used to add vertical

Harassment provisions before applying for a permit for a change in use or demolition as supported by the Chinatown
Working Group, Pratt Center for Community Development. Preserving Affordability & Authenticity: Recommendations

construction, neglect or harassment requires tenants to take often-unavailable time to find and consult with attorneys, take
off from work to provide testimony and attend related appointments and can take months to years to work its way through
the courts, all while the tenants and their families experience dangerous, sometimes barely livable conditions.

xxvii. In letters to DCP from CB2 on April 27, 2021, and again on April 30, 2021, CB2 raised issues with DCP and stated
that CB2 did not believe DCP was in compliance with the 2019 amendments to Uniform Land Use Review Procedure
(ULURP) provisions under the City Charter, Section 197-c, paragraph c, and asked for clarification. DCP responded to the
first letter but failed to address issues with compliance raised in the second letter, including information from the 2019
Charter Revision Commission. The Manhattan Borough President’s Office followed up with DCP following an inquiry
from CB2 requesting a response, but no written response was ever provided. On June 23rd, 2021, during a CB2 public
meeting, DCP representatives were asked about the letter. They stated that they were aware of the letter but did not explain
why no written response was provided. DCP’s lack of sincere participation in the public process of the SoHo NoHo
Neighborhood plan was noted in several public remarks made by Manhattan Borough President Brewer, Council Member
Chin and Council Member Rivera. CB2’s inquiries on DCP’s compliance with the 2019 amendments to ULURP
provisions under the City Charter, Section 197-c, paragraph c have not been resolved with CB2 or adequately addressed by
DCP, raising serious concerns regarding the ULURP process.

STANDING COMMITTEE REPORTS
LAND USE AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
1. Elevate Transit: Zoning for Accessibility (ZFA) Text Amendment: This proposal would
establish a systemwide framework for coordinating the siting and provision of transit station
easements and improvements with new developments and enlargements that would allow the MTA
to locate access to subway stations within private developments. Sponsored by DCP, Metropolitan
Transportation Authority (MTA), City Council and the Mayor’s Office for People with Disabilities
(MOPD).
Whereas:
1. The MTA and DCP are proposing a citywide text amendment that would facilitate system-wide
accessibility, with an emphasis on vertical access.
2. This action is subject to a public review process but not the ULURP process.
33. At present, only 28% of MTA transit stations are ADA accessible.
4. The proposal includes two features: a system-wide transit easement requirement and an expanded
transit improvement bonus for high density areas.
5. CB2 supports increased transit accessibility if it is accomplished quickly and relates specifically to
ADA accessibility.
6. Even though DCP does not expect the proposed action to induce development where it would not
have naturally occurred, the cumulative effect around transit stations could be transformative.
7. The lack of elevators in a majority of subway stations disenfranchises a great many people who
need to use public transit from being able to access it or who can only access it with great
difficulty.
8. The urgent need to construct subway elevators to provide this requisite ADA access has existed for
many years.
9. It is expected that elevator construction may take many years, because of MTA budget limitations.
DCP has indicated that such construction is not in the MTA current 10-year capital plan and is not
in the forefront of the next one.
The Systemwide Transit Easement Would Apply to All Stations in CB2, Man.
10. The present easement provision is a requirement for station-adjacent sites in very limited areas.
11. This text amendment would extend the easement requirement system-wide to almost every station
in the city.
12. The proposed easement provision would require developments and enlargements on lots 5,000sf
within 50’ of a mass transit station in most zoning districts to submit an application to the MTA
and the CPC Chair requesting a determination as to whether or not a transit easement volume is
required for future station access.
13. The proposed action would be offered as a new CPC Chair Certification (certified jointly by CPC
and MTA), which would be awarded prior to receiving any building permit from DOB.
14. This is the only type of non-discretionary review proposed in ZFA; it will not be referred to
community boards.
15. Where easements are provided, zoning modifications, such as a floor area exemption or a reduction
in required parking spaces (not required in CB2, Man.), would apply.
16. Zoning lots within 50’ of mass transit in the designated districts, but <5, 000sf, can apply for a
voluntary provision of an easement volume in exchange for the same zoning relief as larger sites.
Conversions would receive a targeted subset of zoning relief. Where clear paths are provided to
address sidewalk conditions, street wall relief would apply.
17. In addition, an optional Chair Certification would be created to facilitate the voluntary provision of
a transit easement on sites not subject to the requirement.
18. Applicable zoning districts include all manufacturing districts; residential districts at or above
R5D (with or without commercial overlay); commercial districts with a residential equivalent at or
above R5 districts; and C7 and C8 districts.
19. Easements can take up multiple floors (for underground, at-grade, and elevated stations) and could
be used to accommodate station needs such as elevators, staircases, passageways, or turnstiles.
20. Relief from easements can take the form of:
a. Floor area and open space: Excluding easement areas from zoning floor area; treating the
easement as a permitted obstruction (in commercial and manufacturing districts, commercial
uses on the second floor would be allowed to extend up to 30’ in height within the rear yard).
Increasing maximum lot coverage in R5, R6 and R7 districts is also an option.
4b. Height and setback: Maximum permitted height increased by 10’ for easements serving
below-grade stations in R5 and R6 districts; by 20’ for above-grade easements in R7 and
above. The portion of the street wall within 15’ of an easement would be allowed to recess up
to 15’ from the street line.
c. Use: Allowing temporary, permitted non-residential uses as well as local retail uses (UG 6) in
residential districts while waiting; allowing local retail uses within 30’ of easement areas in
residential districts; allowing greater flexibility to locate commercial uses on the second floor
and allowing second-floor commercial uses to extend into the rear yard at above-grade
stations.
d. Parking: Not applicable in CB2
e. Streetscape provisions: Excluding easement areas from ground floor use regulations and
planting requirements to facilitate station entrance design; curb cuts prohibited within 30’ of an
easement to ensure safety).
21. There is no increase in FAR with the transit easement, although an increase in height is
allowed.
The Expanded Transit Improvement Bonus in High-Density Areas (R9, R10) Would Apply to All but
Two Stations in CB2, Man.
22. The current Transit Improvement Bonus applies to the densest commercial districts (R9 and
above) in or near central business districts and offers a floor area bonus for station-adjacent
development sites that construct “major” on- or off-site station improvements. It is also
currently available in certain Special Purpose Districts. In CB2, those include the Union Square
District and the NYU 8th St. station (not the Special Hudson Square district or the Special Little
Italy District). CB2 has no central business districts.
23. This text amendment would extend the Transit Improvement Bonus to lots that are both in R9
and R10 zones and within 500’ of a station. Both conditions must be met.
24. Through a new CPC Authorization (no longer a Special Permit), the proposed text amendment
would grant a floor area bonus of up to 20% of the maximum floor area ratio permitted in the
underlying zoning and expand the improvement bonus to commercial districts of 10 FAR and
above in Manhattan (R9 and R10 districts plus their commercial equivalents, MX district
equivalents, and M1-6 districts).
25. CPC Authorizations would be referred out to community boards, but ULURP would not be
required except with additional zoning modifications.
26. The amount of floor area bonus will be “commensurate with the degree to which such
improvements enhance customer access and station environment.”
27. This would apply to any development/enlargement projects with zoning lots that are directly
adjacent to stations as well as to any zoning lots within 500’ of a station (or 1,500’ of a station
in a central business district) and provide a “significant” station improvement. “Significant”
improvements include elements like elevators, additional station entrances, mezzanine
expansions and platform upgrades.
28. A total of 121 stations in Manhattan are located within the designated distances of eligible sites.
29. Sites within 500’ of a station are also eligible to provide off-site improvements.
30. Every project to apply for the expanded transit improvement bonus would be subject to a
discretionary review process, with final approval resting with City Planning.
31. There are a few exceptions where the transit improvement bonus can be used on top of other
citywide floor area bonuses. Voluntary Inclusionary Housing projects can use the transit and
affordable housing bonuses singly or in combination. Sites that receive the transit bonus may
5be granted additional FAR on top of the maximum FAR permitted through the Mandatory
Inclusionary Housing program. For both MIH and VIH, this additional FAR is exempt from
the affordable housing requirements.
32. Maintenance of the station improvement by the developer also qualifies for a floor area bonus.
33. A developer would not be allowed to occupy and use the bonus floor area until the MTA
determines that the subway improvement is usable by the public.
Pertaining To Both the Easement and The Transit Improvement Bonus
34. Where a site providing an easement needs additional zoning modifications beyond what is
offered via Certification, additional discretionary actions in the form of an Authorization
(including, for unique circumstances, up to an additional 25% in height) or Special Permit (for
“very unique” circumstances that require >25% height increase) would be required. Other use,
bulk, parking, streetscape, and loading relief measures can be granted. Special Permits require a
full ULURP.
35. This text amendment will also create a Special Permit to address instances where a height
increase must extend beyond the 25% increase allotted in the above Authorization with the same
permitted modifications as above.
36. Both the easement and the improvement bonus are applicable in historic districts. Any
construction would be subject to LPC review and approval.
37. “Unique sites” could be provided additional relief, for example to create a transit plaza or
provide extra circulation space around a station entrance.
38. If a station is already ADA accessible, improvements can include station access and
circulation improvements such as a new entrance, escalators, more elevators, and stairs. The
MTA will determine which improvements are appropriate.
Therefore: CB2, Man. recommends approval of the ZFA text amendments with the following
conditions:
1. Any increase in FAR, height and/or bulk must be for an improvement that specifically supports
ADA accessibility.
2. No increases in height, bulk and/or FAR without a public process that includes referral to
community boards.
3. All developments or enlargements that receive an increase in floor area, bulk, height, etc. as a result
of this text amendment must be built to be 100% compliant with federal ADA standards.
4. No increases (FAR, bulk or height) should exceed 20% for any reason.
5. No combination of bonus programs (such as ZFA, VIH and MIH) should be permitted that yields
more than a combined 20% increase in FAR, bulk or height.
6. “Major” or “significant” actions resulting from required easements or bonused developments that
trigger height, bulk and/or FAR increases must be defined and quantified in the text before the
amendment is adopted.
7. Institution of a mechanism that guarantees that developers do not receive bonus FAR and then
deliver an unusable station improvement.
8. Priority should be given to swift construction of these improvements.
9. 500’ be reduced to 250’ to be eligible for the transit bonus and off-site improvements.
Vote: Unanimous, with 44 Board members in favor.
62. The Health and Fitness Text Amendment will modify regulations relating to gyms, spas,
licensed massage therapy, and other health and fitness facilities defined as Physical Culture or
Health Establishments (PCEs). The proposed text amendment will remove the requirement for
such facilities to receive a special permit by the Board of Standards and Appeals (BSA). The
proposed citywide text amendment will impact all zoning districts in New York City except R1 and
R2 district.
Whereas:
1. The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in major disruptions to gyms and fitness facilities.
2. The BSA special permit process can take more than six months and costs businesses as much as
$50,000.
3. Removal of the PCE special permit is intended to help businesses in this sector recover and
provide needed health-related amenities to communities across the city.
4. The proposed text amendment will remove the requirement for such facilities to receive a special
permit by the BSA (ZR 73-36) and add uses currently subject to this special permit to Use Groups
that are permitted in certain zoning districts.
5. It will impact every zoning district in the city except R1 and R2 districts.
6. The action will categorize all facilities dedicated to physical fitness and health occupying less than
10,000sf as Use Group 6.
7. Facilities in excess of 10,000sf will be categorized as UG 9.
8. The proposed action would distinguish between establishments containing higher intensity uses
(exercise machines, weights) that have a greater potential to generate noise vs. those with fewer
objectionable effects (yoga studios, therapy).
9. Higher intensity uses would have to verify to the Dept of Buildings prior to issuance of a
Certificate of Occupancy that the use is designed according to national standards for noise and
vibration to meet the NYC Noise Code. These additional requirements would apply to mixed-use
buildings in commercial and MX districts.
10. The only objections to PCEs that CB2 has heard in the last eight years are complaints about noise
and vibration in mixed use buildings.
Therefore, be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends approval of this text amendment with the
following conditions:
1. Verification to the DOB is via professional certification by acoustical engineer—not self-
certification.
2. Given the potential for problems in buildings with residential units, all PCEs, regardless of level of
intensity of uses, must go through the DOB process for assessing performance standards for noise,
vibration, and other quality of life concerns.
3. Hours of PCEs in residential or mixed-use buildings must be reasonably limited.
4. DEP response and enforcement mechanism must be improved.
Vote: Unanimous, with 44 Board members in favor.

SECOND LANDMARKS MEETING
7. *15 Greenwich Ave. – Application is to demolish existing 1-story commercial building and
construct a new 5-story mixed-use building with cellar and attic.
A. The existing building, a one story much altered retail space replaced a 19th century four story row
house in 1937 and is proposed to be demolished; and
B. The site is prominent, facing onto a moderately wide avenue with a park and an important historic
building, the Jefferson Market Library.
C. The building is architecturally and historically undistinguished and there is no objection to its
demolition; and
9D. The proposed new building is 20’ wide, with cellar and first commercial floors built to the lot line and
above the building steps back 27’ with four residential floors and an attic (48’ deep); and
E. The height to the roof is 62’-6” and with an unarticulated parapet and painted aluminum mechanical
equipment screen to a height of 72’
F. The facade is covered in concrete cast stone with blueish red color at the ground floor, as random
vertical elements at the windows and the overall effect is an aggressive presence in the row of warm tone
historic facades; and
G. The windows, 7’-0” high and 3’-0” wide, are single lite fixed panels with simple bronze frames with
an operable tilt panel and are far out of scale with the neighboring historic buildings; and
H. The proportion of masonry to glass gives the appearance of a modern frame with glass panels rather
than having the historic reference of punched window openings proportional to the masonry and there is
no alignment of fenestration and height to the windows in the historic tenement and row houses to the
west and the apartment building to the east; and
I. The rear facade is similar, with a simpler design and the applicant was unable to explain its visibility
from 10th Street west of Greenwich Avenue.
J. The building is an unwelcome, aggressive presence on a cohesive historic row in a prominent location
facing a park and important historic building and it is ill suited to this location on account of its scale,
proportion, height, color, materials, windows, alignment with neighboring buildings, lack of detailing and
totally lacking in historic reference; now
Therefor be it Resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:
A. Approval of the demolition of the existing undistinguished building; and
B. Denial of the application for the new construction as being an unwelcome intrusion to a cohesive
historic row in a prominent location and not having a harmonious relationship to the neighboring
buildings and the immediate area and its total lack in historic reference.
Vote: Unanimous, with 44 Board members in favor.

JOINT SCHOOLS & EDUCATION/HUMAN SERVICES
1. Resolution in Support of Mental Health Services in Schools
14Whereas:
1. Students in the New York City Public School system have undergone significant recent hardships,
the result of a global pandemic, a forced transition to remote schooling, a racial justice movement
stemming from the killings of Black Americans, rising Anti-Asian sentiment, and economic and
political instability;
2. While many families have suffered from job losses, food insecurity, racial trauma, and the death of
a loved one, they have also had to weigh the difficult decision whether to send their children back
to school or have them learn remotely at home. More than 70% of NYC public school students
15chose to learn exclusively from home and most of those who returned to buildings did so part-time
or experienced frequent classroom and building closures due to proactive COVID mitigation
strategies;
3. When schools fully reopen in the Fall of 2021, many students will be dealing with multiple
pressures, especially those who have been bereaved or experienced other trauma during this time;
4. The State Department of Health estimates that one in five New York children has a diagnosable
mental health disorder and despite this need, long before Covid-19 arrived in New York, the state
faced a chronic shortage of mental health care practitioners for children and adolescents;
5. Children in need of mental health treatment regularly sit on wait lists for months to see a therapist
or child psychiatrist. More than half of children diagnosed with mental health conditions in New
York receive no treatment or counseling at all—including 55 percent of kids with major
depression, according to data from national surveys;
6. Many public school families are priced out of mental health services, either because many mental
health professionals in the area do not accept affordable health care options or do not accept
insurance at all;
7. Since the onset of the pandemic, schools are experiencing a significant increase in the demand for
mental health services for students. Now more than ever, families need mental and behavioral
health care for their children, but significant disparities in access to this treatment continue to
exist;
8. According to the New York City Department of Education’s “Report on Guidance Counselors,” in
2018, there were 2,881 school counselors (77 of whom were part-time) and 1,335 social workers
serving the 1.1 million students in the city’s public schools. A 2017 report by the Manhattan
Borough President estimated that “Across Manhattan, there is roughly one social worker for every
800 students, and dozens of schools have not a single social worker on staff”;
9. The average delay between onset of symptoms and intervention is 8-10 years and 90% of youth
ages 10-24 that died by suicide had an underlying mental illness;
10. When students have limited social-emotional skills, they’re more likely to struggle when they face
a new challenge or conflict. Currently, Social Emotional Learning (SEL) training is not required
for educators and administrators and available only as an opt-in opportunity;
11. When SEL is combined with arts curriculum it enhances students’ capacity for Self-Awareness,
Self-Management, Social Awareness, Responsible Decision Making, and Relationship Skills;
12. Remote Learning has also provided comfort, safety and academic success for some of the families
whose children suffer from chronic illnesses, are too young to be vaccinated, are members of
communities disproportionately affected by the pandemic, have been victim to racism in schools,
and have students with learning disabilities who struggled in the traditional school environment;
Therefore Be it Resolved that CB2, Man. demands the Department of Education (DOE):
1. Hire additional social workers and train teachers on how to conduct mental health screening when
students return in Fall 2021;

https://www.manhattanbp.nyc.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/School-Mental-Health-Report-2017-Final.pdf
162. Address the inconsistent mental health support to NYC Public Schools students by introducing
additional targeted funding to enable schools to commission the support they need in this time of
crisis;
3. Establish in-school protocols that would allow students direct access to mental health providers
that offer preventative and treatment services to students and comprehensive school mental health
programs that include adequate access to school psychologists, school counselors, and school
social workers;
4. Ensure that the DOE provides ongoing culturally responsive SEL training to teachers and
administrators within required professional development;
5. Ensure that screening practices are culturally responsive so that they mitigate the traditionally
disparate treatment of Black, brown, and Asian students well-being;
6. Promote educational programs for parents and families to strengthen understanding and encourage
a supportive home environment;
7. Provide mental health services free of charge to all NYC students through their public school;
8. Allocate more resources for language access so that families with limited English proficiency will
be served adequately;
9. Provide a Remote Learning option for all families who need or want it for the entirety of the 2021-
2022 school year.
VOTE: Unanimous, with 44 Board Members in favor.

2. Resolution Demanding Immediate Support for No Offer Students --Students Who Received
No Placement at a School on their High School List, nor a Specialized High School
Whereas:
1. District 2 middle schools shared that 10% to nearly 30% of their 8th-grade students did not
receive a match to any high school on their list of schools (“No Offer Students;”), a figure that
far exceeds the 3% the city cited in a June 2, 2021, New York Post article;
2. The Department of Education (DOE) placed No Offer Students at under-enrolled schools are
located in geographic proximity to where a student lives, despite eliminating district priorities and
without any coordination with the Manhattan High School or District 2 superintendents;
3. The DOE placed many No Offer Students at high schools with programs not aligned to a student’s
interests including:
a. Transfer schools and
b. Historically struggling schools, such as Murry Bergtraum High School, which has a
current enrollment of only 129 students (down 81% since 2016) and graduates who are
29% college-ready in 2019-20;
4. The high percentage of No Offer Students greatly increases the number of families facing
significant uncertainty;
5. No Offer Students likely received low lottery numbers, which would greatly inhibit these students’
ability to receive a waitlist offer to one of their ranked schools;
Current enrollment from the NYC DOE website, five year enrollment from 2015-16 to 2019-29 using DOE Demographic Reports, capacity
from the NYC DOE Blue Book for 2019-20 (page 12) and college ready rate from the NYC DOE Quality Snapshot for 2019-20.
176. Because high school waitlists will close in mid-August 2021, No Offer Students may have a better
chance of obtaining a placement at one of their ranked high schools by exiting the DOE system
and re-entering in the future, a workaround that favors families with time and resources to
navigate the complex enrollment system and may serve to reduce equity, one of the DOE’s top
priorities;
7. MySchools, the DOE application portal, allows users to search high schools by subway, size,
sports, interest areas, eligibility (i.e. gender, new arrivals, and transfer), borough, building
accessibility, admission method, early college, career and technical education (CTE), uniform,
diversity in admissions and 10th grade admissions, but not by curricula, specifically identified
classes, or programming. It is easier to find out if a school has a baseball team or requires
uniforms than how it meets NYSED and standard college prep curricula requirement or how its
math, science or arts offerings compare to other high schools. For example, one can learn that a
school offers Spanish but it is unclear how many years it is available for students or a school
offers AP Biology but it is unclear what other non-AP science offerings are available;
8. Greater transparency will help families more easily compare high school offerings, identify high
schools that need additional resources and, ultimately, level the playing field for NYC high
schools.
Therefore Be It Resolved that CB2, Man.:
1. Demands that the Department of Education (DOE) provide greater transparency and clarity for
how students were placed at high schools and how the waitlists work;
2. Demands that the DOE immediately support No Offer Students in finding high school placements
in alignment with an individual student’s interests, including to:
a. Leave waitlists open until October 31, 2021 when the DOE finalizes enrollment
numbers for public schools;
b. Clarify Placement Options for No Offer Students Once Waitlists Close;
c. Evaluate Revising Waitlist Priorities such as moving No Offer Students to the top
of certain waitlists;
d. Provide Additional Funding and Support for Low Demand High Schools
including working with the Manhattan High School Superintendent to identify these
schools, so that these schools can provide academic, elective and CTE offerings to
attract more students to the choice system;
e. Expand Capacity at High Demand High Schools including working with the
School Construction Authority to identify existing school buildings and other real-
estate opportunities and offering Satellite campus options in the near term;
f. Promote and Market Low Demand High Schools that receive funding and
support the same way the DOE supports new schools, to attract students and
increase demand to the choice-based system;
g. Disclose Percent of No Offer Students -- the percent of 8th-grade students in
District 2, who ranked high schools, but did not receive a placement to a school on
their list nor a specialized high school offer -- and how these percentages compare to
2020 placements for District 2 and 2021 placements for the city as a whole;
h. Expand the Ability to Compare Academic, Elective and CTE Offerings on
MySchools, which will provide greater transparency and help families more easily
compare and rank high school offerings; and,
i. Establish a Helpline to answer principal, guidance counselor, parent, and student
questions and help identify alternative placement options, prioritizing the needs of
No Offer Students;
183. Insist that the DOE significantly improve the implementation of its changes to the High School
admissions process to reduce uncertainty and provide additional support for principals and
guidance counselors who advise students on the high school admissions process.
VOTE: Unanimous, with 44 Board Members in favor.

school/waitlists
3. Resolution In Support of Increased Transparency, Clarity, and Improvements to the High
School Admission Process for Fall 2022
Whereas:
1. On December 18, 2020, Mayor Bill de Blasio and Schools Chancellor Richard A. Carranza
announced changes to the middle and high school admissions process for NYC Department of
Education (DOE) public schools for the 2021-22 school year
2. Announced changes included:
a. The elimination of district priorities for Fall 2021 and all other geographic priorities to be
eliminated for Fall 2022, impacting approximately 250 high schools that have some kind
of district or geographic priority in place;
b. Keeping academic screens in place at high schools that currently use screens and requiring
schools to publish their rubric criteria on MySchools;
c. Centralizing the ranking process to “ensure equity and transparency;” and,
d. Arts high schools will move to a virtual audition system, allowing students to submit their
audition online and use one audition for all schools that require it;
3. The learning environment for the 2020-2021 school year has been far from ideal, State tests were
offered on an opt-in basis and were not offered on a remote basis and attendance records for the
2020-2021 school year have been affected by extended illnesses, quarantines, and schedule
changes;
MySchools Application Portal
4. Even choosing a small set of schools to thoroughly evaluate can be burdensome;
5. Incorrect data about course offerings and screening mechanisms appeared in the MySchools
website used by families to select schools for application;
6. MySchools, school websites, and school virtual tour presentations often presented inconsistent
information regarding high school admissions and programming;
7. The search capability of the MySchools website was unreliable, with certain successful features
(e.g. PSAL sports) but many deficiencies (e.g. Special Ed programs);
8. Response time for the MySchools website on the day that Specialized admissions closed and the
day that regular admissions opened was extremely poor;
9. Shifting information was hard to follow in English but even harder for non-English speakers;
10. Schools themselves were uncertain during the application process about admissions methodology
implemented by DOE;
11. Changes to admissions criteria were not transparently tracked;
Virtual Tours and Open Houses
12. Availability of virtual tours was inconsistent, with some schools available only in December and
others only in January or February;
1913. Some schools took a punitive approach to families desiring open houses or virtual tours,
excluding late arrivals without regard for the realities of technical difficulties or other chaos
introduced by the pandemic of 2020-2021;
14. There was no single place to check tour availability, requiring visits to multiple websites to track
new dates;
15. The new virtual open house for Arts schools was large and overwhelming;
Application Submission and Release of Results
16. Schools with supplemental application requirements set their due dates for supplemental
materials, creating confusion when system-wide due dates for applications were changed; and
17. Due dates for applications were changed and updates to websites with those due dates were
inconsistent;
18. Many families did not receive timely acknowledgment of receipt of applications or virtual
auditions;
19. Arts high school auditions submitted through the common application process were not received
by schools in some cases;
20. Students’ level of anxiety increases with each day between submission of application and release
of results;
21. Specialized High School admission results were released poorly, first with an encrypted email
that was difficult or impossible for some families to access, then unencrypted; and,
What Worked
22. Improvements have been made to the high school admission process that should continue, namely
the consolidation of the Arts audition process and the increased prevalence of virtual tours.
Therefore Be It Resolved that CB2, Man. insists that the DOE:
1. Eliminate State test scores and attendance records from admissions criteria for the 2022-2023
admissions process;
2. Release changes to admissions criteria for 2022-2023 by October 1, 2021;
Improve Data and Transparency and Centralized Access on MySchools Application Portal
3. Assist families in narrowing their choice of schools by providing information regarding the
likelihood of admission, e.g. what rank in the lottery has been required for admission in the past;
4. Ensure consistency across MySchools, school websites, and stand-alone presentations, with
immediate translation into supported languages;
5. Include an accurate date of the last update on each page of school information on the MySchools
website;
6. Special Ed and ELL support, including the number of learning specialists per grade and the
availability of a full-time special education coordinator;
a. Filter by travel time from more than one location; and,
b. Search specifically identified classes or programming rather than general text search wit
the caveat that programming may change from year to year;
Tours and Open Houses
7. Provide a single reference point on MySchools for tour dates and consistent methodology for
signup and confirmation;
8. Maximize opportunities for families to learn about schools by increasing tour capacities and
allowing for late entrance to meetings or other methods of accommodating challenging family
circumstances.
209. Make prior-year virtual tours and open houses available on school websites;
10. Revise the Arts open houses to have several shorter, more focused sessions;
Application Submission and Release of Results
11. Enhance its testing processes for application websites to ensure timely responses on the days with
most demand;
12. Create a system-wide due date for all supplemental application materials one week after the main
application deadline, extending what was done with Arts auditions this year;
13. Identify the reasons for malfunctions in the Arts audition process and make any necessary
corrections for next year;
14. Gather public opinion regarding the timeline for high school applications such as whether a
greater number of spring tours or a later application deadline would relieve pressure by allowing
research to be spread out over time or exacerbate anxiety by prolonging the process;
15. Release admissions results in a matter of weeks after the application deadline instead of months;
16. Release admissions results using tested methods such as the MySchools website rather than
through new, untested methods;
17. Minimize the parts of the high school application process that must be communicated through
secure methods while ensuring such private information is appropriately treated as such;
18. Continue to use the new consolidated method for Arts auditions and pursue further methods to
simplify the application process and offer virtual tours (including an interactive component) once
in-person tours have resumed.
VOTE: Unanimous, with 44 Board Members in favor.

264. Melvindale NY, LLC d/b/a Gjelina, 45 Bond St. 10012 (OP–Restaurant)
i. Whereas, the Applicant and the Applicant’s Attorney appeared before CB2, Manhattan’s SLA
Committee #1 to present an application to the NYS Liquor Authority for an On-Premises Liquor License
to operate a “modern upscale restaurant serving farm-to-table fare with an emphasis on season,
indigenous ingredients and the ‘whole beast’ in cellar, ground and second floors of a M1-5B-zoned, six
(6)-story commercial building (c. 1899) on Bond Street between Bowery and Lafayette Street (Block
#529/Lot #31) in the NoHo Historic District Extension; and
ii. Whereas, the premises is approximately 4,682 sq. ft. (1,700 sq. ft. ground floor, 1,200 sq. ft.
basement and 1,400 sq. ft second floor connected by an interior stairway) with 14 tables with 46 seats and
one bar with eight (8) seats and one food counter with six (6) seats on the ground floor and 22 tables with
74 seats and one (1) bar with six (6) seats on the second floor for a total of 140 interior seats; there are
two (2) bathrooms on both the ground and second floor; there is no patron use of the cellar which is used
for storage, food prep and kitchen only; and
iii. Whereas, while these premises were previously licensed as a full service restaurant for eating and
drinking in the past, albeit on the basement and ground floors only, this Applicant appeared at CB2, Man.
first in April/2016 to license the basement and ground floors resulting in a deny/unless resolution from
CB2, Man. and then again in February/2018 and December/2019 with similar principals but under
different corporations with an application expanding the licensed footprint as the Applicant was gut-
renovating the entire space while also adding the renovated second floor to the licensed premises, the
second floor not being previously operated for eating and drinking in the past, adding additional patron
capacity that did not previously exist, there being questions about whether there is a proper Certificate of
Occupancy for such use on the second floor, the applicant also planning on having operable windows
where none previously existed, that application resulting in a deny resolution by CB2, Man. and for a
number of reasons the Applicant was unable to move forward at the NYSLA with the liquor license at
both times; and
iv. Whereas, in February/2018 and December/2019 the application did not include a sidewalk café and
the applicant had previously agreed with the local neighborhood to hold off on seeking a sidewalk café
permit for one year after opening, there are no plans to further alter the front storefront façade to add
additional operable windows or doors, the windows on the second floor being operable; there is a
Certificate of Occupancy which permits eating and drinking on the basement and first floor levels only
but not on the second floor requiring a new Certificate of Occupancy and new Place of Assembly Permit;
and
v. Whereas, the proposed hours of operation are Sunday through Saturday from 8AM to 1AM, music
will be quiet background only consisting of music from iPods/CDs (i.e. no active manipulation of music –
only passive prearranged music), all doors and windows were proposed to be closed at 10PM except for
patron ingress and egress, there will be no DJs., no promoted events, no private parties, no scheduled
performances or cover fees, no velvet ropes, no movable barriers, there will be no TVs; and
vi. Whereas, there continues to be significant disagreement and opposition to the lateness of the hours
of operation proposed seeking 1AM every night midblock on a street block that has been transformed
with a number of new residential buildings built over the last decade giving the immediate area and block
a much larger and concentrated residential presence with some of those residences being on the ground
floor, the proposed restaurant being a destination restaurant not designed to support the immediate block
27and surrounding community, the other restaurants (Il Buco Vineria, Fish Cheeks and The Smile) located
on this particular block having closing hours no later than 12AM during the week and 1AM on the
weekends; and
vii. Whereas, while this same Applicant previously appeared before CB2, Man. in the April/2016
proposing later hours than the previous applicant resulting in a deny/unless resolution, the applicant did
not move forward with the prior proposal; the Applicant appearing again before CB2, Man. in
February/2018 and December/2019 presenting a new application with significant changes including
seeking to add the second floor, the increased patron occupancy and operable windows; the instant
application adding further additional interior seats, requesting operable windows open until 10PM every
night and, upon questioning about intent to participate in the Open Restaurants program, requesting to
have both sidewalk and roadbed seating consisting of approximately 20 seats on the sidewalk and
approximately 20 seats in the roadbed (the roadbed seating was increased to 35 following the CB2, Man.
SLA committee meeting) despite previously agreeing to waiting a year after opening before applying for
any sidewalk seating; and
viii. Whereas, prior to the instant application there had been ongoing opposition by the local residents
living thereat who have indicated that they would be agreeable to a restaurant at the premises albeit with
“restaurant hours” closing no later than midnight during the week, the other restaurants on the same block
being successful businesses with operating hours no later than 12AM weekdays; there being no indication
on the instant application of an intent to participate in the Open Restaurants program which will
potentially add 55 seats on the exterior or any future permanent outdoor dining program; and
ix. Whereas, this application being subject to the 500-foot rule, requiring the applicant to demonstrate
whether the public interest of the community would be served by the granting of the license, there being
49 On-Premises licenses within 750 ft. of the premises; the impact of the additional outdoor dining on the
next door and nearby residents, some of whom reside on the ground floor; and
x. Whereas, the Applicant was not willing to compromise on the lateness of his restaurant hours, the
closing of the windows—including the second floor windows—and would not commit to returning to the
community prior to filing for any permanent outdoor sidewalk and/or roadbed seating, the Applicant
having never opened the premises and therefore has not been subject to the hardship of the Covid-19
pandemic but is looking to leverage the pandemic to create outdoor seating where none previously existed
or was planned to exist; in light of this, CB2, Man. has presented stipulations for consideration below that
might conceivably allow for the creation of public interest by mitigating the impacts the issuance of this
new license might have and that represent a balance between residents and the operator; and
xi. Whereas, should the Liquor Authority consider granting this license in light of the above outlined
issues and over CB2’s recommendation of Denial, CB2, Man. respectfully requests that the following
stipulations/conditions be imposed on the license if the applicant does not otherwise agree to them:
1. The premises will be advertised and operated as a “modern upscale restaurant serving farm-to-
table fare with an emphasis on seasonal, indigenous ingredients and the ‘whole beast’” and will

15. Elmhurst 3, Inc., d/b/a The Village Tavern, 46 Bedford St. 10014 (OP – Existing Bar; Review
of Method of Operation for Exterior)
i. Whereas, the Licensee of The Village Tavern (Lic. # 1116708), Aiden Stenson, was requested to
appear before CB2, Man. after there being many complaints from people living in the surrounding
neighborhood regarding the Bar’s on-going operations; and
ii. Whereas, this Bar has operated for years as a sports bar within a single-story building at the corner
of Bedford and Leroy Streets, the Bar having closed during the Covid-19 Pandemic is now reopening as
the Pandemic is receding; and,
iii. Whereas, the Bar, which is currently permitted to be at 100% capacity on the interior, is taking
advantage of the City of New York’s “open restaurant” program and is operating on the exterior sidewalk
with tables and chairs along its frontage on Leroy Street, having also mounted large flat screen TVs on the
public sidewalk in a residentially-zoned (R-6) neighborhood; and,
iv. Whereas, long-time residents living adjacent to and across the street from the licensed bar appeared
to voice numerous quality of life problems stemming from the exterior operations of the Bar, patrons to
the bar being allowed to drink on the sidewalk, surrounding the bar, unseated, creating a bar-like
atmosphere with music being played, well past midnight, on the exterior surrounds, establishing an
unreasonable and significant intrusions on their lives; and,
v. Whereas, the Licensee and Owner of the Bar appeared and listened to the concerns of his
neighbors, having no prior experience in operating outside the licensed premise, not reading the rules

36vi. Whereas, the Licensee was unclear as to whether the TVs and music were allowed or not on the
exterior, the open restaurant’s program not providing any clarity on that subject, there being no
enforcement taking place pursuant to this program, it being suggested to the Licensee that if he simply
moved the TVs back inside the bar, patrons would simply watch the sports programing on the interior,
where it has always been; and,
vii. Whereas, to ameliorate the current problems and complaints being voiced, the Licensee agreed to 1)
close his exterior operations and alcohol service for the Bar by 10 pm Sunday through Thursday and by
11 pm on Fridays and Saturdays, and 2) that all patrons being served alcohol on the exterior will be seated
at all times and located at a table located on the sidewalk;

40TRAFFIC AND TRANSPORTATION
Resolution in response to a presentation by the NYC Dept. of Transportation (DOT) on the Hudson
Sq. W. Village long-term study re comprehensive transportation improvements.
Whereas the NYC Dept. of Transportation (DOT) presented an overview of the results of their
comprehensive transportation study of Hudson Sq. and the W. Village (study area boundaries: East-6th
Ave, Greene St., Church St.; West-West St.; North-Christopher St.; South-primary border Canal
St./secondary border Watts St., Leonard St.) along with recommendations for both early-action
improvements (2021) and longer-term improvements (2022 and beyond) and an update on implemented
improvements; and
Whereas this study was in response to requests by Community Board 2 Manhattan (CB2, Man.), Council
Speaker Corey Johnson, and the Hudson Square BID and focused largely on CB2, Man. capital and
expense budget and resolution requests. It was conducted over a period of more than three years in
conjunction and including periodic consultations with CB2, several government agencies and community
partners; and
Whereas early-action improvements were postponed because of the pandemic, but DOT is looking to
implement them this year with CB2, Man. input and approval; and
Whereas among the 10 already implemented improvements, all of which CB2, Man. welcomes, CB2 is
particularly pleased with the following that address long-time concerns that the Board has asked to be
resolved:
• Extension of protected bicycle lane on Varick St. from Clarkson St. to W. Houston St. and
provision of pedestrian islands and curb extensions from Clarkson to W. Houston St. These
measures have made the area much safer for pedestrians and bicyclists who have both reported the
improved conditions. (CB2, Man. has also suggested extending the bike lane west on Houston
from Varick to West St.)
• Installation of all-way Stop control signs at Washington & Morton Sts. This safety measure was
particularly important because of its proximity to MS297, the new middle school at 75 Morton St.
• Provision of Leading Pedestrian Interval (LPI) for north crosswalk at 6th Ave./W. 4th & Cornelia
Sts., a dangerous intersection where a bus coming from the west on W. 4th, turning north on 6th
severely injured a pedestrian crossing on 6th with the light. The extra crossing time provides
protection to be enhanced further by early-action improvements.
• Installation of new traffic signal at 7th Ave. S. & Leroy St. and a curb extension at its n.w. corner.
This long and dangerous crossing that people use, following their desire lines despite the lack of
protection, is now shortened and signalized for their safety.; and
Whereas the following recommended early-action improvements are expected to be implemented in
2021, based on CB2, Man. input and approval:
• Installation of one curb extension at the n.w. corner of Hudson & Canal Sts. intersection. This
will shorten the pedestrian crossing over Canal St.at that location.
• Remove existing painted curb extension on the n.w. corner of Canal & Varick Sts. (that creates a
difficult sharp turn for trucks) and install a new painted curb extension on the n.e. corner. Some
constituents indicated that the south Grand St. crosswalk on Varick, one block north of Canal also
is heavily used and needs higher visibility.
41• Because buses now turning left from 6th Ave. to Watts St. to reach the Holland Tunnel make a
difficult sweeping turn obstructing other vehicular and pedestrian movements, and congestion on
Watts St. causes delays, reroute buses to the Holland Tunnel via Canal St. during the weekday pm
peak period, reducing travel time by 12.4 minutes. This activity would be monitored for impacts
and possible adjustments.
• Install three curb extensions (around the n.w. and s.w. corner of Broome St. & 6th Ave. and on the
n.w. corner of Broome & Little 6th Ave.) to shorten the long crossing distance (70 ft.) on 6th
Ave., increase pedestrian circulation and channelize traffic movements.
• Revise signs that are confusing to drivers on Broome St. approaching the diverge btw. westbound
Watts St. & Broome St. at W. Broadway for greater clarity and add Peg-A-Trak markings to
improve guidance for motorists.
• Install curb extensions at 6th Ave with the intersection of Cornelia St. & W. 4th St. to provide
pedestrian crossing safety at all five corners.
• Restripe the north side of westbound Grove St. approaching W. 4th St. and provide on-street
parking (one car space) on Grove's north side btw. W. 4th St. & 7th Ave. S. to redirect traffic to
avoid the median tip on 7th Ave. S. that extends into the Grove St. travel lane making left turns
difficult and potentially colliding with vehicles. DOT has also agreed to add a height element for
visibility of the median tip, e.g. in the snow.
• Install small curb extension on the n.w. corner of 7th Ave. S. & Commerce St. to slow down the
speed of right turns through the west crosswalk that are currently facilitated by the wide turning
geometry.
• Install a new pedestrian-only phase for the west crosswalk at the Pier 40 Driveway on West St. at
Houston St. to address concerns about high volume of turning vehicles conflicting with people
walking in the west crosswalk by Hudson River Park/Pier 40. CB2 favors this improvement, but
still has concerns about vehicles turning swifty from Houston St. into the east crosswalk that
endanger pedestrians, which DOT acknowledges but observes that there's no room in the signal
cycle for adjustment and that an added light and crosswalk south of Houston may relieve crossing
demand at Houston.; and
Whereas among the longer-term improvements recommended, CB2, Man. is particularly pleased with the
proposal to extend the eastbound bicycle lane on Clarkson St. btw. Greenwich & West Sts. by
constructing a granite strip there to accommodate bicycles that now avoid the street's cobblestones by
using the sidewalk, endangering (and having injured) pedestrians. This proposal is in keeping with CB2's
own recommendation and request; and
Whereas the following longer-term improvements have also been proposed:
• To address the long pedestrian crossing distances at Charlton & Van Dam Sts. along Hudson St.,
install one curb extension at the s.e. corner of Hudson & Van Dam and two curb extensions at the
n.e. and s.e. corners at the Hudson/Charlton Sts. intersection.
• To address unmarked loading docks interfering with moving traffic and crossing pedestrians on
King St. btw. Hudson & Varick Sts., restripe King St. to separate moving traffic from the loading
area along the south curb and install curb extensions on the s.e. corner at Hudson St. and the SW
corner at Varick St.
• To address traffic and safety issues on 6th Ave. northbound btw. W. Houston & King Sts. where
vehicles coming east from King St. have difficulty accessing the 6th Ave. right turn lane to turn
east into W. Houston, reverse King St.'s direction btw. 6th Ave. & MacDougal St. and install a
new Stop control sign on the new King St. eastbound approach to MacDougal.
42• Close the median opening at Leroy and West St. where there is no crosswalk or traffic signal to
direct pedestrians toward signalized crosswalks at Morton St. (to the north) and Clarkson St. (to
the south).
• Extend the tip of Canal Park in a concrete median island on Canal St. to Greenwich St. and add
crosswalks on eastbound Canal St. east of Washington St. and on westbound Canal St. west of
Washington St. to improve the pedestrian environment by Canal Park.
• Add a new signalized pedestrian crossing midblock btw. Charlton & W. Houston Sts. for
additional pedestrian access to the Hudson River Greenway.
• To address congestion and confusion at the intersections along Broome/Watts St. approaching the
Holland Tunnel, construct concrete curb extensions along Watts St. at the n.e. corner of Varick St.
& s.e. corner of 6th Ave. (option 1) plus (opton 2) add traffic cones to streamline the traffic flow
to the tunnel.
• To improve pedestrian safety crossing Varick St. approaching the Holland Tunnel, provide
Leading Pedestrian Intervals (LPIs) along Varick at King, Charlton, Vandam and Spring Sts.;
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. thanks DOT for conducting this study in response to and
focusing on a range of CB2's transportation needs and for working in cooperation with CB2 and City and
State agency partners to develop practicable solutions; and
Be it further resolved that CB2, Man. appreciates that a great many of the improvements, whether early-
action, longer-term or implemented, are directly responsive to CB2 requests and in keeping with CB2's
recommendations; and
Be it further resolved that CB2, Man. is in favor of all the early-action improvements and looks forward
to their implementation, but asks that consideration also be given to the following:
• CB2, Man. asks that DOT consider angling the crosswalk at Grand St. across Varick St. slightly
more to the southeast in the direction of the subway station at Canal & Varick and ensure that it's
striped for high visibility (in addition to installing the curb extension at the n.e. corner on Varick at
Canal).
• CB2, Man. recognizes and appreciates that DOT will be monitoring the bus route to the Holland
Tunnel change from 6th Ave. to Canal St. and asks that DOT share with CB2 the monitoring
results and whatever impacts are discovered and adjustments that are made.
• CB2, Man. asks that DOT show CB2 the vertical element chosen to increase the visibility of the
median tip on 7th Ave. S. at Grove St. in advance of installation. CB2 also requests that DOT
consider using planters to channel traffic to avoid the 7th Ave. S. median tip instead of parking on
Grove St.'s north side btw. W. 4th St. & 7th Ave. S. and instead of striping on westbound Grove
St.'s north side approaching W. 4th St. in a future installation once the early-action diversion has
been evaluated.
• CB2, Man. is aware that at this time DOT finds it difficult to adjust signalization at Houston &
West Sts. but still has great concern about danger to pedestrians crossing in West 's east crosswalk
from swift-turning vehicles from Houston heading north and urges DOT to continue observing
conditions at that hazardous spot for potential changes (e.g. from congestion pricing) that warrant
adjustments to promote pedestrian safety there; and
Be it further resolved that concerning the proposed longer-term improvements, CB2, Man. is especially
glad to learn that the granite bicycle lane strip proposed for Clarkson St. btw. Greenwich & West Sts, can
be constructed and finished in 2022 because of new techniques; and
43Be it further resolved that CB2, Man. sees merit in many of the other proposed longer-term
improvements and looks forward to further discussions as the opportunity for their implementation comes
up, but has reservations about the following to consider:
• CB2, Man. understands that reversing King St.'s direction from east-west to west-east btw. 6th
Ave. & MacDougal St. could help avoid vehicular conflicts at 6th & King and allow for a clearer
path in the 6th Ave. right turn lane, but also recognizes that MacDougal St. forms a dead end that
could lead to extra turning movements down MacDougal and back up on the 6th Ave. right turn
lane. Additionally, this may introduce more traffic to an otherwise quiet neighborhood street. As
such, CB2 asks that DOT reconsider the reversal of the traffic flow on this block.
• CB, Man.2 is not in favor of closing the median opening at Leroy & West St. The population in
that area is increasing, especially with the advent of 550 Washington St. and an event space
nearby. CB2 encourages DOT to consider adding a signalized crosswalk at Leroy & West St.
supplementing those already in operation at Morton & Clarkson Sts. to safely accommodate the
ever-growing population and Hudson River Park users there; and
Be it finally resolved that CB2, Man. asks that as an addition to the implemented (and welcome)
extension of the protected bicycle lane on Varick St. from Clarkson St. to W. Houston St. and provision
of pedestrian islands and curb extensions from Clarkson to W. Houston St. that DOT also consider CB2's
request in its resolution adopted by the Full Board on May 23, 2019 (entitled: Resolution in response to
presentation by NYC Dept. of Transportation (DOT) on improvements planned for Varick St.: Clarkson
St./Carmine St. to King St) to install a protected bike lane on Houston St. from Varick St. to the Hudson
River by removing parking on the north side of Houston on that stretch.

STANDING COMMITTEE REPORTS
EQUITY WORKIKNG GROUP
1, Equity Surrounding Grant Money for Small Businesses
Whereas:
1. CB, Manhattan invited community leaders, CBO’s, Asian-owned businesses and members of the
Chinatown community to discuss the inequity in loan distribution intended to help small
businesses in lower-income neighborhoods and communities of color that excluded a portion of
Manhattan’s Chinatown; and
2. In November 2020, the city’s Department of Small Business Services (SBS) launched a $35
million low-to-moderate income storefront loan program. Small businesses in certain
neighborhoods could receive up to $100,000 in a zero-interest loan. The funds would provide
loans for at least 350 businesses across the city, depending on the size of loans allocated; But
some zip codes, which include neighborhoods with higher median incomes, were left out; and
3. Businesses located within the CB2, Man. section of Chinatown, including Mott, Elizabeth,
Mulberry, Baxter Streets south of Broome, Canal Street west of Bowery, the west side of the
Bowery, Bayard, Pell, Mosco, various blocks surrounding Columbus Park and Doyers Streets
3have been excluded from this crucial stimulus aid because they share the zip code 10013 with the
high-income neighborhoods of SoHo, Tribeca and NoLita; and
4. In addition to these affluent locals, the zip code 10013 includes the historic working-class core of
Chinatown; and
5. Asians are the fastest growing racial/ethnic population in New York City and comprise 15.5% of
CB21; and
6. Proportionately, New York City Asians also have the highest percentage of people living in
poverty.2
7. Even before the rest of New York City, residents, workers and businesses in Chinatown felt the
full brunt of the Covid-19 crisis including economic devastation, racial violence/bias and loss of
life; and
8. As of March 10th 2021, over 17 Chinatown restaurants and 139 ground-floor stores have
permanently closed due to the pandemic3; and
9. Business for Chinatown restaurants has dropped by 40%, amounting to a 70-80% loss in sales
since the Lunar New Year celebrations began at the end of January 20204; and
10. Popular establishments within this zip code include Kam Hing, Sweet Moment, Shanghai Heping
Restaurant, Royal Seafood Restaurant, XO Kitchen, Da Long Yi Hot Pot, YaYa Tea and The Chai
Spot that could have benefited from this loan were not given an opportunity to apply; and
11. The city’s population database shows this part of Chinatown, census tract 29, has a median
household income of ~$27,000, nearly 42% of families rely on social security and almost 47%
received food stamp benefits in the past year, yet the businesses in that part of Chinatown did not
qualify under the rules of the loan5.
Therefore, be it resolved that CB2, Man. urges the Mayor, elected officials and SBS:
1. Discontinue the use of zip codes as an indicator of need or eligibility in future relief programs; and
2. Amend the eligibility criteria for the NYC LMI Storefront Loan program to include all storefronts
located in census tracts designated as low or moderate income, so that all deserving businesses and
communities get a fair shot to apply; and
3. Incorporate eligibility and application periods for a more equitable distribution of loans/financial
assistance thereby discontinuing the use of the first come first serve approach.
4. Ensure that multilingual printed materials, i.e., press releases and informational materials are
submitted to Chinese language newspapers, television, radio and CBOs, are routinely available;
and
5. That local community organizations engage Chinatown community organizations to determine
which businesses are most in need; and
6. Enlist/Commission Chinatown CBOs like Welcome to Chinatown, Chinese American Planning
Council and the Chinatown Core Block Association to perform outreach for future grant
opportunities like the American Rescue Plan, distribute materials within the community, and equip
these organizations to offer application help.
Vote: Unanimous, 44 Board Members in favor.

42. Equitable Distribution of Vaccine in Asian Communities
Whereas:
1. CB2, Manhattan invited businesses, CBOs and members of the Asian community to discuss how
COVID-19 pandemic has affected the distribution of vaccines in Chinatown; and
2. There are no interpreters, signage or translated materials at the vaccine sites; and
3. Cheryl Wu, MD, of Amaranth Pediatrics, Yolanda Tun-Chiong, DO, of Urban Medical Group,
Amy Wu, MD, of SoHo Otolaryngology, among many other practicing physicians in Chinatown,
have applied like to be distribution sites, with no response from the city;
4. Community practices and physicians’ offices (especially those already registered with City
Immunization Registry (CIR) already have the equipment (freezers, temperature monitors,
needles), personnel (vaccinators and counselors), pipeline (hours to receive vaccines, cold chain
maintenance training), and location (office space, exam room, observation area) for vaccination
sites; and
5. People who have 100% access to vaccines (nonphysician healthcare workers), 40% of them
decline to be vaccinated; based on survey, 50% of Americans said they will decline the Covid-19
vaccine6; and
6. There is already a large discrepancy between individuals from underserved communities (Black,
Hispanic, Medicaid, impoverished, and undocumented) vaccination rates from those who are
better resourced and privileged7; and
7. Every primary care physician knows who their most vulnerable patient population is – those who
have chronic medical conditions, those who are frequently admitted to the hospital or have
significant risks for medical complications from Covid-19, and will call them to come and get the
vaccine; whereas, the current vaccination sites will NOT capture that population, and the
physicians’ offices know who they are; and
8. Patients have trust/relationship with their primary care providers and will feel more comfortable
receiving the vaccine by a trusted medical provider; and
9. Community practices and physicians already have the relationship, trust, and knowledge of their
patients to provide and counsel on vaccination.
Therefore, be it resolved that CB2, Man. implores the Governor, the Mayor and elected officials to
provide:
1. Funding to Chinatown community-based organizations (CBO’s) that provide critical translation
services for immigrant and communities; and
2. Create and institute one standard vaccine intake form available for all vaccine distribution sites
and providers citywide; and
3. Provide up-to-date informational materials, (i.e., intake forms, flyers, pamphlets, signage etc…) in
a multitude of languages and specific to the community being served at each location when
possible; and
4. Smaller vaccine sites in marginalized neighborhoods, and provide data to accurately reflect the
numbers in those communities.
5. Answer the local physicians who have said they are ready to vaccinate their patients at their
regular offices.
Vote: Unanimous, 44 Board Members in favor.

5Anti-Asian Violence & Public Safety in Chinatown
Whereas:
1. CB2, Manhattan invited Asian-owned businesses, Chinatown CBOs, residents and community
members to discuss the uptick of racialized violence against Asians; and
2. Since the start of the pandemic in early 2020, hate crimes against Asian Americans have surged
1900%. The number of incidents is now nearly 3800 between March 2020 to the beginning of
March 2021, with 503 occurring within just two months into 20218.
3. These are a fraction of the actual number of incidents that have occurred, as the majority of
incidents go unreported. For example, over 90% of the reports collected by Asian American
Federation (AAF) were not reported to either the NYPD or NYC Commission on Human Rights"";
and
4. Then former President Donald Trump deliberately used the expression “Chinese virus” more than
20 times between March 16 and March 309; and
5. The AAF says there were nearly 500 bias incidents or hate crimes in early 2020, ranging from
verbal to physical assaults, to being coughed at or spat upon, to shunning, among other forms of
discrimination10; and
6. In June of 2020, former President Trump’s use of the phrase “kung flu” — during a campaign
rally in Tulsa drew broad political backlash as a racist slur against Asian Americans11; and
7. In August 2020, The NYPD Asian Hate Crime Task Force was created when an Asian woman in
her 80s was set on fire in Brooklyn; and
8. Staffed by 25 detectives of Asian descent who speak a combined nine Asian languages, the group
is tasked with guiding victims through the justice system, from reporting a crime all the way to
prosecution; and
9. In February 2021, a man was stabbed in Chinatown, Manhattan (labeled as a hate crime due the
suspect’s history of targeting Asians); and
10. A string of shootings at three Asian businesses in the Atlanta area on March 16, 2021 left eight
people dead, including 6 women of Asian descent12; and
11. NYPD deploys extra officers to Asian American communities in response to this most recent
attack against Asians13; and
12. Asians are being targeted and singled out. Some victims do not speak English, so they are unable
to comprehend and repeat what was said to them, to justify that it was a hate crime; and
13. Many Asian-American citizens and businesses have been the victims of hate crimes created by
racist individuals — from the defacement of Chinese-owned storefronts to the physical attacks of
Asian individuals; and
14. In January 2021, President Joseph R. Biden signed an executive action condemning the racism,
xenophobia, and intolerance against the AAPI community that has become prevalent due to fear
and ignorance relating to Covid-19; and
15. Called on the Justice Department to collect data on hate crimes and harassment directed at Asian
Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI)

6Therefore, be it resolved that CB2, Man. implores the Governor, the Mayor and elected officials to:
1. Support local organizations working to fight racism within their communities, and amplifying
diverse stories and perspectives like Welcome to Chinatown, Chinese American Planning Council
and the Chinatown Core Block Association; and
2. Informing school curricula through Culturally Responsive Sustaining Education (CR-SE) about
the rise in hate and bullying against the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community,
examining the systems that perpetuate violence and hate, and finding solutions that are culturally
relevant, community centered, and trauma informed; and
3. Provide broader definition and better enforcement of what constitutes a hate crime in the law from
the NYPD, and more awareness and support of the NYPD Asian Hate Crime Task Force.
Vote: Unanimous, 44 Board Members in favor.
LAND USE AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
216 Lafayette St. (between Broome and Spring Sts.) – BSA 61-12-BZ. This application is filed
pursuant to §§72-21 and 72-23 by 101 H 216 Lafayette, LLC. The application seeks to: (i) amend the
previously granted variance permitting the conversion of a portion of the cellar and first floor of the
existing building to a Use Group 6 use to allow the expansion of the Use Group 6 use to the entire first
floor and cellar level; (ii) extend the amount of time permitted to substantially construct the plans; and
(iii) remove the 10-year renewal requirement.
Whereas:
1. The application seeks to:
a. amend the previously granted variance (referred to as the “2012 variance”) of ZR§42-
14(D)(2)(b) permitting the conversion of a portion of the cellar and first floor of the
existing building to a Use Group 6 use to allow the expansion of the UG 6 use to the entire
first floor and cellar level pursuant to ZR§11-412;
b. extend the amount of time permitted to substantially construct the plans as approved in the
2012 variance; and
c. remove the 10-year renewal requirement that was placed on the 2012 variance pursuant to
ZR §11-411.
2. The building is located in an M1-5B district where UG 6 is not permitted below the second floor
as-of-right. The total lot area is 2470sf, 25’ frontage on Lafayette and a depth of 100’.
3. The premises is a two-story plus cellar building, containing 4500sf (3243sf net once common
areas are removed), or 1.82 FAR, and is currently vacant. The maximum FAR permitted in M1-5B
is 5.0.
4. According to the 1981 Certificate of Occupancy, there were two JLWQA (UG 17 JLWQA)
dwelling units on the first and second floors with accessory storage and laundry in the cellar.
5. The most recent (2010) Certificate of Occupancy continues to show two JLWQA units (each
requiring at least one certified artist) and accessory artist studio uses on all floors.
6. Three easements currently encumber the premises:
. The 1981 Easement with 214 Lafayette and 57-59 Crosby, which grants emergency egress to
Crosby over the roof of the existing building and stipulates that no building will be built above the height
of the existing building.
a. The 1999 Easement with 214 Lafayette and 57-59 Crosby, which permits the occupants of the
premises to go in and out and receive deliveries over a strip of land behind 216 Lafayette and the south
7side of 57-59 Crosby. (Rather than being an impediment, this easement seems to be being advertised as an
asset in the marketing of the building.)
b. The 2012 Easement between 216 and 218 Lafayette, which requires an opening for access through
the party wall on both the cellar and first floor levels, in anticipation of sharing a restaurant tenant in both
buildings. This easement would permit 218 access to 216 and allow 218 to build a bathroom on the first
floor of 216. This easement expires when 218 vacates both 216 and 218 or in 2031. 218 is still operating
and therefore this easement is still in effect.
7. In May 2012, 216 Lafayette applied to BSA for a variance to permit the conversion of the
Lafayette St. front portion of the first floor to UG 6 (eating & drinking) with accessory use in the
cellar, which CB2 recommended 36-6 be denied. The applicant for the 2012 variance was Osteria
Morini at 218 Lafayette, which sought to expand its operation into 216 Lafayette: 985sf in the
cellar for storage and prep, 1265sf on the ground floor for more tables, and 1021sf on the second
floor to be used for special events and cooking classes (a total of 2250sf).
8. BSA subsequently denied expansion by Osteria Morini, but agreed to UG 6 in the front JLWQA
unit. Although the variance was granted, and a Letter of substantial Compliance was obtained in
2015 with revised plans for a restaurant, the work never commenced and the variance lapsed.
9. In September 2013, Caffe Morini & Enoteca at 216 Lafayette applied to the NYSLA for a new,
on-premise license in a previously-unlicensed location, which CB2 recommended 25-11 be
denied. The OP license was not granted, and no licensed establishment has ever operated within
216 Lafayette. The applicant subsequently dropped the request.
10. The building is one of only a few with JLWQA on the ground floor. In fact, at the time of the
2013 Variance, there was JLWQA on the ground floor rear.
11. The rear portion was occupied by a JLWQA tenant, the previous owner, until the applicant
purchased the building in 2017. They have undertaken significant demolition and construction
projects to improve certain “physical difficulties” for more than a year, such as the removal of the
wall that separated the Lafayette St. front and Crosby St. rear on all floors and the installation of
an elevator, essentially creating a single JLWQA unit taking up the entire building.
12. This work contradicts the architect’s paperwork submitted to the DOB that the building will
continue to be divided into two spaces, front and rear.
13. Given the vacancies in the JLWQA units for over two years, the pre-existing, non-conforming use
below the second floor has expired. However, it could be reinstated by either a Special Permit or
by certification by CPC.
14. The applicant argues that the rent tolerance is low, however they are advertising it for more than
$23,000 monthly. Just this past year, there was a sale of a three-story JLWQA penthouse
condominium for over $35 million within the study area.
15. Any new variance should apply the same restrictions on eating & drinking in the basement,
ground floor and/or second floor as the 2012 variance, but the applicant did not agree to exclude
eating & drinking establishments.
16. Any new variance should make it clear that the use of the rear exit is for emergency egress only
and cannot be used by 216 Lafayette St. for loading or offloading merchandise from Crosby St. or
as a potential entrance for customers.
17. It has always been CB2’s position that JLWQA should be protected.
18. This property is currently offered for sale for $14.5 million, almost double the amount paid in
2017. The listing suggests a plethora of non-restaurant, UG 6 uses:
(https://images1.cityfeet.com/d2/mKV9yqPE6SMUSV0tAekLVJLf-CDtHaJQR5e_EHF-
mfQ/document.pdf)
Therefore, be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends denial of this application based on its failure to
make the following findings:
81. A (unique physical conditions): The building has functioned very well with conforming uses
since 1928, first as an auto repair shop, later as a home to JLWQA units, and very recently as
Color House (a photography/print shop).
2. B (reasonable return): Not only are the comparative properties extremely dated, but the applicant’s
Economic Analysis uses a cap rate of 6-6.5%, which is based on a survey of lenders taken during
the third quarter of 2020—a period of unprecedented volatility and extreme market uncertainty,
bound to drive cap rates above their normal ranges. A lower cap rate in non-COVID times and
better comps would produce and a considerably different calculation without requiring a variance
to realize an equitable return on investment.
3. C (not detrimental to the character of the neighborhood or the public welfare): This is a
neighborhood with a long and strong history of arts and residential use. Loss of residential in
general, and JLWQA in particular, is per se detrimental to neighborhood character, as would be
the introduction of crowd-generating retail and restaurant uses.
4. D (self-created hardship): Given the limitations of the JLWQA uses clearly enumerated on the
most recent (1981) Certificate of Occupancy, if the applicant purchased the property envisioning
the potential of getting the variances in place to attract higher-paying tenants and/or a quick
subsequent sale, that is most certainly a self-created hardship.
5. E (the minimum variance necessary): The property was bought for $8.4 million in June 2017 and
is currently listed for sale for $14.5 million—an intended windfall by any standard, let alone in the
COVID economy. However, CB2 relies on the BSA to make that professional determination,
taking into account all of the above which we believe makes a strong case for denial.And;
Therefore, be it further resolved that CB2, Man. recommends denial of an extension of the amount of
time permitted to substantially construct the plans and removal of the 10-year renewal requirement; and
Therefore, be it finally resolved that CB2, Man. strongly recommends that at a minimum, the rear unit
be restored to active JLWQA use on the first and second floors per the Certificate of Occupancy.
Vote: Unanimous, with 44 Board members in favor.

B. The traffic barriers are composed of oxblood weathered Corten steel made into hexagonal- shaped
planters 5’-0” wide and 3’-0” high similar in appearance to existing Landmarks Commission approved
planters in the immediate area, and
C. The containers are mounted on heavy duty casters and the applicant represented that the planters are
hinged in a fashion that makes them easily movable to provide access for vehicles as required; and
D. The plantings are a combination of evergreen and annual plants and will be maintained by
MeatPacking BID; and
9E. The applicant represented that it is its intention, subject to approval from the proper agencies, to make
these open streets with the planters permanent; now
Therefore be it Resolved that CB2, Man. recommends approval of the application provided that the
design conforms to all applicable regulations of other agencies for the District.
Vote: Passed, with 43 Board members in favor, and 1 recusal (D. Raftery).
2. 439 Lafayette St. - Application is to amend a Master Plan permit for painted signs.
Whereas:
A. The amendment to an existing approved master plan seeks to modify the plan to conform to the
current regulations concerning painted wall signs in the district; and
B. The applicant provided approved designs on other buildings in the district that the sign company had
painted under the new regulations; now
Therefore be it Resolved that CB2, Man. recommends approval of the application provided that the
designs conform to the applicable regulations for the building and the district
Vote: Unanimous, with 44 Board members in favor.
3. 465 W. Broadway-Application is for a master plan to install a painted wall sign.
Whereas:
A. The design applicant presented that the permitted area of the new sign is 448 square feet (16’ x 28’),
however this size reads as too large for the visible area of the wall is positioned too low when viewed
from the street; and
B. The proposed design appears to be in conformity with the regulations for the building and the district;
now
Therefore be it resolved that:
A. CB2, Man. recommends approval of the application provided that the designs conform to the
applicable regulations for the building and the district; and
B. It is recommended that the overall size of the sign and distance between the sign and the rooftop be
reduced.
Vote: Unanimous, with 44 Board members in favor.
4. 151 Mercer St.- Application is to install a painted wall sign and light fixture at the secondary
(south) façade.
Whereas:
A. The application is for a new wall sign on a recently constructed building; and
10B. The sign is a discreet round rendering of the company logo 6’-6” in diameter and set back 2’-3” from
the front facade and appears to be in conformity with the regulations for the building and the district; and
C. A proposed LED lighting fixture incorporated into the parapet coping above the sign will draw undue
attention to the sign and is without any precedent in the district; and
D. The applicant, when questioned, could provide no precedent, historic reference, or other justification
for the lighting of the sign; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:
A. Approval of the painted sign provided that the designs conform to the applicable regulations for the
building and the district; and
B. Denial of the proposed lighting or any lighting for the sign as without precedent in the district and
visually disruptive of the neighborhood.
Vote: Unanimous, with 44 Board members in favor.
5. 58 W. 9th St. - Application is to replace 2 wood windows at the rear façade at the 4th floor with 1
single steel and glass window.
(withdrawn)
6. 484 Broome-Application is to add new entry doors, for existing retail storefronts, to provide
direct access from the sidewalk.
Whereas:
A. The present condition is two building bays with three historic windows with cast iron bulkheads in
each bay and with entrances to the ground level shops on each side of the bays in an intact ground floor of
a distinguished building typical to the district; and
B. The current condition does not permit direct entry to the two separate retail spaces and the existing
entrances are not ADA compliant; and
C. The application proposes to replace a central historic window and bulkhead in each of the two bays
with a glass infill and glass doors at ground level; and
D. The existing transom line is referenced and a plain panel of metal at the bottom of the door is intended
to reference the removed bulkhead; and
E. The proposal degrades the important, intact historic facade of a remarkably preserved building and is
not harmonious with the façade; and
F. The use of the side entrances to the retail spaces does not place an undue obstacle to entering the space
and these entrances could be made ADA accessible with less harm to the facade; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends denial of the application as an unacceptable
intrusion on an important, intact historic facade.
11Vote: Passed, with 42 Board members in favor and 2 in opposition (B. Pape, R. Sanz).
7. 37-39 Perry St. – Application is to gut renovate and re-allocate some square footage onto the roof
and modification of approved window on ground floor and extend excavation into rear yard.
Modify rear elevation.
A. The application seeks certain modification to a previously approved application for the property; and
B. The building is two individual row houses that have been united into a single house on a single tax lot;
and
C. The modification to the ground floor window previously approved is acceptable; and
D. The downspout is an architectural element which is important to the visual demarcation between the
two historically separate original houses; and
E. The rear yard excavation, provided that care is taken to protect the building and neighboring
properties, is acceptable; and
F. The proposed penthouse’s roof top elevation is 55’-0” from street level and set back 17’-0” from the
front facade and is minimally visible from any public thoroughfare; and
G. The rear facade parlor floor level has three windows instead of the original four windows and the
ground floor is a wall of divided windows and is not directly visible from any residential property; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:
A. Approval of the ground floor window, the penthouse, the rear yard excavation, and the rear facade
windows on the ground floor and recommends that the parlor floor preserve the four-window
configuration of the two original houses; and
B. That the important architectural element of the central downspout be preserved to divide the two
separate original houses rather than the non-historic impression of a four-bay wide single house.
Vote: Unanimous, with 44 Board members in favor.
8. 406 W. 13thSt. - Application is to replace existing front facade and storefront, install a rear
addition, and remediate existing roof conditions.
A. The existing condition is an undistinguished garage building occupying a lot that was originally a
Greek Revival row house; and
B. The rear addition is minimal and not visible; and
C. No structure is to be added to the roof; and
D. The proposal is for a minimal steel and glass three- bay storefront at the ground floor with a glass
facade covered by a two-story filigree brick screen on the upper floors; and
12E. The glass storefront has no reference to the historic appearance of the district and does not reference
the original row houses or the garage entrance of the present building; and
F. The filigree brick screen has no reference or precedent to any building in the district and is visually
completely unsupported giving the impression of a floating brick screen; and
G. The entire facade is out of place in the district and an unwelcome intrusion to the streetscape; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends denial of the application or any modification of
the design that a screen of any kind and is totally without historic reference.
Vote: Unanimous, with 44 Board members in favor.

13JOINT REOPENING WORKING GROUP/TRAFFIC & TRANSPORTATION
Resolution in support of the Meatpacking Business Improvement District (“Meatpacking BID”)
Pedestrian Oriented District (“POD”): Enhanced Open Streets Restaurants (“OSR”) and Open
Streets Program
Whereas
State of the Open Streets Restaurants Program: Temporary and Permanent
1. Mayoral Executive Order No. 15314 and City Council Int 2127-202015 set the expiration of the
City’s current outdoor dining program to September 30, 2021 (self-certified, temporary sidewalk
seating and self-certified roadway seating), and set the replacement of the current outdoor dining
program with a permanent program allowing for the use of roadway seating as outdoor dining
areas;
2. The City’s guidelines for the permanent outdoor dining program, allowing for the permanent use
of roadway seating as outdoor dining areas, have not been established;
Key Learnings from the Open Streets Program
3. Open Streets are not successful unless they are actively managed, and when Open Streets lack
management it leads to drivers disregarding barriers and/or speeding down an open street,
endangering pedestrians and those dining outside;
Meatpacking BID’s History with the Current DOT Open Streets Restaurants and Open Streets
Programs:
4. The Meatpacking BID is a DOT partner in the current Open Streets and Open Streets Restaurants
(OSR) programs (with three existing street closures in CB2 and one street closure outside the
district) and the BID intends to include these streets as part of their proposed Enhanced Open
Streets Restaurants and Open Streets Programs:
a. Gansevoort Street from Ninth Avenue to Washington Street (CB2)
b. West 13th Street from Ninth Avenue to Washington Street (CB2)
c. Little West 12th Street from Ninth Avenue to Washington Street (CB2)
d. Ninth Avenue (Westernmost lanes) from West 15th Street to West 14th Street (CB4);
5. The Meatpacking BID currently employs both a sanitation crew and a public safety crew that
handle the opening/closure of the French barricades (Meatpacking BID Sanitation Crew) and
monitoring of the Open Streets (Meatpacking BID Public Safety Crew). The BID plans to expand
the level of monitoring service provided by engaging a more pedestrian-management-focused
contractor;
Introduction of the Meatpacking BID’s Enhanced Open Streets Restaurants and Open Streets
Programs
6. The Meatpacking BID’s plan for a Pedestrian Oriented District: Enhanced Open Streets
Restaurants and Open Streets Program offers an excellent opportunity to provide a safe, attractive,
vibrant and less traffic-congested environment that serves businesses, residents and visitors in the

14community, while also evaluating and improving features as they are in use and acting as a pilot
program from which certain aspects may serve as examples of potential for betterment to other
communities;
Key Points from the Meatpacking BID’s Enhanced Open Streets Restaurants and Open Streets
Program
7. The Meatpacking BID is working with DOT to get a past CB2 request16 implemented, which is to
reverse the traffic on 13th Street at Ninth Avenue, creating an eastbound traffic flow on 13th Street
from Ninth Avenue to Eighth Avenue;
8. In addition to the current Open Streets listed in No. 4 above for inclusion in the Meatpacking
BID’s Enhanced Open Streets Restaurants and Open Streets Programs, the following street
closures were introduced and identified as “Potential OSR block” closures (see the “i.e.” in the
parentheses below and the yellow lines in the map below), however, at this time the Meatpacking
BID does not necessarily intend to close these streets:
a. West 13th Street from Washington Street to 10th Avenue (i.e., closure of West 13th from 9th
Avenue to 10th Avenue) (CB2)
b. Little West 12th from Washington Street to 10th Avenue to (i.e., closure of Little West 12th
Street from 9th Avenue to 10th Avenue) (CB2)
c. Gansevoort Street from Washington Street to 10th Avenue and Gansevoort from Hudson
Street to Ninth Avenue / Greenwich Street (i.e., closure of Gansevoort from Hudson to 10th
Avenue) (CB2)
d. West 15th Street from 9th Avenue to 10th Avenue (which will potentially direct more cars
into CB2 via Hudson) (CB4)

15Meatpacking District Map: Exhibit A
The green lines on the map are also the current streets that the Meatpacking BID has managed and
continues to manage under the current DOT Open Streets Restaurants and Open Streets Program.
Traffic and For-Hire Vehicles
9. Comprehensive traffic studies have long been a part of potential material changes to the
Meatpacking District as evidenced by CB2 resolutions in October 2006, November 2006, July
2007, February 2008, and February 2009 (See Appendix);
10. The traffic study provided in the February 24, 2021 presentation was completed in July 2020
during the Covid-19 lockdown and while the results correlated to a study done a few years ago in
terms of types of vehicles in the District during different times of the day it is not an accurate
representation of the impacts of these street closures on the anticipated traffic and pedestrian flow
once the State of New York’s quarantine is lifted and there is a return of tourists to the District;
11. Concerns have been voiced about the diversion of vehicular traffic – with the closure of the
current Open Streets (No. 4) and the Proposed OSR blocks (No. 8) – to adjacent neighborhood
streets and the need for dropoff/pickup locations to prevent vehicular entry that can't be
accommodated with the new street pattern and would cause congestion;
12. The Meatpacking BID is actively in talks with Lyft and plans to connect with Uber in aligning
these for-hire-vehicle (FHV) apps with a designated dropoff/pickup point for drivers on the
respective platforms, and while this will address some of the for-hire vehicles, it will not
necessarily work in diverting yellow cabs;
1613. 14th Street is now an Express Busway between 9th Avenue and 3rd Avenue, which means that
between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m., only buses and trucks have been allowed to make trips between 9th
and 3rd Avenues, with all other vehicles limited to staying on the street only until the next right
turn. If approaching from the north on 9th Avenue, turning west onto 14th Street is prohibited;
Barriers
14. Given that the Meatpacking BID is wholly in the Gansevoort Historic District and partially in the
Greenwich Village Historic District, the aesthetics and materials of the proposed hexagonal
barriers will be reviewed by the CB2 Landmarks Committee on Thursday, March 11, 2021, and
are not part of this resolution;
Seating Accessibility
15. While specific seating options for the proposed Pedestrian Oriented District were not part of the
Meatpacking BID’s presentation17, there are seats illustrated in the background of renderings on
page 7 in the presentation which show seats similar to what the BID uses now (i.e., seats with
backs) as well as low, backless seating with planters on pages 3 and 13. There was not an
indication that the BID would be adding additional seating to the POD. It was communicated to
the Meatpacking BID that if any additional seating is planned in the future, that the seats should
have backs and generally be taller in height to accommodate anyone with physical challenges,
such as older people and those with disabilities;
16. It is understood that the tables and table seating on the sidewalks and in the roadbeds used
exclusively for table service by restaurant operators are provided solely for the exclusive use of
those restaurants under the Open Restaurants program for sidewalk and roadbed dining and are not
part of this proposal;
Area Considerations
17. One block south of the Meatpacking District is a highly populated residentially-zoned area with
narrow streets and no stop lights, an area that has absorbed many of the negative impacts of the
destination area that the Meatpacking District became before the pandemic;
18. While this residential area is outside the boundaries of the Meatpacking BID, residents spoke out
in favor of the proposed street closures so long as the Meatpacking BID makes a concerted effort
to proactively protect the quality of life of residents of this area including traffic impacts and work
with them for the duration Enhanced Open Streets Restaurants and Open Streets Programs;
19. The following venues are anticipated to have a material impact on the pedestrian and traffic flow
in the Meatpacking District:
a. One new hotel opening in the area: Restoration Hardware Hotel on Gansevoort Street
between 9th Avenue and Washington Street (anticipated to open Fall 2021/ Early 2022).
This brings the total number of hotels in a concentrated 6-block area to four (4)
(Gansevoort Hotel, The Standard, Soho House (Member Club & Hotel) and the still being
constructed Restoration Hardware Hotel);
b. City Winery (Hudson River Park Pier 57 between 14th and 15th Streets) opened October
2020. The roof will be a large landscaped public park and will host Tribeca Film Festival
17 Meatpacking BID Presentation of proposed Pedestrian Oriented District: Enhanced Open Streets Restaurants and Open Streets Programs,
February 24, 2021: https://cbmanhattan.cityofnewyork.us/cb2/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/EnhancedOSR_CB2_sml.pdf
17June 2021 and the ground floor will have a public marketplace and restaurant, indoor and
outdoor seating areas. Expansion of Google offices at Pier 57;
c. 60-74 Gansevoort Street – Match Group (Tinder, Hinge parent company) new
headquarters;
d. Little Island (Hudson River Park Pier 55 between 14th and 13th Streets) is anticipated to
open at the end of Spring 2021 including a crosswalk opening at 13th Street. The roof will
be a large landscaped public park and will host Tribeca Film Festival June 2021;
e. Gansevoort Peninsula (Hudson River Park Pier 52 between Gansevoort and
Little West 12th Street), which is slated to open Spring 2023;
f. The Whitney’s David Hammons Day’s End sculpture opening May 2021 at the southern
end of Gansevoort Peninsula;
g. Hyundai / Genesis event space, restaurant and car showroom at 40 10th Avenue (corner of
13th Street);
20. Unusual to other parts of the City, there is no way out of the District for vehicles going north until
they reach 10th Avenue at 14th Street, and the only way one gets there in a vehicle from the District
is by transiting north on 9th Avenue to a very congested, highly pedestrianized intersection at 14th
Street where all vehicles are required to turn westbound. This is why it is critical to reverse the
traffic on 13th Street to eastbound on 13th Street from 9th Avenue to 8th Avenue;
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. supports the Meatpacking BID’s Enhanced Open Streets
Restaurants and Open Streets Programs, as recommended by CB2 above and agreed to by the
Meatpacking BID, as a one-year Demonstration Project of the proposed plan that will act as a pilot to test
the above-described proposed application and make modifications where necessary, while observing how
this works in all seasons, in particular as tourists and visitors return to the Meatpacking District post-
Covid;
Be it further resolved
Reporting on Demonstration Project
1. CB2, Man. asks the Meatpacking BID to present to the Board in six months, giving updates on the
operations and experience of the Pedestrian Oriented District and Enhanced Open Streets Program
including the usage, improvements, modifications, challenges, reception, etc., and following that,
present again to the Board in six-month intervals thereafter, including a comprehensive review at
the end of the one-year Demonstration Project, which should be prior to the Spring 2022 season;
Closing of Potential OSR Blocks
2. Prior to closing any of the Potential OSR Blocks, the Meatpacking BID should present a traffic
analysis showing impacts of any Potential OSR block closures on the immediate Meatpacking
BID area and the residential area to the south. The Potential OSR block closures are listed directly
and are designated by yellow lines on the map in No. 8:
a. West 13th from 10th Avenue to Washington Street;
b. West 13th from 9th Avenue to Hudson Street;
c. Little West 12th from 10th Avenue to Washington Street;
d. Gansevoort Street from 10th Avenue to Washington Street;
18e. Gansevoort Street from Greenwich Street to Hudson Street;
f. West 15th from 10th Avenue to 9th Avenue (while not located in CB2, the impact of this
closure affects entry and exit into the Meatpacking District);
Traffic and For-Hire Vehicles
3. CB2, Man. requests that the Potential OSR blocks (No. 8) are studied with the results of these
closures presented as part of the two (2) six-month updates requested above i.e. studied on
days/evenings when there are multiple events happening simultaneously at different venues listed
in Area Considerations (No.17-20);
4. CB2, Man. urges that specific locations for drop-off/pickup spots and taxi/FHV stands be
established at key points outside the area of central activity to discourage vehicular entry while
allowing for convenient walking access;
5. CB2, Man. recommends that once locations for drop-off/pickup spots and taxi/FHV stands have
been selected that the Meatpacking BID work to encourage its member businesses (venues and
restaurants) to acquaint their customers with the selected drop-off/pickup spots and encourage
their use via a PR campaign;
6. CB2, Man. continues to support its recommendation from February 200918 that DOT reverse the
traffic on 13th Street at Ninth Avenue which would create an eastbound traffic flow on 13th Street
from Ninth Avenue to Eighth Avenue, adding speed humps, if necessary, to control traffic speed
by the school;
Barriers
7. CB2, Man. strongly supports the BID’s plans to expand the level of monitoring service to ensure
regular attention to both monitoring activity and opening and closing needs;
Area Considerations
8. CB2, Man. strongly recommends that the Meatpacking BID work in concert with the residential
neighbors directly south of the District in mitigating potential issues during the implementation of
the program to ensure it is a success for all who are impacted.

SCHOOLS AND EDUCATION
1. Resolution In Support of Ensuring the Bleecker School is Built:An Option Worth $65 Million
to NYC Taxpayers
Whereas:
1. To ensure that the Department of Education retains its $65 million option to build the Bleecker
School -- a 100,000 sq. ft., K-8 public school on New York University-owned land -- the DOE must
either fund the school before the option expires on December 31, 2021 or extend the option date;
a. The Bleecker School was NYU’s key community giveback as part of its 2012 rezoning;
b. If the Bleecker School option expires on December 31, 2021, $65+ million in value
transfers from NYC taxpayers to NYU, based on the average price per buildable square foot in
Manhattan and arguably higher due to the lack of vacant land in Greenwich Village;
c. From 2014 to 2020, CB2, Man. has passed six resolutions in support of funding and building the
Bleecker School, including our September 2019 resolution: Dyslexia Education: A Critical Equity
Issue for NYC Students – in support of 1) implementation of early screening, curriculum
development, teacher training, programs and schools to support and teach children with dyslexia
in NYC public schools and 2) the creation of a DOE public school program for dyslexic students
at the Bleecker School Site and our July 2020 resolution: In Support of New York University and
Trinity Real Estate Commitments to NYC for the Bleecker School and Hudson Square School and
Public Recreation Space;
d. In December 2019, downtown elected officials sent a letter to the DOE in support of exploring the
“possibility of creating a DOE public school program for dyslexic students” at the Bleecker
School site;
2. The DOE Capital Plan released in November 2019 and February 2020 included language that the
DOE “intends to exercise” its option;
3. Covid-19 has caused 30,406 deaths in New York City since February 29, 2020, the date of the
city’s first confirmed Covid-19 case and on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared
Covid-19 a global pandemic;
4. In February 2021, the DOE Capital Plan included revised language that “the DOE has been
working with NYU to extend the period to exercise the option to develop a school at Bleecker Street and
LaGuardia Place;” and,
For additional details, view bit.ly/Bleecker FAQ
205. On March 11, 2020, President Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan or Covid-19
Stimulus Package, a $1.9 trillion economic stimulus plan, which will provide billions of dollars of support
for NYC public schools.
Therefore, be it Resolved that CB2, Man.:
1. Urges our elected officials, New York University and the Department of Education, along with
CB 2, to reconvene the Bleecker School Task Force to ensure that the city is able to exercise the Bleecker
School option by either funding the Bleecker School or reinstating the School Election Notice to 2025, the
date NYU originally promised in its 2012 rezoning; and,
2. Continues to support that when the Bleecker School is funded and built that it serves the
educational needs of our community, with particular focus on the possibility of developing a school to
serve students with dyslexia and other language-based learning disabilities.
VOTE: Passed, with 43 Board Members in favor, and 1 abstention (M. Fitzgerald).

2. Resolution in Support of an Additional Opportunity for Fully Remote Students to Switch to
In-Person Learning
Whereas:
1. By Monday, March 22, 2021, all NYC Department of Education (DOE) public schools will be
open for hybrid learning;
2. By early April, the Public School Athletic League will resume for practices and conditioning, with
competition beginning in May for all high school students, including those who have opted for fully
remote learning;
3. Families who initially elected fully remote learning have not had the opportunity to return to
hybrid since November 13, prior to Thanksgiving, Winter Break and the winter cold and flu season; and,
4. Attending school in-person is optimal for the social-emotional and academic development for
some (but not all) students, subject to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s guidelines for
operating schools during Covid-19, updated February 11, 2021.
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. insists that the DOE provide the one additional opportunity for
fully remote students to switch to in-person learning for the remainder of the 2020-2021 school year and

3. Bleecker Street Bar Corp. d/b/a Bleecker Street Bar, 648 Broadway 10012 (New OP –
Bar/Tavern)
i. Whereas, the Applicant and the Applicant’s Attorney appeared before CB2, Manhattan’s SLA
Committees #1 & #2 to present an application to the NYS Liquor Authority for the removal of an On-
Premises Liquor License (Lic. # 1025041, exp 10/31/2021) from 58 Bleecker Street and a new On-
Premises Liquor License to open and operate a neighborhood bar/tavern at 648 Broadway in an M1-5B
zoned, 12-story, mixed-use building (c. 1900) on Broadway between Bleecker and Bond Streets (Block
#529/Lot #3); and
ii. Whereas, the storefront is approximately 5,000 sq. ft., comprised of a ground floor of 2,500 sq. ft.
connected by an interior staircase (for use by employees only) to a cellar of approximately 2,500 sq. ft.,
which will be used for kitchen and storage purposes only; the space will have approximately 20 tables
with 94 seats and one (1) stand-up bar with 24 seats with additional patron seating around the front
counter and rear pool tables and dart board for a total occupancy of approximately 150 seats and overall
patron occupancy of not more than 180 persons; and
iii. Whereas, the Applicant seeks to remove the license from the bar/tavern which they have owned and
operated at 56-58 Bleecker Street and move around the corner to 648 Broadway (285 ft. away); the
applicant operated at that location for over 30 years until August 2020 without stipulated hours and was
often open until 4:00 AM and has been a long-standing, locally owned business and part of the NoHo
neighborhood for over three (3) decades; and
iv. Whereas, when questioned about the Applicant’s prior location and the reasons they sought to
move to this new location, the Applicant explained that with the COVID-19 restrictions, new
circumstances and other changes it was impossible for them to meet the rent requirements at their
Bleecker St. location and that this new location around the corner was chosen because of its proximity to
their prior location allowing them to remain in the same immediate neighborhood, in addition to the
landlord of the new building and applicant having worked out a financially feasible leasing arrangement;
and
v. Whereas, the storefront location of the instant application at 648 Broadway is located in a 10-story
building with one residential unit on the eighth floor, the ground floor having operated as a retail store
from 2009–2011, thereafter as a deli/café with buffet style service operating with a Restaurant Wine
25license from approximately 2011 to 2014, was mostly vacant in 2014 with a pop up retail store during
Halloween, followed by a pop up, month-to-month clothing retail store (2015–2019) before being vacant
since mid-2019; the immediate area of several blocks on Broadway have had a higher vacancy rate than
the Broadway corridor in SoHo to the south; this location is located within NoHo which is zoned as a
manufacturing district (zoning M1-5B) which prohibits this use as of right on the ground floor or eating
and drinking establishments larger than 5,000 sq. ft., but the landlord had sought and received a special
permit to operate a retail space on the ground floor and basement in 1992 as allowed and provided for
under the current zoning act; the zoning across the street on Broadway is commercial (C6-2) which allows
eating and drinking establishments as of right; and
vi. Whereas, the Applicant first appeared before CB2 Man.’s SLA Committee in January/2021 seeking
an On-Premises License with 4:00 AM closing hours seven (7) days a week, consistent with their license
at their location at 58 Bleecker St. that they are seeking to move; CB2 received correspondence and heard
testimony from residents living in the immediate area both in favor and in opposition to the licensing of
these premises, some residents opposed being directly impacted and living in the building immediately
adjacent to the premises proposed to be licensed; a NoHo Bowery Stakeholders representative also
appeared at the meeting requesting a number of concessions from the Applicant including a reduction in
hours and many stipulations which protect the quality of life of immediate surrounding neighbors; it being
apparent to CB2 and there being a request by the Applicant to lay the instant application over in an effort
to work with representatives from adjacent buildings and a representative of the NoHo Bowery
Stakeholders on a stipulations agreement and to better understand where there was and was not agreement
in the proposed method of operation at the new location; and
vii. Whereas, the Applicant appeared at CB2 Man.’s SLA Committee in February 2021 to present an
update on furthering discussions with adjacent building representatives and a representative of the NoHo
Bowery Stakeholders and again requested to lay the instant application over while they continued
discussions with area residents, it becoming apparent that most issues were agreed upon except two
critical areas — hours of operation and overall occupancy; and
viii. Whereas, during this month’s March CB2, Man.’s SLA Committee meeting, the NoHo Bowery
Stakeholders forwarded and presented a memorandum summarizing and outlining the results of the more
than six (6) calls/meetings the Applicant held with concerned resident/owners and indicating the areas
where there was and was not agreement regarding the terms of the instant application; this memorandum
illustrating that the hours of operation with a 4:00 AM closing time seven (7) days a week and a desired
patron capacity of over 200 were the remaining overriding concerns; and
ix. Whereas, residents of the immediate area also appeared and wrote CB2, Man. both in favor and
against the instant application, including the Presidents or representatives of two large co-op buildings
located across the street and a building with 14 units next door to the location who both wrote in
opposition; and
x. Whereas, issues that were raised by those in opposition to the application included that the location
had not been previously licensed, that this area on Broadway was substantively different than the previous
area 280 ft. away on the corner of Crosby St. and Bleecker St., that this location on Broadway was
overwhelmingly residential in character despite it being a commercial district; that, while it appeared that
this operator had no violations or known complaints, their patrons were responsible for public urination
and vomiting along Crosby Street and regular rowdy late night behavior, notwithstanding the issues with
homeless encampments, there were concerns of late-night noise on Broadway as a result of patrons
smoking outside and coming and going, the building immediately next door being in opposition to a bar at
this location regardless of hours or patron capacity; and
26xi. Whereas, some Committee Members from CB2 Man.’s SLA Committee questioned the 4:00 AM
closing time from Thursdays to Saturdays in light of the opposition presented by those directly impacted
by the Bar being relocated to a location that has not previously had an On-Premises License, those
Committee Members suggesting the better alternative would be for a 2:00 AM closing during these same
nights; and
xii. Whereas, issues raised by those in support included that this establishment has been part of the
fabric of the community and part of the identity of NoHo for 30 years, that moving 280 feet around the
corner to Broadway was appropriate and would allow them to continue as part of the neighborhood, that
the principles were highly experienced and that they had a security firm that they had worked with for
many years, that this location was first and foremost a neighborhood bar and operated as such, that the
dart leagues and pool leagues were unique in the area at this point, most other similar establishments
having long vacated the area; many found the late-night hours favorable and expressed that this business
specifically was one of the few long-standing late-night neighborhood bars that actually serviced the local
community and very specifically some local 2nd shift workers; and
xiii. Whereas, the applicant provided compelling testimony including a team of principles with many
years of experience and the ability to responsibly operate the establishment at later hours as evidenced by
having no official complaints while being known as a late-night neighborhood bar, often with a regular
group of locals and local 2nd shift workers; it should be pointed out many proclaim they will become this
type of establishment without evidence, the applicant having operated this same business around the
corner for 30 years; and
xiv. Whereas, after discussion and to meet concerns of the committee and residents, the application
being subject to the public interest standard of the 500 foot rule, the applicant agreed to stipulate to reduce
the proposed hours of operation for the instant application to 11:00AM to 2:00 AM Sundays through
Wednesdays and 11:00 AM to 4:00 AM Thursdays through Saturdays; and was specifically willing to
limit overall patron occupancy to not more than 180 persons exclusive of staff; the premises will have
approximately 20 tables with 94 seats and one (1) stand-up bar with 24 seats with additional patron
seating around the front counter and rear pool tables and dart boards; and

7. The Spot Barbershop Bond & Bowery, LLC d/b/a The Spot, 332 Bowery 10012 (New OP –
Previously Unlicensed Location)
i. Whereas, the Applicant’s Attorney and Applicant’s General Counsel appeared before CB2,
Manhattan’s SLA Licensing committee to present an application to the Liquor Authority for a new On-
Premises Liquor License to operate a barber shop in a ground floor storefront located in a four story brick
townhouse building (circa 1915) on Bowery between Bond and Great Jones Streets in NoHo; and,
ii. Whereas, this storefront was operated for years as various retail stores, the most recent being the
flagship store for Burkelman, a retailer selling lifestyle products for the home, this particular location
having never been licensed for the service of alcohol or for eating and drinking, the Applicant presenting
a certificate of occupancy allowing for a store, use group 6; and
34iii. Whereas, the ground floor storefront is roughly 2,200 sq. ft., there is no kitchen or food prep venue,
there is a basement but the existence of the lower level basement space was not initially disclosed on the
submitted questionnaire, the square footage for the basement not being provided, at the front portion of
the premises there will be a full-service bar open to the public serving an assortment of high-end drinks
(rum, vodka, whisky, gin), wine and beer products with nine (9) seats, food service will be minimal,
described as “snacks”, in addition to one bathroom and twelve haircutting stations in the rear space
separated by a fixed full barrier with rolling door; local health regulations prohibit the consumption of
food or beverages in areas specifically designated to cut hair including prohibiting patrons from being
served food or drink while seated in barber chairs and having their hair cut; and
iv. Whereas, the hours of operation will be Sunday through Saturday from 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM, there
will be two TVs, music being at background levels only, there being no exterior areas for the service of
alcohol, no promoted events, no scheduled performances or cover fees; and
v. Whereas, there was opposition from the Community to this application, the NoHo Bowery
Stakeholders, representing 25 individuals and 38 residents/owners contiguous to this storefront address, to
the granting of a full liquor license at this location, concerned that after a license is granted at this location
it will pave the way for another late-night drinking establishment at the location in the future, citing the
growth of liquor licenses in this area and the excessive saturation of existing liquor license
establishments, the adjacent storefront to this location having only recently obtained a new On-Premises
license for the very first time in 2019, a search of the area on the NYSLA mapping system demonstrating
59 active On-Premises Liquor Licenses with a 750-foot radius and as many as 200 within a 1,500 sq. ft.-
radius of this particular storefront; and
vi. Whereas, this application being subject to the 500 foot rule requiring the Applicant to satisfy the
public interest standard for adding another licensed establishment in this area, the area already being
saturated with licensed establishments, there being questions raised about the appropriateness of the full
service bar, serving mixed drinks and hard spirits in a barbershop, the Applicant not willing to consider,
in the alternative, a beer and wine license instead of full service liquor; and
vii. Whereas, the Applicant operates other barbershops in Miami, Florida where the service of alcohol
is provided complimentary to guests and local laws allow the service of drinks to customers while they
are seated in barber chairs and do not require separations into two areas, the Applicant’s CEO being
quoted in a news article promoting their expansion and franchising efforts in other cities, including
SoHo/NoHo, where it plans to open “an exclusive 2,400 sq. ft. two-story shop with a private cellar
directly beneath it…[which will] be transformed into a private lounge and club for members to congregate
while enjoying premium spirits”, the Applicant’s attorney when confronted with this news article
acknowledging the unidentified basement space to the instant storefront at 332 Bowery but denying that
the basement was a part of their application at this time; and
viii. Whereas, while the concept of a barbershop with complimentary drinks is not the primary objection
being raised by this application, there being no known license in NYS that can provide for the service of
distilled spirits in a hair solon or barbershop in the manner requested here, even though it is
acknowledged that a complementary drink, alcoholic or non-alcoholic, is often provided at hair salons
and/or barber shops, albeit done without a liquor license; rather it is the requirement being presented here
that the barber shop also operate as a full-service bar serving distilled spirits that is objectionable, when a
beer and wine license would be more appropriate and reasonably provides for a similar experience as
what is being sought in this application, and would not be subject to the 500 foot standard which must be
met before the issuance of the license, a standard that was implemented to limit the impact of such
licensing in an urban setting as currently exists here; and
35THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that CB2, Man. recommends denial of the alteration application for
the existing On-Premises License for The Spot Barbershop Bond & Bowery LLC d/b/a The Spot, 332
Bowery 10012; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that should this application be considered by the SLA, CB2, Manhattan
respectfully requests that this item be calendared to appear before the Full Board of the SLA.
THEREFORE, BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that if this application is considered by the SLA,
despite CB2, Manhattan’s recommendation to deny this application, CB2 requests that the SLA conduct a
500-foot hearing.
Vote: Passed, with 37 Board members in favor, 5 in opposition (J. Kiely, M. Metzger, B. Pape, S. Russo,
R. Sanz) and 2 abstentions (D. Gruber, A. Zeldin).

LAND USE & PUBLIC DEVELOPMENT
New York City Council Intro 2186-2020: A local law to amend the New York City charter, in
relation to requiring a comprehensive long-term plan. This bill would create a ten-year comprehensive
planning cycle connecting budget, land use, and strategic planning processes. The cycle would include a
review of City conditions, including racial and socio-economic disparities, access to opportunity,
displacement risk, short- and long- term risks, impacts of prior development and budget decisions, and
current and projected infrastructure needs. A Citywide Goals Statement would set targets for housing,
jobs, open space, resiliency infrastructure, City facilities, schools, transportation, public utilities, and other
infrastructure.
Whereas:
1. On December 16th, 2020, with little publicity and no circulation to the public or community
boards, New York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson released a document entitled Planning
Together: A New Comprehensive Planning Framework for New York City, followed by Bill
2186-2020, introduced in the City Council on December 17, 2020.
2. This bill is now being fast-tracked to the February 23, 2021 meeting of City Council Committee
on Government Operations, to be voted on by the City Council as early as March, with insufficient
input at the community-board level—especially in light of the need to continue with Zoom-only
meetings.
3. This is in stark contrast to the lengthy educational process undertaken by the 2019 Charter
Revision Commission, whose slogan was “You Can Vote On That.”
4. Adoption of the long-term comprehensive plan as it is now written would result in major changes
to the public review process that are not fully understood at this time.
5. This would add a completely new layer of bureaucracy to a city that is already facing severe and
unprecedented budget constraints.
6. Implementation would require resources—both economic and staff—that community boards do
not currently have, in order for them to be able to participate in this complex and lengthy process.
4Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. strongly and unequivocally recommends that City Council’s
plan to vote on Intro 2186 as early as March be delayed until there has been time for truly extensive
outreach to, and dialogue with, community boards and related stakeholders; and
Be it further resolved that no public hearings or reviews on the part of the City Council be held on Intro
2186 until there have been public presentations by the council members or their surrogates, to community
boards and other stakeholders so that there is a comprehensive understanding of the details of and basic
underlying reasoning for the changes; and
Be it finally resolved that this fundamental change to New York City land use procedures and processes,
which requires a City Charter modification, be treated as the 2019 Charter revisions; that is, with city-
wide, open hearings, public feedback opportunities.
Vote: Unanimous, with 44 Board members in favor.
LANDMARKS AND PUBLIC AESTHETICS
FIRST LANDMARKS MEETING
1. *351 Canal Street- Application is to construct an infill of the areaway to create a stair enclosure.
Whereas:
A. The addition fills an unbuilt area at the rear of the building in order to provide a second egress stair
shaft; and
B. The construction has no adverse impact on this distinguished building; and
C. There is very minimal visibility from a public thoroughfare which does not cause any harm; now
Therefore, be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends approval of the application.
Vote: Unanimous, with 44 Board members in favor.
2. *66 W. 9th St. – Application is to alter the areaway and replace a secondary stoop for barrier-free
access.
Whereas:
A. The proposal is to install a lift and add a flight of stairs along the areaway and to build a landing over
the existing stairs and stoop to a retail space; and
B. The modifications are within the area of the existing areaway and the existing stairs and stoop; and
C. The design of the addition, the railings, and the lift in its storage position are respectful of the
building; and
D. The facing of the stairs and the landing are without detail, apart from a recessed niche, and the
design profits from the proposed detailing and rustication, provided that the work is executed with
careful craftsmanship; and
5E. The property would be enhanced by the planting of a tree in the existing pit; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends approval of the application provided that the
facing of the stairs and the landing have detailing and rustication executed with the careful craftsmanship
evident in the building.
Vote: Unanimous, with 44 Board members in favor.
3. *233 Bleecker Street - Application is to reclad existing 1st floor facade, enlarge and opening,
repaint existing window mullions, install new front entry door to match existing, and install new
retractable awnings, and signage.
Whereas:
A. The building, in a prominent position in the district, once served as a stagecoach station with rooms
for drivers in the second floor and the ground floor was converted to several small stores with
wooden infill in historic style; and
B. The building, with its extant original second floor, was the inspiration for the Edward Hopper
painting, Early Sunday Morning which depicts historic and presumably original storefronts; and
C. The entire facade and windows of the ground floor are covered in plywood; and
D. The applicant represented that probing of the facade showed only a minimal amount of original
material; and
E. The cladding is of modern design in wood painted black with stainless steel detailing and the
windows are plate glass on Carmine Street and operable glass doors on Bleecker Street; and
F. The signage is two backlit stainless metal script logos with “halo” lighting and two gooseneck
lights for each and a blade sign represented as conforming to regulations on Bleecker Street; and
G. The vast amount of glazing brings danger that an unacceptable amount of interior light will spill
into the street and take the focus from the historic building to the retail space within; and
H. The proposed design has no coherent relationship with the building’s architecture, and instead
references the regrettable pre- designation modern storefront of the previous tenant, resulting in a
generic modern first floor with the intact original second floor atop and a jarringly dissonant
relationship between the two; and
I. There is ample opportunity to install a retail facade that reflects the unique history of the building
and is suitable to the neighborhood; and
J. The design does harm to the district in an especially prominent location on Bleecker Street facing
Fr. Demo Park; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB, 2 Man. recommends denial of the application as out of context with
the building and with the district when there is opportunity to design a suitable cladding, infill, and
detailing that is in harmony with the original second floor of the building and the historic district.
6Vote: Passed, with 41 Board members in favor, and 3 in opposition (M. Metzger, B. Page, R. Sanz).
4. *63 Gansevoort St.- Application is to add one story to an existing one-story building.
Whereas:
A. The original three-story building was demolished in the 1930s and replaced by a one-story repair
garage with a large opening for vehicles and two small entrances at the east side; and
B. The proposed modified opening is the size of the large original garage opening on the west and
the small side doors to the east are intact; and
C. The ground floor is white painted existing brick and the infill is wood and glass with a bulkhead
in three sections with prominent divisions and the doors in wood
D. A second floor is to be added with an approximately 12’ 6” tall sloping glass wall (characterized
by the applicant as a skylight) set immediately behind the narrow gutter beside the coping of the
first floor; and
E. No examples of similar height rooftop additions or rooftop additions without considerable setbacks
were presented by the applicant; and
F. The wall and an adjoining roof are wood framing with plain glass in front of a glass penthouse; and
G. There is mechanical equipment at the rear of the building which is not visible from a public
thoroughfare and there is minimal visibility of the rooftop structure from Little West 12th Street; and
H. The wooden mullions and demarcations of the three sections as infill in the garage entrance have no
industrial or contextual reference to, or acknowledgment of, the historic purpose of the opening; and
I. The overwhelming large glass wall is far larger than a skylight, and does not serve the purpose of a
skylight; and
J. The proposed second story completely overwhelms the existing building and results in an
improportioned two-story building rather than rather than an existing one-story building with a
setback penthouse; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends denial of the application with non-contextual and
non-historic design for the existing building and an overly large glass rooftop addition that overpowers
the existing and is without historical reference and out of keeping with the neighborhood.
Vote: Unanimous, with 44 Board members in favor.
7SECOND LANDMARKS MEETING
5. *14-16 Fifth Ave-Application is to demolish the existing row houses converted to apartment
buildings and to construct a new 19-story apartment building.
Whereas:
A. Two 25’ wide row houses built c1848 and converted to one apartment building, with typical
exterior stairs, stoop, and detailing removed in 1937 are proposed to be demolished; and
B. The facade is simple brownstone and the original volume is retained, making the building fit well
into the streetscape; and
C. The buildings have considerable cultural and social significance connected to early industrialists,
inventors, philanthropists, jurists, railroad tycoons and civil war generals, as well as writers, actors,
editors, and political reformers reflecting the character of the neighborhood as it changed from
homes of the early occupants who were socially prominent to the center of bohemian culture; and
D. The applicant showed numerous buildings in the district and other landmarked districts that had
been considerably altered or replaced and none of the replacements in the district were out of scale
with the original buildings; and
E. The proposed building is 19 stories and 241’ feet high, including a 31’ tall mechanical tower and its
overall design and detailing are, in general, inspired by the older apartment buildings in the area
along Fifth Avenue; and
F. The building’s height is far out of proportion to the 50’ wide Fifth Avenue frontage and is higher
than all of the buildings on Fifth Avenue below 14th Street except for 1 Fifth Avenue, built as a
hotel; and
G. The upper irregular setbacks on the upper floors are overly articulated compared to other buildings
in the district; and
H. The impact on the views along Fifth Avenue were only shown when the building is viewed from a
distance, with an unconvincing narrative that the height fits harmoniously with the neighboring
buildings along Fifth Avenue; and
I. No shadow studies were shown when it is evident that there is considerable impact to the west in the
morning and to the east on Fifth Avenue in the afternoon; and
J. The board received approximately 360 letters from the public in opposition to the demolition and
the proposed construction and 3 letters in support of the proposal from real estate interests, and a
number of elected officials are on record as opposing the application; and
K. Approximately 100 members of the public attended the committee meeting and approximately 50
spoke in opposition to the application and 4 spoke in favor; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:
A. Denial of the demolition of the historic buildings owing to their cultural and social significance and
the importance of their scale to the streetscape; and
8B. That any building on the site be no higher than the neighboring building immediately to the north
because of the relatively small 50’ frontage on Fifth Avenue in order to not disturb the rhythm of the
buildings in the block and to minimize the shadow impact; and
C. That the setbacks be simplified in keeping with the existing buildings along Fifth Avenue.
Vote: Passed, with 39 Board members in favor, and 5 in opposition (J.P. DeVerna, M. Metzger, B. Pape,
R. Sanz, A. Zeldin).

Vote: Unanimous, with 44 Board members in favor.
SCHOOLS & EDUCATION
1. Resolution Calling for Fully Funding Our Public Schools
Whereas:
1. Fifteen years after the Campaign for Fiscal Equity case was settled, New York City schools are
still owed $1.1 billion1;
2. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act provided New York State
with $1.037 billion specifically for education for the current State fiscal year2;
1 https://www.aqeny.org/school-district-owed/.
2 http://www.nysed.gov/news/2020/state-education-department-announces-process-local-educational-agencies-apply-12-
billion#:~:text=The%20CARES%20Act%20provides%20%2430.75,and%20respond%20to%20the%20coronavirus.&text=%E2%80%9CThi
s%20federal%20funding%20is%20imperative,recovering%20and%20moving%20forward%20safely.%E2%80%9D
103. Instead of increasing overall education funding with federal dollars, the Governor supplanted
education funding by reducing the State contribution by $1 billion statewide, just when schools
needed more resources to meet the greater needs arising from the pandemic3;
4. In December 2020, the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2021
(CRRSA Act) was signed into law, which will provide $4 billion to New York State for education
purposes4;
5. There is no clause in the CRRSA Act that prohibits supplantation, thus, making it possible for the
Governor to again reduce the State share of the education funding;
6. The pandemic has greatly increased resource needs in our public schools:
a. Reliable internet connectivity and digital devices for students and classrooms will continue
to require resources;
b. More teachers are needed for socially distanced in-person teaching and for managing
multiple cohorts of students in blended and fully remote learning without unacceptable
class sizes;
c. School personnel will continue to require Personal Protective Equipment at least until
“herd immunity” is achieved; and,
d. There is a significant and immediate need for counselors and social workers in every
school to address the trauma experienced by students as well as school staff;
7. Now more than ever our students need more resources to begin healing and recovering from the
pandemic, let alone make up the learning losses;
8. There were several bills to increase revenues passed by the Senate but vetoed by the Governor
during the last session;
9. While many New Yorkers face eviction, job loss, food insecurity and inadequate health care as a
result of the pandemic, New York’s 120 billionaires saw their wealth increase by $77 billion
during Covid-19 to a total of $600 billion5; and,
10. A coalition of organizations has introduced a comprehensive set of revenue bills, which, if
enacted, will raise enough revenue to fill the State’s fiscal gap.
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. urges the Governor and State Legislature to:
1. Not supplant State education funds with federal stimulus money;
2. Fully fund Foundation Aid with State funding; and,
3. Pass revenue-increasing bills that will make New York State’s tax code more progressive and
equitable.
VOTE: Passed, with 43 Board Members in favor, and 1 in opposition (R. Sanz).

112. Resolution to Reopen Pre-K-12 Schools
Whereas:
1. The NYC Department of Education’s turbulent and abrupt reopenings and closings of NYC
schools have provided no consistency for principals, teachers, families and students throughout the
2020-21 school year:
a. In the fall, the reopening of public schools was twice delayed to late September and early
October;
b. On Wednesday, November 18, the DOE announced that public schools would return to
fully remote learning, effective Thursday, November 19, 2020 when the seven-day average
test positivity rate reached 3%;
c. Ten days later, on November 30, the mayor announced that elementary and District 75
schools would reopen on December 7, 2020, even as the citywide positivity rate rose above
5%. Meanwhile, the city gave families no clarity about when middle and high schools
would reopen;
d. On Monday, February 8, 2021, the mayor announced that middle schools would reopen on
Thursday, February 25, 2021, more than three months after they closed. As part of the
reopening plan, the DOE will increase staffing for weekly testing at school sites and in the
“Situation Room” charged with tracking and responding to potential cases. Meanwhile, the
DOE gave families no clarity about when high schools would reopen; and,
e. As part of the testing and tracing program, whenever a NYC DOE building has more than
two confirmed Covid cases in two different classrooms, every class and school located in
the building closes for up to ten days;
2. The DOE has not given families the opportunity to opt in to in-person learning since November
2020 despite promises last summer that there would be multiple “open enrollment” periods
throughout the academic year to switch from remote-only learning to in-person learning;
3. All NYC Teachers are eligible for vaccination under the NYS 1b classification and vaccinations
have been underway for weeks;
4. On February 11, 2021, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention issued updated guidelines
for operating schools during Covid-196;
5. In response, the American Federation of Teachers issued a statement highlighting the CDC’s
“rigorous road map, based on science” that its members can use to fight for a safe reopening” and
called on Congress to “make this guidance real” and to secure needed federal funding7; and,
6. Attending school in-person is optimal for the social-emotional and academic development for
many (but not all) students.
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. implores the Mayor and the Department of Education to:
1. Ensure that NYC Public Schools receive enough city, state and federal funding to comply with
CDC Guidelines for operating schools during COVID-19;
6 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/schools.html
7 https://www.aft.org/press-release/afts-weingarten-cdcs-schools-reopening-guidelines
122. Streamline and centralize the online appointment process so that educators who teach children in
grades PK to 12 can receive vaccinations as expeditiously as possible;
3. Provide clarity for students and families about parameters for reopening high schools;
4. Reinstate “open enrollment” periods when families may opt in to in-person learning; and,
5. Develop a plan for more fully reopening public schools in Fall 2021 that must include
superintendents, principals, teachers, parents and students and meaningful and measurable
outreach to marginalized community members.
VOTE: Unanimous, with 44 Board Members in favor.
SLA LICENSING
1. NoHo Cultural Society Inc. d/b/a Zero Bond, 0 Bond Street a/k/a 670 Broadway 10012 (CL#
1307607 – Alteration)
i. Whereas, the Applicant and the Applicant’s Attorney appeared before CB2, Manhattan’s SLA
Committees #1 & #2 to present an application to the NYS Liquor Authority for an alteration to their
existing Club License (Lic. #1307607, exp 7/31/2022) to (1) expand the licensed premises from the 4th
and 5th floor to include a small 300 sq. ft. portion of the ground floor which serves as the lobby/reception
area for access to the upper floors of the currently existing licensed premises and to (2) add an additional
service bar to the ground floor lobby/reception area; and
ii. Whereas, the premises is approximately 17,300 sq. ft. (lobby – 300 sq. ft. (currently unlicensed); 4th
floor – 3,500 sq. ft.; 5th floor – 10,000 sq. ft.; and a 3,500 sq. ft., as yet “to be constructed”, 6th
floor/enclosed rooftop addition – no plans have been filed to begin construction) and operates as a non-
profit private members club, meeting hall and workspace with two accessory use restaurants (a
sushi/omakase dining area and a brassiere) and bar and lounge areas operating in less than 5,000 sq. ft. of
the licensed space in order to conform with applicable zoning regulations, the premises is currently
located on the 4th and 5th floors of a commercially operated, landmarked, five-story building located on
the northeast corner of Broadway and Bond Street (Block #530/Lot #1); extensive documentation
accompanied the original application outlining the legal zoning use as a “meeting hall” for the 4th, 5th and
the yet to be constructed 6th floors, including a letter from the Applicant’s land use attorney, which stated
“that the dining areas, which are accessory uses, nevertheless would meet the restriction of being less than
5,000 sf in area (ZR 42-14(D). As such, the Site’s dining areas would be permitted as of right on their
own. Although members are permitted to take their food and drink throughout the facility, the dining area
is not the primary use for the space nor is the facility a restaurant. The dining area has its own designated
space for those members who choose to eat and drink on site;” the description for use of the 4th and 5th
floors on the Certificate of Occupancy is Meeting Hall; and,
iii. Whereas, the instant application is to extend the licensed premises from the existing partial 4th floor
and 5th floor licensed premises to now include the ground floor lobby via the exclusive and contiguous
elevator shaft and to add a service bar in what was previously a small office to the 300 sq. ft.
lobby/entrance located at the Southeast corner of the building, which is located mid-block on Bond Street;
the only street frontage for the premises is on Bond Street consisting of the approximately 10' double door
entryway and the additional elevator shaft, the entire frontage being 24', the ground floor being an
unlicensed exclusive entry/lobby for the elevator to the upper floors for members and guests of Zero
Bond; and
13iv. Whereas, the Applicant stated that there would continue to be no service of alcohol in the interior
ground floor lobby/reception area, the lobby itself having no seating or tables or other area for eating
and/or drinking and no relevant use that would necessitate a permanent alteration for a service bar or
extension of the premises through the contiguous elevator shaft from the current partial 4th floor and 5th
floor; and
v. Whereas, the applicant stated that the sole purpose of extending the licensed premises to the
lobby/reception area and adding a service bar to the lobby is at this point the speculative approval of an
outdoor dining area via the current NYC Open Restaurants program; the current guidelines for the NYC
Open Restaurants program clearly stating among various requirements that “To be eligible to participate
in Open Restaurants, your restaurant or food service business must: Be located on the ground floor;” the
Applicant’s attorney explaining that in order to extend the license to the outdoor areas, the licensed
premises must be contiguous to the street; the Applicant’s attorney further stating that the NYC Opening
Restaurants Application was self-certified and therefore despite the clear guidelines requiring ground
floor location that the presumption should be that the application would be approved if and when it was
filed; and
vi. Whereas, the Applicant further stated that if approved to extend the licensed premises to the
lobby/reception area and add a service bar that they would then be able to state that they would qualify as
having a ground floor food service establishment eligible to offer food and alcohol service thereby
making the Applicant eligible for outdoor dining through the NYC Open Restaurants program,
notwithstanding that the ground floor area is a small lobby and reception area occupying 300 sq. ft. which
serves as the exclusive entry area for Members and Guests to access the upper floors via a dedicated and
private elevator; and
vii. Whereas, while sympathetic to the hardship experienced by the Applicant due to the Covid-19
pandemic, the ABC officer of the Applicant being a CB2, Man. member and a well-regarded and
respected operator who also serves on the Board of the local Business Improvement District and Board of
a local community benefit organization, Community Board 2 questions whether a non-profit private
members club, meeting hall and workspace with eating and drinking accessory uses in limited areas of the
premises all located on the 4th and 5th floors qualifies as a food establishment for the purposes of
participating in the current NYC Open Restaurants program; and
viii. Whereas, it is unclear if the instant application (the extension of the premises to the ground floor
lobby and reception area and the addition of a service bar to the lobby with no interior lobby service)
would be considered as ground floor frontage for certification in the NYC Open Restaurants program; and
ix. Whereas, there were further concerns expressed as to whether it was in the public interest or the
intent of the NYC Open Restaurants program to have a private members club take over public sidewalk
and street space at no cost for the exclusive and sole purpose of serving their private members, the
program being designed for restaurants and bars; the Applicant was willing to consider having a few
tables available for nearby residents or members of the public; the issue being raised that the Applicant
would be in violation of its Club License which only allows for service to members and their guests and
disallows sales to members of the general public; and
x. Whereas, additional concerns were raised about the size of the outdoor dining, the street frontage of
the building being 130 feet with 16-foot-wide sidewalks; the Applicant stating outdoor seating would be
limited to no more than 75 persons; and
14xi. Whereas, the intent of the NYC Open Restaurants program was to “expand outdoor seating options
for ground floor, brick and mortar restaurants or bars… to help them rebound during the pandemic by
using the sidewalk or curb lane adjacent to their business”; the reduced capacity of indoor dining being
temporary in nature; the Applicant stating the reduced interior capacity being the reason the Applicant
wished to participate in the NYC Open Restaurant program, that roadbed and/or sidewalk dining was
never part of the business plan, the Applicant stating that the outdoor seating would be temporary in
nature even though the alteration application seeks a permanent change to the licensed premises, and
despite repeatedly being asked if he would put a time limit on the exterior eating and drinking was
nonetheless unwilling to put any limit as to the length of time there would be roadbed and/or sidewalk
seating beyond 2021; and
xii. Whereas, it was further unclear why the Applicant had not applied for the NYC Open Restaurant

first determine eligibility for that program, that being the stated underlying reason for this application,
prior to applying to extend the licensed premises to the ground floor and creating a service bar, both of
which only determine the ability to serve alcohol in the outdoor area and would not dictate whether the
outdoor area was eligible for the NYC Open Restaurant program; and

a Club License for NoHo Cultural Society, Inc. d/b/a Zero Bond, 0 Bond Street a/k/a 670 Broadway

THEREFORE, BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that when the application is considered by the
NYSLA, CB2, Man. respectfully requests that this item be calendared so that it may appear before the
Members of the Authority for determination and so that CB2, Man. may be heard on the alteration
application; and
THEREFORE, BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that CB2, Man. respectfully recommends the
following stipulations be imposed should the Applicant receive a permit to participate in the NYC Open

apartment building (circa 1900) on northeast corner of West 10th and West 4th Streets, this building falling
within NYC LPC’s designated Greenwich Village Historic District; and,
ii. Whereas, the corner storefront premise was previously operated as a restaurant (Chez Sardine/Bar
Sardine), at which time operable windows were installed at this location, albeit not on notice to this
Community Board via alteration application, this particular location also being in a heavily-saturated area
for liquor licenses, there being multiple licensed locations on every corner and side of this intersection or

above and adjacent to the licensed premises where none previously existed, this application being subject
to the 500 foot rule and public interest standard; and,
vii. Whereas, in light of said opposition and objections raised to this application, the Applicant agreed

15. Rajmar Holdings, Inc. d/b/a Hudson Bar & Books, 636 Hudson St. 10014 (OP-Tavern)
(Alteration to add previously unlicensed storefront to licensed premise)
i. Whereas, the Applicant and the Applicant’s Attorney appeared before CB2, Manhattan’s SLA
Licensing Committee to present an application to the Liquor Authority for an alteration of an on-premise
liquor license for the purpose of expanding and adding an adjacent storefront located in the same building
to licensed premise; and,
ii. Whereas, the Licensee and Applicant already operates a cigar bar in the south storefront of 636
Hudson Street, and plans to expand the bar to the north contiguous storefront, previously operated for
years as a retail clothing boutique for women known as Annelore that closed by 7:00 PM, by building an
interior doorway between the two storefronts, the two storefronts being located in a five-story tenement
style apartment building (circa 1900) on Hudson Street between Horatio and Janes Streets, this building
falling within NYC LPC’s designated Greenwich Village Historic District; and,
iii. Whereas, no plans were provided for the existing cigar bar, which according to the Application is
900 sq. ft. (450 sq. ft. ground floor and 450 sq. ft. basement), has 1 bar with 12 seats, 6 tables with 18
patron seats for a total seating capacity of 30, with the second storefront to be added being half the size in
appearance to the existing bar but still being described as being the same size as the existing bar, it being
impossible to make any measurement of the combined space in that no diagram of the existing licensed
premise was ever provided; and,
iv. Whereas, the plan is to operate the previously unlicensed north storefront from 3:00 PM to 3:00
AM Monday through Thursday and from 3:00 PM to 4:00 AM Friday through Sunday, albeit smoke free,
in contradiction to the existing bar’s legacy business, with six tables and 12 seats, two banquets with 6
additional seats and one counter with five seats for a total patron seating occupancy of 22, with one
bathroom, two TVs, all facades remaining fixed and without the installation of operable windows or
French doors, music on the interior being at background levels only, with no d.j., no promoted events, no
scheduled performances or cover fees, there is a sidewalk café with 4 tables and 8 seats; and
v. Whereas, neither a certificate of occupancy nor letter of no objection from the NYC DOB
permitting eating and drinking was presented with this application for each storefront, or for the
combination of the two storefronts; and,
iv. Whereas, there was extensive and significant opposition to this application was heard from the
Community and those living across the Street, adjacent to and behind the existing licensed premise, there
being years of problems with smoke exhaust coming from the ventilation systems of the existing cigar bar
in the rear of the building, being so invasive and toxic that residents cannot open their windows, there
likewise being extensive problems with late night noise coming from the exterior seating in front of the
bar, the chairs and tables never being cleared through the late night and early morning hours, causing
patrons and others seated in the exterior café after until 4:00 AM, that the operator/owner is never
responsive to neighbor’s complaints and that the entire storefront space is often rented out to third parties
which throw large, noisy parties at the licensed premise; and,
28v. Whereas, there were also complaints raised and photographs presented demonstrating a fully
enclosed extension built in front of the licensed premises which extended out and over the public sidewalk
from the building façade, the constructed extension taking over the public sidewalk, without permits and
not conforming with the open restaurants guidelines, resulting in violations from the NYC DOB for
constructing it without permits (Nov. 24, 2020), the non-conforming structure without ventilation and
unsafe, an outdoor speaker installed inside; and,
vi. Whereas, this licensee also has a documented history of discriminating against his customers, with
videos posted in social media (yelp and Instagram reviews) demonstrating racist rants against Black
people; and,
vii. Whereas, the Applicant has not demonstrated that public interest and public convenience is served
from the addition of the second storefront to the existing licensed premise, the storefront to be added has
never been licensed for the service of alcohol, the prior business at the same location closing by 7:00 PM
every night, the request here is to be open until 4:00 AM, this area and the immediate block being highly
saturated with liquor licenses, there being 69 liquor licenses within 750 of the licensed premise, the
immediate block having added new liquor licenses in the past 10 years, with this addition of yet another
licensed storefront on this block there being a liquor license at 7 of the 9 total storefronts, the Applicant
despite being given the privilege and opportunity to operate his business with late night hours while not
demonstrating an ability to work with his neighbors or perform simply tasks to control noise, to be a good
neighbor and to prevent unwanted intrusions upon others, the public interest not being served by
permitting this Applicant to increase his footprint in this neighborhood; and,
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that CB2, Man. recommends denial of the alteration application for
the existing On-Premise License for Rajmar Holdings, Inc. d/b/a Hudson Bar & Books, 636 Hudson
St. 10014; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that should this application be considered by the SLA, CB2, Man.
respectfully requests that this item be calendared to appear before the Full Board of the SLA.
Vote: Unanimous, with 44 Board members in favor.
*REVISED RESOLUTION-PLEASE SEE “BOLDED AND UNDERLINED” AREAS FOR
CHANGES. BELOW. IT IS A NEW/TRANSFER LICENSE, NOT AN EXISTING ONE.
14. BFNY Enterprises, Inc. d/ b/a TBD, 569 Hudson St. 10014 (New OP- transfer of On Premise
License)
i. Whereas, the Applicant and the Applicant’s Attorney appeared before CB2, Manhattan’s SLA
Licensing committee to present an application to the Liquor Authority for a transfer of an existing on
premise liquor license to operate a “neighborhood restaurant” in a corner storefront located in a four story
tenement style apartment building (circa 1900) on the northwest corner of Hudson Street and West 11th
Streets, this building falling within NYC LPC’s designated Greenwich Village Historic District; and,
ii. Whereas, the corner storefront premise was previously operated for years as a restaurant (Philip
Marie), a restaurant operating with closing hours daily by 12 AM, with fixed facades and a small sidewalk
café on Hudson Street containing 9 tables and 18 seats on either side of the front door, the long-time
operator of Phillip Marie closing after the advent of the Covid pandemic; and
29iii. Whereas, the ground floor storefront is roughly 1,300 sq. ft., there is a basement but the square
footage for the basement was not provided, instead a diagram of the basement was presented showing
what appears to be a full-service kitchen, the ground floor space having 19 tables with 66 patron seats, 1
stand-up bar with 8 seats for a total patron seating of 74 seats, with two patron bathrooms and a single
patron entrance on Hudson Street, in addition to a side service entrance on West 11th Street (not for patron
use), and despite the prior occupancy/use as a restaurant, neither a certificate of occupancy permitting
eating nor letter of no objection from the NYC DOB was presented with this application; and,
iv. Whereas, the hours of operation initially proposed were Sunday through Saturday from 11:30AM to
2:00AM, with the Applicant later reducing those hours of operation from 11:30 AM to 12:00 AM Sunday
through Saturday, the reduction being consistent with the prior restaurant’s hours of operation, which
closed by 12:00 AM every evening, this application being to transfer the existing operations and method
of operation for the licensed premises, with all facades remaining fixed and without the installation of
operable windows or French doors, music being at background levels only, with no DJ, no promoted
events, no scheduled performances or cover fees, no security, no velvet ropes and no movable barriers on
the sidewalk; and,
v. Whereas, there was significant opposition from the Community to this application, the West
Village Resident’s Association also appearing in opposition, the community opposition focusing on the
Applicant’s negative history operating as the sole licensee of the White Horse Tavern, the Tavern
(SN# 1318058, 567 Hudson St. 10014) being located immediately across West 11th Street from the
proposed premises to be licensed, the Applicant having only operated the White Horse Tavern for the last
year, with the Tavern being the subject of disciplinary proceedings, significant fines and closure imposed
by the NYSLA in July/2020 during the Covid pandemic; and,
vi. Whereas, during the pandemic the Applicant showed a reckless disregard for the safety of others
during the pandemic by blatantly operating in derogation of the Emergency Degrees and Governor’s
Executive Orders relating to the reopening of its business during the pandemic in the Spring and Summer
of 2020, by placing a full service bar on the sidewalk and installing an open platform/deck on the roadway
in an “No Stopping Anytime Zone” in front, selling and serving alcohol for standing consumers, inviting
hordes of people to drink on the sidewalk and in the bike lane without social distancing or being seated,
crowding the sidewalk and bike lane, preventing clearance on the sidewalk for pedestrians, by serving
alcohol and remaining open outside until 1-2 AM repeatedly and consistently refusing to close at the
required closing time period of 11:00 PM, while ignoring the repeated requests and warnings made to it
by the NYPD, requiring the local Sixth Precinct of the NYPD to repeatedly force the closing of the
establishment after midnight; and,
vii. Whereas, such reckless disregard for the safety of others only attracted other licensed premises in
the area and more specifically on Hudson Street to also forgo the rules set forth by the Governor’s
Executive Orders, such derogation ultimately done to obtain individual financial benefit while
exacerbating the continuing pandemic at the expense of those many businesses which did follow the rules
designed to prevent the spread of the virus; and,
viii. Whereas, despite the Applicant being given an opportunity to reopen the White Horse Tavern after
paying significant fines for its recent transgressions, the White Horse Tavern being an iconic location with
a significant history, its exterior operations continue to be non-compliant with the rules of the City of
New York for outdoor dining designed to prevent the continued spread of the pandemic, the enclosed
roadbed sheds being entirely enclosed on Hudson Street and on West 11th Street; and.
30ix. Whereas, this application being subject to the 500 foot rule, requiring the Applicant to demonstrate
that public interest and public convenience is served from the addition of yet another liquor license in this
area, an area already greatly saturated with late night drinking establishments and liquor licenses,
including the Applicant’s other business located across the Street, a business given the continued privilege
to remain open (and with hours of operation until 4 AM every night) despite the Applicant’s past
transgressions, the Applicant’s past transgressions not supporting this application, those past transgression
still being very recent, within the last six months of bringing this particular application, those
transgressions being dangerous to others, showing a reckless disregard for the health and safety of those
living in the immediate area, the City of New York and beyond, with the health of those affected from
such transgressions not being fully known, the Applicant still not demonstrating he can operate within the
published guidelines set from by the State or City of New York; and,

SOCIAL SERVICES
A resolution critiquing New York City’s system for distributing vaccines to protect against the
COVID-19 virus.
WHEREAS:
1. As of this date, the US Government has authorized two vaccines to prevent COVID-19. One is
manufactured by Pfizer-BioNTech and the other by Moderna, and both require a series of two
doses to be effective. The federal government “oversees a central system to order, distribute, and
track COVID-19 vaccines”; and
United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/07/technology/vaccine-algorithms.html?searchResultPosition=2
Office of the Governor, New York State. “Governor Cuomo Updates New Yorkers on State Vaccination Program.” Jan. 19, 2021.
https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-updates-new-yorkers-state-vaccination-program-79-first-doses-delivered-have-been
342. The federal government allocates vaccines to the states on the basis of their population over 18.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issues recommendations for eligibility, but
states are allowed to develop their own systems of prioritization for distribution. As of late
January 2021, New York City had received 546,775 doses of vaccine and had distributed 75% of
them, or 409,403. Phase 1-a of eligibility was essentially limited to healthcare workers and those
in similar professions. Phase1-b began on January 11, 2021, and extended eligibility to those over
age 65 and workers in certain high-risk sectors; and
3. The vaccines are currently in short supply. According to state authorities, New York State has
been allocated roughly 250,000 doses per week to distribute among 7,000,000 people who are
currently eligible for it. The total number of doses administered in New York City as of February
9, 2021, was 1,032,158, which includes 1st and 2nd doses. Fewer than 42,958 doses were on hand
for NYC providers and facilities to use. 413,006 adults were partially vaccinated; 182,697 were
fully vaccinated; and
4. According to data published by the city the distribution of vaccines has been marked by great
racial disparities throughout the city: as of this writing, the first vaccine dose has been distributed
to 5% of whites but just 2% of Blacks and 5% of Latinos. For example, while the Black
community represents 24% of the city’s population it constitutes just 11% of the vaccines
distributed as of January 31; and
5. NYC’s vaccine distribution is led by the NYC COVID-19 Vaccine Command Center, “a dedicated
interagency effort created by the Mayor’s Office” that has designed a website for scheduling
appointments to receive the vaccine. With certain exceptions (such as those eligible to receive the
vaccine through the Veterans’ Administration), NYC residents rely on the website to schedule
their appointment; and
6. NYC’s Vaccine Finder is described as a “one-stop” site to the sites of individual providers. That
is, it is a portal to individual provider websites. Patients select a location by zip code and the
website generates a list of authorized providers. Patients then apply to a provider for a vaccine
appointment once they have established that they are eligible to receive it; and
7. As the home page of the Vaccine Finder states, “each [provider] site manages its own schedules
and appointments. This tool is intended to help make site information – including scheduling
options – easily accessible to New Yorkers”; and
8. In fact, in an environment where vaccines are in tight supply, the Vaccine Finder tool makes
finding an appointment anything but “easily accessible.” Members of Community District 2 report
many experiences that increase their anxiety: providers canceling appointments and directing
patients back to the Vaccine Finder to seek the vaccine elsewhere; difficulty finding a telephone
number, as an alternative to the website, to schedule an appointment; patients spending hours
refreshing the website or waiting on the phone in the hope of finding availability; rumors
circulating of patients who have circumvented the system, or who were able to get an appointment
at the last minute while others have had long-scheduled appointments cancelled; providers posting
appointments once they’ve received supply, only to see them all taken within five minutes of
posting; patients being required to complete an eligibility form before they are able to learn if the
provider has available appointments, and being required to complete a new eligibility form for
each attempt at finding a provider; and

359. The result is that many patients are confused and anxious about a system that creates inequities to
access. Seeking a vaccine is particularly challenging, for example, for those who are homebound;
those with language barriers or wi-fi barriers; those who lack fluency using the internet; those who
are working or caring for a child and who can ill afford to spend hours on the telephone or on the
website seeking an available appointment; and
10. Patients awaiting a vaccine – who are already vulnerable to the health effects of the virus - would
experience less stress if they were reassured of being on a central list to receive one as soon as one
became available, and if the process for seeking a vaccine were less time-consuming; and
11. These problems do not appear to be inherent to a distribution system but rather the failure to create
a central tracking system. Just as many supermarkets create one line for checkout and then
distribute shoppers to the next available cash register, New York City should be able to preserve
each patient’s place “in line” and distribute him to the next available appointment, even if those
appointments are with individual providers and independent healthcare systems, and even if
availability continues to be limited for the near future.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED THAT COMMUNITY BOARD 2, MANHATTAN
1. Appreciates the efforts of New York City leadership, and the hard-working staff at DOHMH and
the Vaccine Command Center, to respond quickly to the unprecedented emergency created by the
COVID-19 virus, and appreciates the wealth of data that is shared on the city’s COVID-19
website, https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page; and
2. Expresses disappointment and frustration in the city’s failure to create a vaccine distribution
system that assures patients, even in the face of temporary vaccine shortage, that once they apply
for a vaccine their place in line will be protected until a vaccine becomes available; and
3. Maintains that a central tracking system with an API (application programming interface) or
provider portal managed by city government is not incompatible with a distribution system that
relies on a multitude of individual providers to actually administer the vaccine; and
4. Recommends the city address the difficulties not only in acquiring a vaccine but also in obtaining
a COVID-19 test, which remains difficult almost one year after COVID-19 first struck our city’s
residents; and
5. Appreciates the efforts of the city’s health department workers to improve the Vaccine Finder as
the department receives ongoing feedback from the public, and hopes that this resolution will
prompt improvements in the design of the Vaccine Finder.
Vote: Unanimous, with 44 Board Members in favor.
TRAFFIC AND TRANSPORTATION
1. Resolution in support of the FURIOUS Act (Fighting Underground Racing In Our Streets), NY
State Senate Bill S77.
\
Whereas during the Pandemic, the decrease in traffic has led to a significant increase in illegal drag
racing on the emptier streets, threatening the safety of all those using the street and creating loud and
piercing noises that invade the environment and disturb people's sleep at night. From March to September
2020 alone, complaints from NYC communities about this always exceedingly dangerous and disrupting
activity increased nearly fivefold from the same period the year before; and
Whereas speed cameras have been shown to be an effective tool in monitoring, identifying and nailing
down the miscreants who engage in these speed contests and in discouraging these activities; and
36Whereas in 2019, NY State authorized expanding the number of speed cameras in NYC to approximately
750 in school zones throughout the City, however, these cameras are limited to operating only on
weekdays between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m., while much of this reckless and harmful speed racing occurs
during nighttime hours and on weekends; and
Whereas NY State Senate Bill S77, also known as the ""FURIOUS"" or ""Fighting Underground Racing In
Our Streets"" Act. provides for speed cameras to be operated in NYC at any time of day and night,
weekdays and weekends (i.e., 24/7) in school speed zone areas that have been identified by their
community boards (in response to local reports and public hearings) as trouble spots where this reckless
speed racing occurs; and
Whereas the ""FURIOUS"" Act also tightens up the NY State Vehicle and Traffic Law to clearly define the
criteria pinpointing those responsible for illegal speed racing, exhibitions and contests, whether engaging
in this activity on the spot or planning it in advance;
Therefore, be it resolved that CB2, Man. strongly supports NY State Senate Bill S77, also known as the
""FURIOUS"" or ""Fighting Underground Racing In Our Streets"" Act; and
Be it further resolved that CB2, Man. urges the NY State Senate to pass this bill as quickly as possible;
and
Be it further resolved that CB2, Man. looks forward to the opportunity to request and have implemented
speed cameras' operations extended to any time of day and night, weekdays and weekends (i.e., 24/7) in
CB2 school speed zone areas where illegal speed racing occurs; and
Vote: Passed, with 43 Board Members in favor, and 3 in opposition (M. Metzger, B. Pape, and C.
Spence).
2. Resolution in support of ""Restorative Ground,"" a design for a temporary Street Seat on
King St. at the n.w. corner of Hudson and King Sts.
Whereas ""Restorative Ground,"" a design for a temporary Street Seat installation to enhance and bring
passive and recreational enjoyment to revive the public realm on King St. at the n.w. corner of Hudson
and King Sts. (between Hudson and Greenwich Sts.), was presented by WIP (Women in Practice), a
collaborative of independent design professionals including architects, landscape architects and urban
designers, who have created the design; and
Whereas ""Restorative Ground"" was the winner, among 50 entries, of ""Care for Hudson Square,"" a design
competition calling for ""a thoughtful reimagined streetscape in a post COVID / government shutdown
New York,"" a ""placemaking installation"" that would ""contribute to the reopening of Hudson Square,""
sponsored by Hudson Square Properties (a jt. venture btw. Hines, Trinity Wall St. and Norges Bank
Investment Management), Urban Design Forum, and the Hudson Square BID. Partners in the project,
which aims to ""respond to the need for shared outdoor space, to activate programming opportunities,
and...offer a beautiful piece to draw attention and foot traffic to the neighborhood,"" include the
competition's sponsors and WIP as well as the NYC Dept. of Transportation (DOT), the NYC Dept. of
Design and Construction (DDC), and The Seed Lighting, among others; and
Whereas ""Restorative Ground,"" scheduled to open in Spring 2021, will function under DOT's Street Seat
program, thus, be open to the public, with no commercial activity, alcohol or smoking allowed and
signage posted to that effect, with parking lane installation that overlaps to the sidewalk, in operation from
37March to November or December and requiring community board approval, but it will include
innovations going beyond the usual Street Seats that offer a wide range of opportunities for activities
serving the community; and
Whereas ""Restorative Ground"" is designed to serve a diverse population of all ages, abilities and
interests, as an inclusive place welcoming residents, workers and visitors and people from all walks of
life, and to that end, includes three ""immersive environments"" for different areas of activity:
• Focused - Emphasis on community gathering and creative opportunity with big tables offering
collective work surfaces and freestanding seats, gently shaped platforms for casual sitting, and low
railings for seated leaning.
• Active - Emphasis on energetic movement, high stimulation, spontaneous and tactile
opportunities, individual and group recreation, with vertical curved rails for climbing, hanging,
balancing and leaning, sloped faces terracing up to an active area peak and with soft rope holds for
climbing.
• Calm - Emphasis on relaxation, lounging and restorative activities with low bench-height
platforms for resting, curved rails for upright leaning and lounge hammocks of strong paracord
mesh/netting.; and
Whereas ""Restorative Ground"" is also conceived for easy maintenance. Recycled rubber surfacing and
water-resistant marine plywood will provide both safe and easy to clean surfaces, and artificial turf at the
top of higher levels along with the rubber surface will help discourage skateboarding. The materials are
anti-microbial. Hudson Square Properties will provide regular power washing, and someone will be on-
site to do repairs. Existing trees and planting areas will be protected by drainable metal grates over their
bases that allow for rainwater to penetrate; and
Whereas safety features include a ledge that's higher around the street edge and a brightly colored railing
along the street side. LED lights embedded inside the various steel tube railings will be located
throughout the project, providing day and night illumination. 24-hour security monitoring will be
arranged by Hudson Square Properties; and
Whereas interviews were conducted to ascertain needs and guide the design, and outreach is being done
to connect with community groups and institutions and define programming. Interest and support are
already being received from such groups as the Children's Museum of Art and HERE Arts; and
Whereas there are no seats with backs to accommodate older people, the disabled and others who rely on
back support, which would be needed for them to participate in the enjoyment of the space, but the
designers have indicated that they'll consider adding supportive backs to certain freestanding seating; and
Whereas the intention is to donate this streetscape following the first season back to the Urban Design
Forum to install in an underserved community; Community Board 2 Manhattan (CB2) supports applying
this concept to benefit such a community and even several of them, but would like to have the option to
keep this initial installation in place so that it can continue to bring the multifaceted enjoyment it promises
to the CB2, Man. community;
Therefore, be it resolved that CB2, Man. fully supports installing ""Restorative Ground,"" on King St. at
the n.w. corner of Hudson and King Sts. (between Hudson and Greenwich Sts.), and looks forward to our
neighbors enjoying its enhancement of our public space and the many passive and recreational benefits it
will bring to our community; and
38Be it further resolved that CB2, Man. urges that at least some seating be provided with backs to
accommodate those who would need them for using and enjoying the benefits of this community space;
and
Be it finally resolved that CB2, Man. expresses its strong desire to keep ""Restorative Ground"" in the
CB2, Man. community, i.e. on King St. at the n.w. corner of Hudson and King Sts., (between Hudson and
Greenwich Sts.) and encourages having the design reproduced and/or adapted in other, underserved
communities.

STANDING COMMITTEE REPORTS
LAND USE AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
Response to SoHo NoHo Neighborhood Plan: Draft Scope of Work for an Environmental
Impact Statement (CEQR #21DCP059M) (ULURP Nos. Pending)
We are at an inflection point. Urban retail has been thrown into disarray. Long-standing local businesses
are fighting for their survival. We are only just beginning to understand Covid-19’s impact on office,
retail and residential space, let alone deal with its human toll on our city. The ongoing pandemic is an
unprecedented attack on our city, and it is fair to ask: What will our neighborhoods look like after this
long winter? Will we come back fairer and stronger?
The “SoHo/NoHo Neighborhood Plan Draft Scope of Work” ignores the majority of the Envision
SoHo/NoHo Report and its 27 recommendations, ensures profit-making for a few, offers almost nothing
to protect and improve what is so irreplaceable about these districts, and it does little to deliver the vital
affordable housing our city needs now.
SoHo and NoHo were landmarked for a reason. The choices we make now, most irreversible, will define
and reshape our neighborhoods for the next decades. Do we really want to turn our community into
cookie-cutter copies of what can be found all over the city?
CB2, Man. sounds a clear warning on seven key issues:
1. Preserve our uniqueness: Let’s do no harm. The beloved, gritty, artistic, human-scale creativity of
these streets and their varied storefronts is a national treasure, but it can easily be destroyed.
Response to SoHo NoHo Neighborhood Plan: Draft Scope of Work for an Environmental Impact
Statement (CEQR #21DCP059M) (ULURP Nos. Pending)
SoHo and NoHo have already proven to have a highly successful, distinctive, functioning eco- system that
perennially attracts retailers, shoppers, artists and tourists from all over the world, generating significant
revenue for the City and State.
3The success of these neighborhoods is in part the result of a stable regulatory framework that is a
combination of the creative amendment of the M1-5A and M1-5B zoning texts, including the Special
Permit requirements, the Loft Law, and the creation of the historic districts.
2. Keep it artistic: The presence of galleries, resident artists and cultural spaces has been key to our
success for the past 50 years and has transformed our neighborhoods into world-renowned centers of art
and creativity.
This requires constant efforts to nurture, sustain and attract cultural institutions, art galleries, artists and
the evolving creative and “maker” communities.
Let’s retain and perpetuate the creative arts character of these neighborhoods, whether in new
construction or adaptive reuse.
3. Get serious about affordable housing: As our city rebuilds in the aftermath of Covid-19, how do
we achieve housing and social justice after an economic free-fall?
Our community supports affordable housing.
We need a better approach than Mandatory Inclusionary Housing (MIH), which has shown to be
ineffective as a zoning tool for affordable housing, as demonstrated most recently in the Flushing
rezoning that, per citylimits.org (Nov. 11, 2020), that will produce only 75-90 affordable units out of 1725
in only one out of four residential sites.
MIH guarantees lucrative developer payoffs and offers only modest promises of affordable units to reach
the equitable housing goals specifically identified as a core reason to rush forward with this plan. It
includes loopholes that allow developers to opt-out through “hardship” or simply build all-commercial
buildings instead.
Any new residential development should adequately address the displacement of long-term residents and
low-income residents.
We reject towering blocks of luxury housing that impact negatively on the character of our neighborhoods.
The outlined best-case scenario of 328 to 494 affordable units ignores the socioeconomic impact of up to
1355 ultra-luxury, market-rate apartments.
We reject incentivization of office use over residential uses.
We reject any plans for a blanket up-zoning. Let’s actually grasp what the new balance will be between
retail, commercial and residential as those markets stabilize and recalibrate.
Community Board 2, Man. calls for the expanded conversation on affordable housing that the City should
have undertaken during Envision SoHo NoHo. One-size-fits-all programs are not the solution.
4. Update, but don’t oversize: Everyone agrees that the special permit process needs streamlining.
Ground floor spaces should be available to lively, appropriate retail businesses, without requiring special
permits.
SoHo and NoHo are mixed-use neighborhoods with sizeable residential populations. Let’s not unleash a
land grab of oversized retail and eating and drinking establishments that would crowd out smaller retailers
and local neighborhood restaurants, reduce the variety and total number of businesses, and wreak havoc
on residential life.
4Let’s not create an environment that favors big box retail over small businesses. The current restrictions
are working and deserve protection: no retail over 10,000sf; a 5,000sf cap on eating and drinking. Those
uses should be restricted to below the second floor, as is common throughout the city.
5. Encourage adaptive reuse: The magic of our streets started with the spontaneous transformation by
artists of existing industrial space into lofts, imaginative retail and creative office use. SoHo and NoHo
exemplify the great transformation and success of New York City in the postindustrial era. This adaptive
reuse model inspired a development style now used in readapting industrial areas around the world.
Further evolution of this successful transformation should be encouraged through adaptive reuse without
new, out-of-scale construction.
6. Protect current occupants: Our neighborhoods need a fair resolution of residential controversies that
produces permanent, equitable affordability. That means:
• Record and protect current affordable rental units.
• Identify a mechanism to legalize residential occupancy in manufacturing units without disrupting
legal conforming occupants through a public process.
• Protect resident artists and protect the joint live-work manufacturing framework for their lofts,
including those still in the transition process from Interim Multiple Dwelling status.
• Identify solutions to help adapt spaces for those aging in place and maintain the unique protections
under The Loft Law for our pioneering artist residents.
7. Examine the financial implications: The Draft Scope of work requires an economic analysis across
the entire study area. The current focus on only 27 projected sites (out of approximately 850 lots) fails to
address the array of other development possibilities. Transparency was promised; we expect it.
Now is not the time for business as usual. The pressure of your timeline is self-imposed and the
consequences of moving forward with the wrong plan are stark. Making the wrong choices will without
doubt kill what is unique, world-renowned and profitable about SoHo and NoHo without achieving our
shared goal.
No Scope or Environmental Impact Study compiled now, during an ongoing global upheaval, could
possibly be an accurate assessment of any neighborhood or provide the basis for changes we will live with
for decades. While everything is in monumental flux, we call for caution and innovative thinking—the
creation of a comprehensive, long-range vision implemented in carefully-designed, incremental stages.
That process should begin with an examination of the shortcomings of the current draft scope of work and
the presentation (for public review before any ULURP begins) of a new draft scope that reflects those
shortcomings, plus the impact of the pandemic on the residential, commercial and retail sectors of our
economy.
Herewith the resolution that documents the basis for our concerns. It is based on input from two Land Use
Committee meetings and a public hearing with 175+ attendees and 40+ speakers. The resolution follows
the outline of the draft scope of work for the proposed plan:
WHEREAS:
A. INTRODUCTION
1. This proposal is the first-ever upzoning of an historic district since the creation of the Landmarks
Preservation Commission (LPC) in 1965.
52. This Draft Scope is only 61 pages long and explores the impact of 27 projected development sites and
57 potential development sites. In comparison, the Bushwick Draft Scope is 201 pages long and analyzes
167 projected sites. The Draft Scope for the Gowanus Rezoning, led by not only Department of City
Planning (DCP) but also by NYC HPD and NYC Parks, is 237 pages long and analyzes 60 projected sites.
Clearly, the Gowanus and Bushwick proposals have benefitted from having been started prior to the
pandemic.
3. On p. 1, the Draft Scope states that this proposal was “informed by local and citywide stakeholders
during the Envision SoHo/NoHo process, a public engagement initiative undertaken in 2019” by
Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer, City Council Member for City Council District 1 Margaret
Chin, and DCP.
4. The report, “Envision SoHo/NoHo: Summary and Recommendations,” created by the plan sponsors at
the end of the Envision process concluded with 25+ “Suggested Areas for Further Analysis/Study,” p.
85). There is no evidence in the Draft Scope that any additional work on those areas has been done (see
Task 1).
5. On p. 1, the Draft Scope’s Reasonable Worst-Case Development Scenario expects a net increase of
approximately 1,683 dwelling units, only 20%-29% of which would be “affordable” units. CB2 is looking
for a greater percentage of affordable units in any new development.
6. Long before the pandemic, many retail spaces remained empty. Adding 57,473gsf of projected
destination retail space (p.1) without any mention of how small local retail would be protected is of grave
concern.
The goal of expanding housing opportunities by “requiring permanently affordable housing” is mentioned
on p. 2, but there are no details or mechanism described in the Draft Scope for either the preservation of
current affordable housing or the legalization of existing residents in SoHo and NoHo. Nor did the Draft
Scope study the number of affordable units and how many of these units are occupied by residents over
60, who are aging in place and comprise a Naturally Occurring Retirement Community (NORC). This
was a topic of extreme concern and importance during the Envision process.
7. To achieve the goal on p. 2 of preserving historic resources, adaptive reuse of existing buildings could
yield a significant number of affordable units more quickly than an upzoning, without greatly increasing
the stock of luxury market-rate units.
8. The Draft Scope seeks to promote economic recovery, resiliency, and growth by allowing a wider
range of uses (p.2), but many property owners have kept rents high to satisfy mortgage requirements, hold
out for “credit tenants,” and/or use high rent potential as a way to finance other locations, causing long-
term retail vacancies.
9. Many of the introduction’s stated objectives are contradicted by the Proposed Action. For example:
Requiring permanently affordable housing to “support income diversity” is an objective, one with which
CB2 agrees. However, CB2 questions how adding 70-80% market-rate housing based on incentives that
may never be realized will ever ensure affordable housing.
10. Another objective is to “establish appropriate densities and building forms that ensure new
development harmonizes with neighborhood context and scale (p.2).” Historic districts do this by their
very nature, and 85% of the proposed upzoning area is in such districts. The proposed increase in as-of-
right FAR would significantly redefine neighborhood context and scale rather than harmonizing with the
existing historic building forms.
6B. REQUIRED APPROVALS AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
C. BACKGROUND TO THE PROPOSED ACTIONS
PROJECT AREA HISTORY
A DIVERSIFYING ECONOMY AND A GROWING RESIDENTIAL PRESENCE
1. Artist Certification: p. 5 of the Draft Scope, states that “many residents did not qualify for artist
certification.” The absence of certification is a problem with the certification process and the agency
overseeing it. It does not indicate a lack of artists.
Discussions with many working artists in SoHo and NoHo during the Envision SoHo/NoHo meetings
clarified that the Department of Cultural Affairs (DCLA) certification was haphazard, complicated and,
since it had not been enforced for so long, unnecessary for artists residing in Joint Live-Work Quarters for
Artists (JLWQA) housing in SoHo and NoHo.
2. Special permits and variances: p. 5 of the Draft Scope states that “the area sees an extraordinarily high
volume of applications for special permits and variances to locate or legalize retail uses.” CB2’s
opportunity to weigh in is vital for community representation in the application process. With removal of
these reviews, only speculation and profit govern retail uses, rather than their desirability in a mixed-use
neighborhood.
3. P. 5 of the Draft Scope acknowledges that the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted SoHo and NoHo, and
then makes an unsubstantiated assumption that office, retail, accommodation and food services will
remain core economic assets in the long term. Pandemic-related questions include:
a. Who will come back to work in offices and will the offices have the appropriate infrastructure to
ensure safety?
b. Would office, hotel and other properties currently under distress become available for city
acquisition, perhaps in partnership with a not-for-profit to create 100% affordable housing in
existing structures?
c. Will in-person retail ever exceed the levels it had before the pandemic despite vacancies prior?
d. How much retail will return, now that consumers have shifted largely to shopping from home?
e. How much tourism will return and when?
f. Rents have been dropping since 2016 and the pandemic has furthered this correction.
g. How long will that remain? Will rents come down low enough to provide affordable housing
without requiring the immense increases in FAR contemplated in the proposal outlined in the
Draft Scope?
h. Would adaptive reuse rebalance the neighborhoods without resorting to what amounts to
developer giveaways and increased building envelopes?
4. Without data based on post-pandemic experience, the answers can only be guesses.
COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND INTERAGENCY PARTICIPATION
ENVISION SOHO/NOHO
1. This section of the Draft Scope describes the Envision process and its goals in detail but completely
disregards the expectation that “these Neighborhood Priority recommendations and corresponding
potential Implementation Strategies...have been developed with an understanding that many areas warrant
further research and community input. (Envision SoHo/NoHo, p.11)”
72. It is a disservice to the entire Envision process to describe its findings as conclusive, when the Report
itself states, “It is emphasized that the provided Potential Implementation Strategies are not definitive.”
3. It is hard to understand how CPC is willing to turn its back on the Report’s findings (p.46) that
continued conversation and aspirational thinking “...is encouraged to further evolve ideas to achieve
effective implementation.”
4. The Plan fails to “maintain, enforce and strengthen existing protections for residents including renters
and those in rent-regulated units (p.7),” one of seven goals in the November 2019 Envision SoHo/NoHo
report. Instead, the conversion from existing M zoning to new R or C zoning will remove protections
directly related to work created and practiced within the unique JLWQA units that were established
specifically for the M1-5A and M1-5B districts. Further, real estate speculation, brought on by upzonings,
is known to increase the instances of harassment aimed at rent-regulated tenants. This is of particular
concern for the numerous senior residents who were part of the pioneering movement that transformed
these neighborhoods and are now aging in place.
5. The Scope should include outreach to the following areas/groups as recommended in Envision SoHo
NoHo (p.84): The Southeast Study Area; younger populations of SoHo/NoHo; workers of SoHo/NoHo;
and other important voices inside and outside the SoHo/NoHo boundaries.
6. The survey of land uses that DCP conducted, which is mentioned on p.5 of the Draft Scope, is not
included.
PROJECT AREA
HISTORIC DISTRICTS
1. This proposal is the first-ever upzoning of an historic district since the creation of the Landmarks
Preservation Commission (LPC) in 1965. If a precedent is set now, the Proposed Actions not only will
have a negative impact on the immediate study area, the proposed actions, but also will have a profound
negative impact on historic districts throughout the city.
2. An action that would potentially damage the character and attraction of all our historic districts and the
tax-base city-wide must not be passed.
3. The assorted FAR increases proposed for within various areas of the historic districts run the risk of
fundamentally altering the neighborhoods, and such proposals are in contradiction to NYC Landmark law
(§ 25301[b]) which notes that the protection and perpetuation of protected districts are “for the education,
pleasure and welfare of the people of the city.”
4. In the historic districts, where upzoning is proposed to be a minimum of 20% (6 FAR), and up to 94%
(9.7 FAR)—and in a few cases 140% (12 FAR)—changes in neighborhood character will be subject
mostly to LPC review. But those big FAR increases will create tremendous incentives for owners to seek
rooftop additions and demolitions, some of which no doubt the LPC will grant. And new development at
that scale will also often be out of scale for the historic districts, where the overall average FAR in both
SoHo and NoHo is below 5.
NEIGHBORHOOD CONTEXT
1. Lifting the 5,000sf limit on restaurants would not achieve the desired goal to “contribute to the charm
and vibrancy of SoHo and NoHo (p.9) or “foster the small business community of SoHo/NoHo...” (p.2).
2. The variety of eating and drinking establishments already in existence in the district is part of the
unique character of SoHo/NoHo and is a differentiator to other parts of the city. The regulations
8restricting their size to 5,00sf were the product of years of consultation and consensus-building by the
community and public officials; that restriction has been critical to protecting the vibrancy, tourism
economy and commercial and residential desirability of the SoHo/NoHo area.
3. Prior to Covid-19, the SoHo/NoHo area was already vibrant, bustling and congested and among the
most popular areas of NYC with tourists, already providing plenty of food and drink options to the
community of residents, workers and visitors all over the area.
4. The outsize scale of eating & drinking establishments of more than 5,000sf would require a level of
commercial delivery, garbage handling and other services that would overwhelm and destroy the
residential life that exists throughout the district.
5. Even the wider street corridors are already very congested and establishments of this size will create
significant adverse effects on noise and congestion levels as well as public safety. (As recently as July 29,
2020 the NY State Liquor Authority voted against an on-premise liquor license application for a food hall
on Broadway for these reasons).
SoHo and NoHo Historic Cores
1. Notwithstanding the Draft Scope’s acknowledgement of NoHo’s and SoHo’s “pervasive mixed-use
character” which “contributes to the charm and vibrancy of SoHo and NoHo and presents unique
conditions related to zoning, land use, and quality of life” (p. 9), the Draft Scope fails to address and
correct the serious quality-of-life problems that mixed-use engenders, and which Envision SoHo/NoHo
strongly recommended be addressed.
2. It is not by chance that “bars and restaurants are interspersed across the project area, but are more
prevalent along Lafayette St., Great Jones St., Bond St., and W Broadway.” For decades, the SoHo/NoHo
community fought successfully to restrict use on the narrower and much more residential streets. The ill-
effects of oversize bars and restaurants is detrimental to the character, the local environment, and the
residential life of these neighborhoods. For the Draft Scope to casually suggest that these uses be
legalized—apparently without restriction as to size—ignores the wishes of thousands of families,
Community Board 2, the NY State Liquor Authority, and local elected officials who feel otherwise. It will
drastically alter the neighborhood character.
3. It is ill-advised to draw a line down the center of any street so that one side is populated with huge
developments facing another side’s “intact historic zone.” As the Draft Scope is currently configured, that
happens in 5+ instances.
Commercial Corridors
Broadway Corridor
1. The Draft Scope states, “The Broadway corridor contains...a high concentration of commercial uses,
particularly offices and destination retail (p.9).” What the document fails to state is that many, if not most,
of these establishments have been operating without proper Certificates of Occupancy for decades, in
clear violation of the law. Indeed, it is these countless violations and lack of enforcement that propelled
the creation of the Envision SoHo/NoHo process in the first place.
2. The Broadway corridor appears to be regarded as a development opportunity without reference to the
current overcrowded sidewalks and congestion in the street, not to mention hazardous crossings and
dangerous turns at intersections.
3. The Draft Scope should take into account the mixed-use character of this corridor and its sizeable
population. According to the Broadway Residents Coalition, the population along Broadway in both
9NoHo and SoHo is comprised of over 750 residential units. Broadway between Canal and Houston Streets
has approximately 57 second-floor JLWQA residential units with many more above.
4. Any proposed actions to address recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic in the Broadway corridor or
anywhere else are premature and must be only tentative at this time.
Bowery Corridor
1. While the Draft Scope describes the SoHo and NoHo historic districts in some detail, it blithely ignores
the historic, architectural, cultural, and commercial significance of the Bowery.
2. Despite the plethora of historic structures that the Bowery is famed for, the Draft Scope’s chief
comment on this subject is, “There are a number of under-built sites, including vacant land, low-rise
tenements, and single-story semi-industrial or formerly industrial buildings.” In fact, in 2013 the Bowery
was placed in the Department of the Interior’s National Register of Historic Places, defined as “the
official list of the Nation's historic places worthy of preservation.”
3. The Draft Scope ignores the monumental structures, the historic buildings, and the cultural history of
this boulevard—the second oldest thoroughfare in the city after Broadway.
4. It seeks to perpetuate the legend of the Bowery as a home to derelicts, both human and buildings, while
ignoring its rich contribution to the city’s streetscape and past.
5. The Bowery historic district extends from Chatham Square in Chinatown to Cooper Square in NoHo. It
contains multiple building styles, including several NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC)
Individual Landmarks, two of which are in NoHo. One, the Bond Street Savings Bank/Bouwerie Lane
Theatre at 330 Bowery, a French Second Empire gem, was among the first Individual Landmarks,
designated in 1967. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.
6. The other Individual Landmark, the Cooper Union, just north of the study area, an Italianate
brownstone and mere feet outside the study area, was deemed a National Landmark in 1961 and an LPC
Individual Landmark in 1965, the same year the LPC was formed.
Canal St. Corridor
1. The Draft Scope states “341 Canal and 419 Broadway, at six and eight stories respectively, are
establishing Canal Street as a gateway to the neighborhood and serve as a transition between SoHo and
the taller commercial buildings south of Canal.”
2. Both these new buildings are planned in accordance with the current 5 FAR, with no request from the
developer for a variance or a special permit, so we question the need now for the added FAR that the
Draft Scope is proposing for the corridor.
SoHo East and SoHo West
1. The Draft Scope states that SoHo East and SoHo West “are generally less residential and less built up
than the other areas described above.” This ignores the scores of East SoHo residents residing at 129
Lafayette St. by Howard St., as well as the countless residents in the crowded tenements abutting
Chinatown, Little Italy and Nolita and the residents in the West SoHo and South Village tenement
buildings.
102. Introducing new housing that is only 20-30% affordable will gentrify these “low-intensity semi-
industrial” areas, increase the cost-of-living for many of these low-income residents trying to eke out a
living, and accelerate their displacement.
E. PURPOSE AND NEED FOR THE PROPOSED ACTION
1. This section references the importance of addressing the needs of the City’s artists and creative
workforce with no supporting plan details.
2. This section takes suggestions for further study from 12 areas for the Envision SoHo NoHo Summary
(see Task 1) and re-purposes them as “community-driven recommendations.”
3. CPC’s specifically excludes from the proposed zoning actions the improvement and support of “public
realm management” (e.g., infrastructure issues). This is contrary to the prominence of that topic during
the professed goals of the 2019 Envision SoHo/NoHo process.
4. “The public realm” (i.e., “quality of life”) is only mentioned once in the entire Draft Scope whereas
Envision SoHo NoHo mentions it 37 times. The Scope must address concern for the resident population
in more detail and propose zoning solutions to address these concerns—not increase them.
REPLACE OUTDATED MANUFACTURING DISTRICTS WITH MIXED USE REGULATIONS
1. The Draft Scope states that the obsolete and onerous current zoning will be replaced with appropriate
and flexible regulations to address the need for expanded as-of-right commercial development balanced
with the need to maintain appropriate residential use, but it does not explain how residential uses would
be protected from commercial expansion or what that balance should be.
2. This section discusses the 74-781 Special Permit process but does not offer any plan to improve and
update it.
3. The Draft Scope makes little mention of 74-711 Special Permits. DCP assumes that all special permits
are onerous and makes no mention of the public benefit of the 74-711, which assures that historic
buildings are maintained in perpetuity.
4. Overreliance on special permits is largely related to UG6 ground floor retail, but the Draft Scope lumps
all UG6 together. Nor does it address the existing 5,000sf maximum, failing to give UG6 eating and
drinking the particular consideration it requires.
5. Of the six key findings of the DCP July 2020 Study, none of them concluded that “outdated regulatory
barriers will only serve to exacerbate the recovery for two of New York City’s most significant
commercial areas.” Nor is there any evidence that these “outdated regulatory barriers” will restrict
recovery post-Covid-19.
6. This DCP study showed 50% vacancies in SoHo NoHo, and data reports by SoHo Business Initiative
on July 30, 2020 reported a 31% vacancy. DCP is now using the uncertainties of Covid-19 recovery to
move quickly ahead with an upzoning. Moreover, it significantly reduced the size of five of the 24
corridors studied in the 2019 storefront vacancy report and excluded the following previously surveyed
streets:
a. Houston Street between MacDougal and Mulberry Streets
11b. Prince Street between Sixth Avenue and Mulberry Streets
c. Broome Street between Sixth Avenue and Mulberry Streets
d. Lafayette Street between Prince Street and Astor Place
e. Centre Street between Canal and Spring Streets
f. Mulberry Street between Canal and Bleecker Streets
7. Canal St. (which, according to the study had a higher vacancy rate on the south side than on the north)
had very high vacancies well before Covid-19 and has been a wasteland ever since Thor, Vornado and
others cleared out all the longtime local businesses that offered all sorts of useful materials and products
as part of a failed effort to turn the Canal corridor into a new retail strip mall.
INTRODUCE RESIDENTIAL USE AND PROMOTE EQUITY IN HOUSING
1. The word “equity” appears only four times in the Draft Scope and no further details to advance the goal
are provided.
2. As our city rebuilds in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic over the coming years, there is the
exciting possibility that New York City will come back stronger, and fairer. How can we ensure true and
lasting equality for everyone? How do we achieve economic justice for all after an economic freefall?
3. The southwestern corner of the project area is slated to be the site of significant residential
development, but it is also one of the most polluted corners of the city. Study how siting affordable
housing at the entrance to the Holland Tunnel contributes to the goal of equity in housing.
SUPPORT ARTS AND CULTURE
1. The Draft Scope describes no detailed plan to maintain the existing JLWQA and rent-stabilized and
rent-controlled apartments, and there is no official count, nor even an estimate, of the number of such
units.
2. The Draft Scope provides no occupation-based restrictions to accomplish the goal of supporting the
artists and makers population.
3. The Draft Scope mentions voluntary transition from JLWQA to residential use but it does not detail
how it would work or how arts and creative uses would benefit.
4. The Draft Scope refers to certified-artist-occupied JLWQA as “the sole as-of-right quasi- residential
use” when in fact, Use Group 17D is very much a real residential option.
5. The Draft Scope states that “only 30% of all SoHo/NoHo homes are still listed as JLWQA use on
Certificates of Occupancy,” but that low percentage is unreliable data, since DOB has increasingly been
dropping the JLWQA annotation. Even the Loft Board is aware of this and intends to address it.
6. The “voluntary option to transition JLWQA to regular residential use with conditions that more broadly
benefit the arts and creative industries” is not only vague and unspecified, but it opens the door to losing a
lot of units that might best be transferred to rent stabilization. Verbiage like this—with no mention of
permanent affordability—leaves the role of the Loft Board in limbo.
7. Instead of converting M districts to UG2, the Scope should study maintaining the M district with
protections and broader allowances for residentially-occupied units. UG2 puts at risk things that the Draft
Scope claims to want to protect.
128. Not-for-profit museums (UG3) should be made as of right.
FACILITATE SUPERIOR URBAN DESIGN AND APPROPRIATE BUILDING FORM
1. The Draft Scope proposes to “facilitate superior urban design,” but it is necessary to precisely
distinguish between the historic effectiveness of the existing urban design (which needs to be protected)
and any necessary updating of the variance and special permit processes (which allow for the engagement
of the community).
2. The Draft Scope discusses deploying “appropriate buildings forms” that “relate harmoniously to the
loft building context.” It is important to explore the dangers of big box retail and new residential projects
with uncharacteristic, out-of-scale FAR.
3. The Draft Scope points out that “existing bulk regulations in M1-5A and M1-5B districts” haven’t
always served the “loft building context.” The fact remains that ill-considered modifications to those
regulations might easily produce far more drastic, if unintentional threats to this national treasure,
especially if explicit limits and cautions are not clearly identified before deciding future changes.
4. The Proposed Actions would establish new bulk and height regulations, and where it is claimed that
these regulations would “minimize the effects of new developments and enlargements on neighboring
buildings,” the DCP must rigorously substantiate this claim so that resulting impacts truly correspond to
promises made.
5. This Draft Scope states the changes would “allow the LPC to shape the building form without the need
for separate land use actions.” This process would bypass community input on land use issues, which
should remain as an important check and balance.
6. There is no analysis regarding the number of LPC applications that will be generated by DCP’s
proposed new maximum FAR.
F. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED ACTIONS
1. The Action’s goal is purportedly to “strengthen SoHo/NoHo as a vibrant mixed-use district and more
inclusive community,” but the challenge remains to ensure that the specific, concrete changes
implemented actually serve that objective.
2. The Proposed Actions correctly support nurturing a “healthy retail ecosystem,” but these districts
already have a successful and unique ecosystem (characterized by small scale diversity and artistic vibe)
whose continuation is valuable in its own right.
3. Retail is in the middle of massive restructuring and national crisis. It seems prudent to proceed
cautiously and not blindly apply once-familiar approaches in a context where they might have major
adverse impacts. This may be the time and special place for truly visionary innovation to be the key to
survival.
4. The last proposed action, “Support arts and culture and creative industries that serve the community
and the public with use allowances and other appropriate provisions,” is yet another example of a bone
that is thrown to the community without a single supporting detail.
13ZONING MAP AMENDMENT
1. The proposed Zoning Map Amendment that establishes the Special SoHo NoHo Mixed Use District
proposes eight new zoning sub-districts with proposed as-of-right use and bulk regulations that allow for
major increases in floor area ratios far in excess of current building bulk and form.
The proposed Zoning Map Amendment increases in FAR are without regard to the unique historical
development pattern of SoHo and NoHo and would create massive, out-of-scale developments throughout
the districts. One example is the projected development at 558 Broadway, where DCP identifies for the
future the construction of a 200’ tall tower due to the granting of over 50,000 SF of new allowable bulk.
Data indicates over a dozen other locations along Broadway with similar additions of new bulk, which
could result in a succession of towers all along Broadway from Canal Street north, despite the DCP’s
November 9, 2020 FAQ that erroneously states the “new rules will not allow tall towers and skyscrapers.”
PROPOSED ZONING DISTRICTS
1. Instead of simplifying regulations and procedures, DCP proposes five new zones, eight new subdistricts
and, in several cases, boundaries for the subdistricts that bisect streets.
2. In the data in Appendix A, there are two lots with M1-6/R10A zoning—a district that is not discussed
or mapped in the Draft Scope.
3. To “achieve the right balance among uses,” the EIS study should investigate/document impact
commercial overlays to limit the possibility of expanded new office construction and to ensure that local
retail uses are incorporated in the plan.
PROPOSED SPECIAL SOHO/NOHO MIXED USE DISTRICT (SNMD)
ZONING TEXT AMENDMENTS
1. CB2, Man. is vehemently opposed to any proposed Zoning Text Amendment that allows--with no
public review process-- retail uses over 10,000sf (including cellar space) and eating & drinking
establishments over 5,000sf.
2. Calculation of FAR in retail establishments should include basement/cellar space.
3. An upzoning of residential FAR need not be a requirement of Mandatory Inclusionary Housing (p. 17).
The Scope should include the study of the potential of adaptive reuse as an alternative to increasing FAR.
SPECIAL SOHO/NOHO MIXED USE DISTRICT AND SUBDISTRICTS (SNMD)
General Use Regulations
1. The Draft Scope states (p. 17): “Within the SNMD, the proposed M1-5/R7X, M1-5/R9X, and M1-
6/R10 districts’ use regulations would apply, with modifications.” The subsequent table, as well as the
proposed zoning map, show these three proposed zonings as well.
2. The two lots in Appendix A with M1-6/R10A zoning are 358 Bowery (DSOW ID 13 and already in
development as an office building) and 350-352 Bowery (DSOW ID 1).
143. The R10A offers bonuses for contextual development and community facilities. Would this be in
conflict with the Mandatory Inclusionary Housing provisions of the proposal or would it be additional
floor area bonus uses to create even larger buildings? Are these two lots on a corner of Bowery or within
100 feet of a corner, in which case they can be even taller? This should be clarified.
4. Allowing “UG 10 retail uses such as department stores over 10,000zsf” as-of-right flies in the face of
Envision SoHo NoHo, which specifically recommended maintaining the 10,000zsf cap (Envision SoHo
NoHo, 3.1).
As-of-right Use Group 10 is also inconsistent with the second goal of the report, to “foster the small
business community” as noted on p. 6 of the Draft Scope. Existing and new small businesses will need
additional protections.
5. If Use Group 10 retail uses are to be permitted as-of-right, where are the provisions for the protection
of residents, such as enforcement of the loading berths requirement and restriction of delivery hours?
6. SNMD should provide protection for arts-related and creative-industry ground floor spaces, such as
showrooms and galleries, which would face increased financial pressures caused by loosening the zoning
regulations to retail uses and would have a negative effect on neighborhood context.
Joint Live-Work Quarters for Artists
1. JLWQA is inadequately addressed in the Draft Scope. Despite accounting for 30+% of residential units
in SoHo and NoHo (per p.31, Envision SoHo/NoHo Report), there are no details regarding either the
preservation or the legalization of these residents. This was a topic of extreme importance during the
Envision SoHo/NoHo process.
2. The Draft Scope allows for voluntary transition from Use Group 17D JLWQA to Use Group 2, but
does not define the details of the “mechanism” and related costs for doing so. Such conversions must
result in no loss of tenant rights protections.
3. There are no guidelines or timeline for transitioning UG 17D JLWQA with permanent affordability to
Use Group 2 nor are there any provisions for protecting JLWQA units in IMD buildings in limbo.
4. The Scope needs to study alternatives to JLWQA and do research into expanding the definition of
“artist.”
5. The Draft Scope’s modifications of FAR prioritize big box retail over small businesses and office use
over housing.
6. What provisions will the SNMD include to govern “JLWQA, arts and cultural uses, and conversions of
existing buildings (p.17).”
7. The Draft Scope does not explain what would become of the Loft Law process nor does it offer a single
detail regarding how “the mechanism would be paired with conditions that support arts and culture and
establishments that broadly benefit the community and the public.”
8. “The voluntary transition from UG 17D JLWQA to UG2 residential with expanded home occupation
provisions” sounds like an update of live/work but would result in the loss of many affordable units that
would otherwise be transitioned into rent stabilization.
9. It is not clear if the City would propose amnesty to non-certified artists living in JLWQA units as it did
in 1987 (“Non artist Tenants Grandfathered in SoHo and NoHo, NY Times, Aug. 30, 1987) and noted on
p. 5 (2nd para) of the Draft Scope or if the current permitted uses under M-zoning will continue to be
permitted.
15Non-Residential Floor Area Retention
1. Why will the proposal will require a developer to replace any commercial space lost to residential
conversion with an equal amount of new commercial space? And will this cause displacement of the
existing commercial tenants?
2. Despite the current glut of office space, the Non-Residential Floor Area Retention modification
incentivizes office use, not adaptive reuse, and is inconsistent with the Draft Scope’s objectives.
3. Retention Modification may also disincentivize residential development and conversions, which
contradicts the Draft Scope’s objectives to “expand housing opportunities” and “promote adaptive reuse
of existing buildings by allowing for the conversion of existing buildings (p. 2).”
4. DCP (RWCDS Table 3) shows 75 Spring St. (DSOW 31(CV), 154 Grand St. (DSOW 32(CV)) and 324
Lafayette (DSOW 28 (CV) as projected development sites with conversion from office to residential, and
no office retention. For those in the historic core, DCP grants a FAR allowance that does not line up with
the historic core subdistrict allowances.
5. The Retention Modification also requires the Chair of the CPC to certify that the amount of non-
residential floor area in a building will be replaced at a one-to-one ratio with future non- residential uses
on the zoning lot, but this certification is not subject to public review and adds a new city approval for
each project even though the Draft Scope seeks to reduce the number of applications and approvals.
6. Existing office buildings offer an opportunity for adaptive re-use. This proposal discourages this
possibility, but should be more open to investigating its utilization, as REBNY is proposing for Midtown.
7. Conversions to residential within existing buildings, many of which are grossly overbuilt, will
complicate as-of-right conversion to residential without special rules.
Floor Area and Bulk Regulations
1. Two subdistricts—the Broadway-Houston Corridor and NoHo North—would permit full lot coverage
up to two stories, instead of the 70% and 80% permitted for interior/through and corner lots respectively
under R9X zoning. This will negatively impact light and air for buildings that share a rear lot line.
2. Many buildings in the area have 2nd floor residential occupancy, and there is no indication that DCP
has taken this into consideration.
MANDATORY INCLUSIONARY HOUSING (MIH) PROGRAM
1. If the maximum additional MIH FAR is built across SoHo and NoHo, it will add nearly 11 million new
square feet of new housing: the equivalent of four Empire State Buildings, 12 Woolworth Buildings or 90
NOMO SOHO Hotels.
2. Nothing in the MIH program guarantees that any housing will be built. It would be helpful to see a
report on successful MIH programs.
3. There are strong incentives for office and dormitory use.
4. The pre-Covid-19 luxury condo glut will temper any business decisions to build new housing—both
luxury and affordable.
165. The special permit process for developers with “hardship” cases will undermine the creation of
affordable units.
6. New, as-of-right residential development, with mandatory inclusion of affordable housing could be
accomplished with less disruption and no upzoning at the same FAR as is currently allowed for
commercial/manufacturing development in SoHo.
7. This would be particularly feasible if, as is suggested on p. 19, the text amendment were to “provide for
some adjustments to make the existing MIH program work for conversions in SoHo and NoHo.” It also
does not describe these adjustments nor explain how they would apply to office buildings undergoing a
conversion or redevelopment, given the proposed requirement to maintain non-residential floor area.
8. Chief among these adjustments would be requiring lower income levels and a higher percentage of
residences reserved for the required affordable housing.
9. Subsidies should be provided to ensure the development of affordable housing, with greater subsidies
for those developments with a higher percentage of affordable housing.
10. A set-aside for some percentage of the required affordable units in new residential developments
should be considered for those in the maker and creative arts and industries.
11. Developments should consider dedicated arts-production space in new developments, especially in
those where the unit size is 850sf.
12. If commercial FAR is raised to 10 and residential FAR is only 12 for MIH, the meager difference will
disincentivize residential development. The Scope should examine the effect of no upzonings for
commercial use.
13. DCP’s proposed zoning text amendment would allow for off-site, low-income housing when less than
25,000sf of housing is developed. This creates an opening for developers to do enlargements of existing
historic buildings, creating a windfall for developers who can add luxury penthouse units, and not have to
provide any onsite affordable housing.
14. The proposed Affordable Housing Fund allows developers to apply to BSA for a “special permit” to
reduce their payment into the Fund where requirement would make development “financially infeasible.”
Isn’t one of the goals to reduce the number of special permits? Would this be a public process?
15. What are the criteria for which the BSA would grant this exception?
16. How will the DEIS define and calculate “financially feasible”?
17. The Scope needs to include a description of how the Affordable Housing Fund will work. Since 2016,
how much money has been paid into this fund and where and how has the money been spent?
18. A loophole allows payments into an Affordable Housing Fund in lieu of building the housing in the
proposed area, defeating the stated goal. This loophole must be closed.
19. It is unclear who determines the amount a developer pays to the Affordable Housing Fund? The
developer? The DCP? The City Council? Is this amount based on the project’s “financial feasibility”?
1720. Exempting “developments, enlargements, or conversions that do not exceed either 10 units or
12,500zsf or residential floor area from the requirements of the program” may be shortsighted, given the
scale of many of the smaller buildings in SoHo/NoHo.
21. As a market-driven program, MIH program is unlikely to produce neither the number of AH units
required to make a difference nor provide housing at the AMIs most needed by our city’s vulnerable
populations.
22. In addition to the three zoning districts described, in the data in Appendix A, there are two lots with
M1-6/R10A zoning: 358 Bowery (DSOW #13 and already in development as an office building) and 350-
352 Bowery (DSOW #1). The R10A offers bonuses for contextual development and senior facilities.
Would this be in conflict with the Mandatory Inclusionary Housing provisions of the proposal or would it
be additional floor area bonuses to create even larger buildings? This should be clarified.
23. The Scope needs to explain how Covid-19 and a recovery whose details are impossible to predict
would affect the number/percentage of projected development sites legitimately be able to apply for this
exception?
WRP REVIEW PROCESS AND DETERMINATION
1. According to New York City’s Zoning & Land Use Map, the entire southern boundary of the SNMD
going as far east as Greene St. and as far north as Dominick St. is in the floodplain.
2. Building to the specifications of the City Planning’s Zoning for Coastal Flood Resiliency program in
the M1-6/R10, M1-5/R9X, and M1-5/R7X areas is going to be an added cost to developers.
G. ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK
REASONABLE WORST-CASE DEVELOPMENT SCENARIO
1. What and whose assumptions about the future “financial feasibility” will the DEIS model use to
forecast the “No Action condition” and the “With Action condition” analysis in the 10-year time-frame
(2021-2031)?
2. What happens if Covid-19 continues and/or worsens the current economic downturn? Will the RWCDS
model’s financial and economic assumptions be changed “mid-stream” to reflect the reality of a
significant delay in the financially feasibility to absorb the “build-out” commercial and residential square
footage assumed in the model?
3. What assumptions are reasonable for a 10-year period in light of Covid-19 and the yet- undetermined
economic recovery, given the office space glut; the historical reliance on tourism spending and the fact
that 2019 tourism levels might not return for many years; the pre-Covid-19 luxury condo glut, only
worsened by Covid-19; and overleveraged retail landlords hurt by pre- Covid-19 retail rent drops and
post-Covid-19 empty offices and lack of tourists, particularly foreign tourists who tend to spend more?
THE FUTURE WITHOUT THE PROPOSED ACTION (NO ACTION CONDITION)
1. The Draft Scope assumes that in a No Action condition, residential conversions and conversion of
former industrial space to commercial uses would not occur and CPC discretionary actions and BSA
variances would not be obtained. Even with a conservative environmental analysis, given the heavy
calendar of the CB2 Land Use committee, it is hard to imagine that these actions would cease to be
applied for and (and usually granted).
18THE FUTURE WITH THE PROPOSED ACTION (WITH ACTION CONDITION)
1. There are no projected development sites located within the Canal Corridor (Subdistrict 4), making
evaluation of the effects of the proposed action on the Canal Corridor impossible, according to the
methodology set forth by the Draft Scope. Similarly, there are no potential development sites located
within the NoHo–Bowery Corridor (Subdistrict 1), SoHo East (Subdistrict 3), or SoHo West (Subdistrict
8). Only a single projected development site is located within the NoHo Core (Subdistrict 6): DSOW 14:
53 Bond St. This is not a sufficient number of sites for the analysis framework.
2. Two of the six Proposed Development Sites that are within the SoHo Core (Subdistrict 7) incorrectly
identify M1-5/R9X as the proposed zoning: DSOW 31(CV) – 75 Spring St.; and DSOW 32(CV) – 154
Grand St. They should be M1-5/R7X.
3. Potential Development Site W – 92 Prince St., which is within the boundary of the Broadway–Houston
Corridor (Subdistrict 5), is incorrectly identified as M1-5/R7X. It should be: M1-5/R9X with
modifications.
4. The following projected sites have distinctions not reflected in the Draft Scope that should be studied:
a. Site 1 (350, 352 Bowery) is listed on the National Registry of Historic Places in the Bowery
Historic District. It has transferred air rights for 2.0 FAR to 358 Bowery.]
b. Site 2 (30 Great Jones St – block 531, lots 17, 52, 56) is located wholly within the NoHo Historic
District.
c. One of the tax lots in Site 3 is in fact only 1000sf, so it does not meet the criteria for a
development site, but Site 3 consists of two lots joined together so as a whole site 3 is above the
1700sf limit. The two are also directly above the Lafayette/Broadway subway station.
d. Site 12 (410 Lafayette St) is located wholly within the NoHo Historic District.
e. Site 13 (358 Bowery) is currently undergoing active construction and does not meet the criteria for
a Projected Development site. It is listed on the National Registry of History Places within the
Bowery Historic District.
f. Site 15 (281 Lafayette St) is listed on the National Registry of Historic Places within the
Chinatown/Little Italy Historic District.
g. Site 16 (81 Mercer St) is located wholly within the SoHo-Cast Iron Historic District and is
occupied by an existing building, so does not meet the criteria for a Projected Development site.
h. Site 23 (72 Grand St) is located wholly within the Soho-Cast Iron Historic District. It has
additionally undergone multiple discretionary reviews by the LPC and most recently came before
CB2 in Sept., 2020, seeking an application to construct a four-story commercial building.
i. Site 24 (217 Hester St) is listed on the National Registry of Historic Places within the
Chinatown/Little Italy Historic District.
j. Site 27 (114 Baxter St) is listed on the National Registry of Historic Places within the
Chinatown/Little Italy Historic District.
k. Site 30 (324 Lafayette St) is located wholly within the NoHo Historic District.
l. Site 31 (75 Spring St), a purported conversion site, is located wholly within the SoHo- Cast Iron
Historic District Extension. It is already overbuilt to a FAR of 9.85, exceeding the maximum
allowable FAR in an R7X zone.
m. Site 32 (154 Grand St) is located wholly within the SoHo-Cast Iron Historic District Extension.
5. The following Potential Development Sites have distinctions not reflected in the Draft Scope that
should be studied:
a. Site BB (686 Broadway) has transferred air rights for 10 FAR to 684 Broadway and should not be
considered a development site.
19b. Site BBB (146 Spring St) is among the oldest buildings in SoHo, built in 1819; was reviewed by
CB2M in April 2004 (LPC Item 9); and should not be considered a development site.
c. Site EEE (403 Lafayette St) is adjacent to an individual LPC Landmark, the Merchant’s House.
d. Site HH (102 Greene St) was involved in a discretionary review by the LPC and granted a CPC
Special Permit in Feb 2010 (ULURP 080260ZSM), and thus should have been excluded from the
development scenario.
e. Site J (27 East 4 St) is adjacent to an individual LPC Landmark, the Merchant’s House. It
underwent discretionary review by the LPC in 2018, and most recently came before the CB2
Landmarks Committee on Dec. 10, 2020, seeking an application to demolish an existing one-story
garage and construct a new building. Accordingly, it should not be considered a development site.
6. The proposed R10 zoning drives the RWCDS, but may not produce the projected housing. The city’s
assumption that the vast majority of development will be for residential use, 84% of projected GFA, may
be unrealistic given that R10 zoning allows 10 FAR for commercial uses without any MIH subsidy.
7. There is already current glut of luxury condos.
8. There is a trend for property owners to build office space in lieu of housing in nearby Hudson Square
and 550 Washington, including new headquarters for Disney and Google.
9. “One entirely non-residential building is projected in the western portion of the project area near
Hudson Square, another strong office market”: That site is at the northeast corner of Grand St. at Sixth
Avenue and is owned by Trinity Church Real Estate and is shown as #22 on the Projected Map/List. The
Scope should explain why new FAR will be allowed on that site but housing is not required.
10. What is the basis of the conclusion that “a substantial portion” of the 1,683 DUs are “expected to be
affordable”?
GENERAL CRITERIA FOR DETERMINING DEVELOPMENT SITES
1. The Scope needs to explain why the lot area threshold was set at 1700sf or larger to guide where
development can reasonably be expected to occur.
2. Much of the area has been landmarked going back to 1973, but the Landmark Districts were only
cursorily mentioned.
3. There is only a very brief mention of rent-stabilized tenants in buildings of six or more residential units.
The proposal claims that these sites should be excluded from the development scenario because of the
expense of relocating the residents. This category requires deeper analysis, due to the number of buildings
in SoHo/NoHo of this size. Has CPC determined the impact of any residential displacement from the
development of projected and potential sites?
According to the Loft Board, there are currently 475 units in 331 buildings under their control. The DEIS
must study stabilized IMD tenants covered under Loft Laws and rent- stabilized affordable housing
programs including as JLWQA.
PROJECTED AND POTENTIAL DEVELOPMENT SITES
1. More than half of the GFA of the 27 projected development sites (or 1,942,995sf) will benefit five
property owners:
20a. Edison Properties’ two parking lots account for 397,836 sf, or 20% of the GFA, and the Appendix
shows that these sites would contain medical office space and a grocery store;
b. Alexander Chu/Centre Plaza LLC and Stellar Management and City Urban Realty buildings
account for 279,798sf or 14% of the GFA;
c. Diehl Realty’s SoHo parking garage accounts for 138,794 sf or 7% of the GFA, which per the
Appendix shows would contain a grocery store under the city’s plan;
d. Lots owned by Yee Tai and The Kaufman Organization are expected to account for 133,184sf or
7% of the GFA; and,
Park-It’s garage accounts for 93,383 sf or 5% of the GFA and community facility space, plus
Park-It owns two parking garages on the potential development site list, accounting for another
172,542 sf.
2. In light of a more favorable federal administration, has CPC reevaluated the redevelopment potential of
2 Howard Street, a federally-owned parking garage with a lot area of 12,716sf, which at 12 FAR could be
redeveloped for more than 144,000sf and 100% affordable housing, while maintaining parking for
government vehicles?
3. In light of the near-term prospects for substantially built office buildings and hotels, has CPC explored
the purchase of distressed assets to be redeveloped as 100% affordable and/or supportive housing?
Projected Development Sites
1. The DEIS needs to analyze sites that might be developed after 10 years, including 57 Potential
Development Sites that are assumed to be “less likely to be developed” within 10 years, and all other sites
in the study area impacted by the proposed zoning changes. (Under CEQR Technical Manual guidelines,
potential sites are only analyzed in the DEIS for “site-specific effects such as potential noise impacts,
effects on historic resources and the possible presence of hazardous materials,” (Draft Scope, p. 24). As a
result, the Draft Scope vastly underestimates the impact of the proposed upzoning on historic districts
because it excludes all site located within historic districts, other than vacant lots, solely because these
sites are “subject to LPC review and approval.”
2. Per the Draft Scope, lots of highly irregular shape would be excluded because of the difficulty of future
as-of-right development; because such lots are more costly and more difficult to build on; and because
they do not produce marketable floor space. The CB2 Land Use committee sees applications for
development on such types of lots on a regular basis and for this reason, DCP must study irregular lots in
the DEIS/Scope.
3. In fact, several of these sites already have plans for development. Owners of two underutilized sites, 61
Spring St. and 134 Wooster St., listed by DCP as “Potential,” have already applied to the City to construct
commercial structures on their lots. Nearby, on just one block of Prince St. between Greene and Mercer
Sts., 105 Prince Street, a two-story building housing the Apple store with a 6,000sf footprint; 110 Prince
St., a recently constructed one-story retailer; and 92 Prince St., another recent one-story mercantile
structure yearning to increase in height and bulk, will surely attract developers seeking to enlarge them
along this busy thoroughfare.
4. Why is a garage at 349 Canal St. (DSOW ID DDD) and an abutting building excluded from projected
development when many similar sites are included for study?
5. Although DSOW ID 23 is indicated as being Vacant Land (land use 11), 72 Grand St. was, in fact, until
recently a standing one-story cast-iron building in the Soho-Cast Iron Historic District that had had the
upper four floors destroyed by fire.
21DEVELOPMENT SCENARIO PARAMETERS
1. In these sections, the parameters for development (small units, low floor- to-ceiling heights, small floor
plates) all but eliminate the possibility of any future affordable housing for any artist or live-work
situations, further eroding the identity of SoHo and NoHo.
2. These parameters are also a complete repudiation of any attempt to “accommodate and expand live-
work” (last bullet, p.2), or “create housing and live-work opportunities” (third bullet, p.7) or “support and
promote and create more spaces and uses for arts, maker uses and cultural uses.” (last bullet, p7)
3. The lots for development include lots now dedicated to commercial uses with very few residents. The
DEIS/Scope must study the projected increase in residential population of almost 50%, which will create
the need for new infrastructure for a significantly expanded population. The area does not have the
infrastructure to support this change in residential population, and if history is any guide, the City will not
provide that infrastructure in a timely, systematic, or thorough manner. We have clear instances of such
failure in our own community board.
4. Why does the Draft Scope assume that development sites will exclude “government facilities, utilities,
large institutions, homeless shelters, and houses of worship” even though the study says that since these
facilities are often under-built? In light of all the efforts to redevelop these types of sites around the City,
it seems naïve to exclude them.
Dwelling Unit Factor
1. Does establishing a size of 850sf per unit support the stated goal of the Neighborhood Plan to
“accommodate and expand live-work uses and supporting creative, arts and cultural uses”? (p.2)
Floor-to-Floor Height Conversion Prototypes
1. According to the DCP map, Conversion Prototype 75 Spring St. is in the Historic Core with the lowest
FAR change (M1-5/R7X), but in Appendix 1, it is part of the calculation for the Broadway Commercial
Corridor (M1-5/R9X), which has highly increased FAR. At its existing 9.85 FAR, 75 Spring is either
overbuilt by 4 FAR (M1-5/R7X) or by 1.85 FAR (M1-5/R9X). Any claim of affordable housing at that
location will have to be subtracted from DCP's affordable housing total.
Development within Historic Districts on Projected and Potential Sites
1. Because all three proposed “representative examples” of prototype conversion are all within a stone’s
throw of each other (154 Grand, 75 Spring, 324 Lafayette), they are hardly “distributed across the project
area.”
2. All three are landmarked.
APPENDIX 1
1. These three tables are unreadable, and need to be reformatted (offered in some downloadable format) in
larger type to be accessible to the general public for whom they are intended.
2. There is data/information in the Appendix that is not referenced in the text of the Draft Scope, which
increases the lack of transparency of the spreadsheets—and clouds the intent of the Draft Scope itself.
3. Projected Development Sites: The following discrepancies in Appendix 1 should be studied:
a. Site 1 (350, 352 Bowery): FAR of 2; PLUTO data reports FAR of 3.00.
22b. Site 3 (315 Lafayette, 301 Mulberry): FAR of 1; PLUTO data reports FAR of 1.56.
c. Site 4 (155, 159 Grand St): FAR of 2; PLUTO data reports FAR of 5.53.
d. Site 7 (381, 383 Canal St): FAR of 3; PLUTO data reports FAR of 3.82.
e. Site 8 (126 Lafayette, 257 Canal St): FAR of 2; PLUTO data reports FAR of 2.55.
f. Site 9 (239, 243 Canal St, 3 Howard St): FAR of 3; PLUTO data reports FAR of 3.48.
g. Site 13 (358 Bowery): FAR of 0; PLUTO data reports FAR of 0.58.
h. Site 20 (356 West Broadway): FAR of 3; PLUTO data reports FAR of 3.97.
i. Site 25 (123 Lafayette): FAR of 4; PLUTO data reports FAR of 5.35.
j. Site 27 (114 Baxter): FAR of 5; PLUTO data reports FAR of 5.98.
k. Site 30 (324 Lafayette): FAR of 5; PLUTO data reports FAR of 6.17.
l. Site 31 (75 Spring St): FAR of 8; PLUTO data reports FAR of 9.85. It is in the historic
core, so its actual FAR is 5.
m. Site 32 (154 Grand St): FAR of 5; PLUTO data reports FAR of 5.94
4. Potential Development Sites: The following discrepancies in Appendix 1 should be studied.
a. Site AA (382 West Broadway): FAR of 2; PLUTO data reports FAR of 2.90.
b. Site BB (686 Broadway): FAR of 2; PLUTO data reports FAR of 2.94.
c. Site EEE (403 Lafayette): FAR of 2; PLUTO data reports FAR of 2.84.
d. Site FFF (90 Grand St): FAR of 4 PLUTO data reports FAR of 6.04.
e. Site GGG (96 Spring St): FAR of 7; PLUTO data reports FAR of 8.02.
f. Site MM (53 Mercer St): FAR of 2; PLUTO data reports FAR of 3.44.
g. Site W (92 Prince St): FAR of 1; PLUTO data reports FAR of 2.36.
h. Site WW (518 Broadway): FAR of 1; PLUTO data reports FAR of 4.48.
i. Site Y (424 West Broadway): FAR of 2; PLUTO data reports FAR of 2.78.
j. Site YY (118, 120 Prince St): FAR of 1; PLUTO data reports FAR of 1.89.
k. Site Z (396 W Broadway): FAR of 2; PLUTO data reports FAR of 2.85.
5. Include in the DEIS/Scope an accurate building-by-building analysis that corrects the many errors in
the DSOW list with regard to building typologies, heights and size, so that an accurate analysis of the
proposed actions’ potential adverse impacts on the existing built conditions within the SNMD can be
completed and alternates can be considered that will provide a range of building height caps more
appropriate to their immediate surroundings.
6. Include in the DEIS/Scope an accurate building-by-building analysis that correctly quantifies the
amounts of existing retail, commercial, manufacturing (including JLWQA) and residential uses so that the
CEQR analysis will truly reflect the proposed actions’ potential adverse impacts on the existing character
of SoHo and NoHo.
PROPOSED DRAFT SCOPE OF WORK FOR THE EIS
Task 1: Project Description:
This task should describe “the background and/or history of the project” and detail “key planning
considerations that have shaped the current proposal.” The tasks for study in the DEIS should include the
recommended study items from “Envision SoHo/NoHo: A Summary of Findings & Recommendations.”
They are taken from the Report below verbatim:
IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE
1.1A: Further research the specificity of SoHo/NoHo’s mixed-use nature and schedule needs for curb
access with the objective to make deliveries more efficient
23ENCOURAGE NEIGHBORHOOD DIVERSITY
2.1B:
• Study the implications of the Housing Stability and Tenant Protections Act of 2019 and if/how it
interacts with rent regulations within Loft Law provisions.
• Work with State elected officials to explore measures to implement and enforce anti- harassment
procedures based on the newly passed rent law.
2.1C: It is recommended that Process Sponsors study the feasibility of implementing such rental
assistance for low-income artists and other renters.
2.2A: Consider a potential expansion of live-work definition that reflects current and future trends, which
should be further studied and identified.
2.2B: Exact mechanisms and use classifications of the framework presented remains unclear and would
require further study.
2.2C: Study new affordable housing that is targeted to artists and is conducive to arts production in the
context of fair housing laws and broader concerns over housing equity.
2.2D: Additional research to create a new entity outside DCLA to review the eligibility and connect
individuals with benefits/resources to detail further how such an entity might be established, how it would
function, and how it would improve the ability to administer eligibility standards without being overly
exclusionary.
2.2E:
• Explore how legislative efforts could be made to implement property tax breaks and
• other mechanisms to support existing artists and to encourage arts and making in new
• “live-work” units that accommodate a broader range of cultural workers.
• Explore mechanisms to incentivize shared work and/or exhibition space for artists and
• makers as provisions in new developments or residential conversions.
• Explore ways to establish productive relationships between local non-profits and the
• business community to encourage and formalize support the local arts and cultural
• programming.
• Explore opportunities to connect property owners with efforts seeking to create
• temporary programming/ studios in empty commercial spaces.
• Explore opportunities to create a “Made in SoHo/NoHo” branding campaign and encourage
retailers to commission designs from SoHo/NoHo artists and makers, with possibly a portion of
sales of such goods used to support local arts and culture in the neighborhood.
2.3B: Study local non-profits in efforts to help artists and others find affordable housing, live-work space,
or general work space.
2.3C: Explore opportunities to create design guidelines, with assistance and input from LPC based on the
study area’s character, to ensure future development will be physically and architecturally contextual with
existing built environment.
24PROMOTING ECONOMIC VITALITY
3.1A: Study how to allow a wider range of compatible ground floor uses that balance mixed-use
neighborhood blocks and examine a wider range of compatible uses, traffic patterns, sanitation efforts,
and a retail study. Efforts would include the involvement of the business and residential communities.
3.1B: It is recommended that further research study the following:
• The appropriate parameters for allowing hybrid/complementary uses, including consideration of
the type, size, operations, and land use compatibility.
• How hybrid uses might be viable in a continually evolving local economy, as they become
established and potentially seek opportunities to grow.
3.1C: Further research and a coordinated effort with the community is recommended to create general
guidelines and potential subareas for the expansion of such uses.
3.2A: It is recommended that community groups and the City further research advantages that a cultural
arts district designation might provide for SoHo/NoHo. Such a designation may more broadly enhance
community identity and affirm local heritage.
3.2B: The planning process also revealed that there are opportunities to update use regulations in ways
that consider the expansion of arts and maker uses. The City should consider this as an area requiring
further analyses.
3.2C: Private landlords should be encouraged to “activate” vacant properties during interim occupancy
periods for artistic, micro-manufacturing and cultural uses. Currently, artistic and cultural uses are not
permitted as-of-right and an allowance for such uses would remove zoning violations and fines that are in
place. It is recommended that the City further explore the feasibility of such an initiative by further
contemplating two provisions: the involvement of well- suited local partners and non-profits to help with
monitoring, and the potential role of philanthropy and incentives to help fund such an endeavor.
3.2D: Additional consultation with relevant agencies and organizations is recommended, in light of their
expertise of artists’ workspace needs, to study new live-work typologies and configurations that are
responsive to today’s generation of artists and makers.
3.2E: Study the feasibility of implementing such tax incentives for these causes and further investigate
other financial support mechanisms that could be utilized.
3.3B: Investigate the feasibility of encouraging affordable rent options specific to such uses.
3.3C: Work with Small Business Services (SBS), Chambers of Commerce, BIDs and merchants’
associations to better understand small business’ challenges in SoHo/NoHo, and connect them to
resources.
Task 2: Land Use, Zoning and Public Policy
1. A thorough understanding via a detailed economic analysis should be conducted on all areas and
properties that may be afforded additional development rights through increased FAR to properly
calculate the value of the economic development conferred and the impacts of transferable development
rights.
252. Study the potential impacts of the Proposed Actions on land use, zoning, and public policy, but beware
the methodologies presented in the CEQR Technical Manual. The Municipal Art Society of New York’s
recently released the report, A Tale of Two Rezonings: Taking a Harder Look at CEQR, exposes the
shortcomings of the existing environmental review process through the lens of two recent rezonings in
Long Island City (2001) and Downtown Brooklyn (2004).
3. The report demonstrates CEQR’s failure to predict the type and scale of new development that its
zoning changes will stimulate and studies the resulting impacts on open space, transit congestion, school
seats, and other measures of livability.
4. Chief among the findings of the MAS Report is CEQR’s to take into account the cumulative effect of
many small, individual acts. “From school capacity, to open space, to traffic congestion, to affordable
housing, the CEQR process has produced mitigation plans that have no bearing on the ultimate needs of
these neighborhoods. Residents have been left to shoulder the burden of these miscalculations,” said
Elizabeth Goldstein, President of MAS. MAS points out that decisionmakers need, and New Yorkers
deserve, an environmental review process that does more than disclose limited and illusory outcomes
from the City’s zoning changes.
5. MAS proposes a series of improvements across eight categories of reform, including consideration of
potential zoning lot mergers, increasing the range and scope of alternatives, making use of General
Environmental Impact Statements to assess a wider range of potential outcomes, and requiring the
implementation of mitigation measures before receiving Certificates of Occupancy.
6. “These neighborhoods [in Queens and Brooklyn] were transformed by an explosion of high- end, high-
rise residential development, fueled—unintentionally—by the City’s zoning changes. Demographically,
they are now whiter, wealthier, and more crowded than ever.” (MAS, A Tale of Two Rezonings: Taking a
Harder Look at CEQR)
7. Study the feasibility of the purchase of distressed buildings by the City (by eminent domain, etc.)
8. Include the survey of land uses that DCP conducted, which is mentioned on p.5 of the Draft Scope but
is not included.
Task 3: Socioeconomic Condition
1. During the City’s October 26, 2020 Zoom presentation, it admitted that it has not performed the
necessary studies to investigate potential for displacement within the study area. Direct Residential
Displacement is a chief concern. The Plan will increase vulnerabilities of approximately 1,500 rent
stabilized units, including more than 500 in the R10 “housing opportunity” subdistricts, and more than
400 IMD Loft Law units that have not yet been converted to rent stabilized status under current law. This
brings into question the City’s assumption that there will not be direct displacement of more than 500
residents, and its claim that the SoHo/NoHo rezoning “would not typically be expected to alter the
socioeconomic characteristics of a neighborhood (p.27).”
2. Study the following items across the entire Study Area:
a. Value of FAR by square foot, for each individual property.
b. Costs of LPC applications, due to enlargements etc., rising from the increased FAR. C
c. Transferable Development Rights, all possible scenarios.
d. Costs applicable to residentially occupied units due to the proposed conversion from
manufacturing use to residential use (now described, without specifics, as a “mechanism”).
e. Costs of newly-allowed SLA applications, per removal of existing zoning boundaries.
26f. Costs related to the Affordable Housing Fund and how that could apply for existing residentially
occupied buildings, as well as for new developments.
3. The analysis projected for the levels of displacement of owner and renter occupied residential units and
existing manufacturing and retail establishments does not include current housing costs for units that
would be displaced and salaries for jobs that would be lost. Alternatives should be developed for
replacement of displaced units and jobs, which are essential to protect the existing socio-economic
character of SoHo NoHo.
4. Investigate the character and size of the various “employment hubs” in the project area before positing
any assumptions about displacement.
5. Recalculate the resident and worker assumptions Table 2 was based on, in light of Covid-19.
6. Reach out to the following areas/groups as recommended in Envision SoHo NoHo (p.84): the Southeast
study area; younger populations of SoHo/NoHo; workers of SoHo/NoHo; and other important voices
inside and outside the SoHo/NoHo boundaries.
7. Study the effect on JLWQA residents who might be displaced during the transition from UG17D
JLWQA to UG2.
8. Data gathered by the Broadway Residents Coalition indicates approximately 750 rent- stabilized units
in and around the three Housing Opportunity Areas will be affected, and greater than 1500 units within
the study area. Quantify and analyze the direct effect of that across the Neighborhood Plan.
9. Study the effect of upzoning on the southeastern and southwestern corners of SoHo with respect to
displacement and the economy.
10. Indirect Business Displacement: The DEIS study should investigate/document effects of potential
commercial displacement to be caused by elimination of existing commercial spaces caused by
conversion in the light of pandemic and post pandemic office market.
11. Include additional data on the breakdowns, locations and rental/ownership of floor area within the
study area occupied by the artistic/creative/“maker” communities so that the CEQR analysis discloses any
potential adverse impacts on these SoHo/NoHo communities and appropriate and equitable provisions can
be developed to provide for their retention in the SNMD.
12. So that equitable provision can be made to provide for their retention in the SNMD, analyze the
available zoning and governmental support programs used in conjunction with other City programs to
support the retention or availability of both residential and work space for New York’s cultural, artistic
and “maker” communities (e.g., Westbeth, Manhattan Plaza, Special Midtown District, Special 125th
Street District, Governor’s Island) as potential mitigation for displacement of these communities created
by the proposed actions.
13. Identify and analyze potential adverse impacts on the current built environment within the SNMD,
with particular attention to the necessity for specialized SNMD text governing conversions to MIH floor
area, especially in existing overbuilt noncomplying buildings.
27Task 4: Community Facilities and Services
1. Public Schools:
a. As a result of Covid-19, public schools were closed after March 13, 2020 through the end of the
2019-20 school year; opened nearly a month late in Fall 2020 and then closed after just seven
weeks, creating a crisis in providing education to all students, but particularly students with
disabilities, English Language Learners and students living in temporary housing.
b. Consequently, how could you accurately quantify current utilization; assess the need for more
school facilities for social distancing; or forecast demand for public school seats until schools fully
and safely reopen, not to mention the need to address the increase in population?
2. Libraries and Childcare Centers
a. If the population increases by 41% (Table 2, p. 22), study the impact of the increase on libraries
and childcare centers.
Task 5: Open Space
1. The upzoning is expected to increase the SoHo and NoHo population from 7800 to 11,011 (an increase
of 3,211 residents per Table 2). Demand and use of open green space have increased during Covid-19 and
“proven that parks are essential infrastructure.” Under the CEQR Technical Manual, the broader “NoHo
Neighborhood” is the only downtown neighborhood that the NYC Department of Parks and Recreation
defines as underserved by open space.
2. Meanwhile, SoHo and NoHo remain significantly underserved by open space, with an open space ratio
of only 0.08 acres per 1,000 residents, as compared with the City’s planning goal of 2.5 acres per 1,000
residents.
3. The addition of open space at the E. Fourth St. and Grand St. water tunnel sites would only increase the
open space ratio in SoHo and NoHo to 0.09 acres per 1,000 residents, still well below the City planning
goal.
4. Study accompanying any increase in FAR with an increase in open space, either in the form of
additional physical open space or contributions to an Open Space Fund that would be used within CB2.
Such a fund would be formed to provide the active and passive forms of recreation to the level of the
City’s planning goals. It would be formed and administered by the City and used to add either one or
more recreation centers (like the Tony Dapolito Recreation Center) designed and sized to serve the
increased population of SoHo and NoHo as a result of the proposed actions.
Task 6: Shadows
1. Study the effect of shadows on typical loft buildings with large windows and artists’ studios.
2. Study the potential for all new or redesigned buildings (not just buildings over 50 ft.) to cast shadows.
3. Study the loss of sky if FAR is increased.
4. Study the effect of shadows from new or redesigned buildings on the current open spaces.
285. Study the effect of shadows on historic buildings with ornamentation that will be obscured and
compromise the look and feel of the historic districts.
Task 7: Historic and Cultural Resources
1. Standards should be established for new construction that maintain the integrity of the street walls that
constitute the urban form of the historic districts. The projected analysis includes an examination of
historic and cultural resources within the study area, but it does not address all the impact of new
construction in the historic districts. The Landmarks Preservation Commission does not usually rule on
the height and bulk and setbacks and open space of new buildings. This could result in development that
is out of scale with existing historic buildings.
2. The DEIS Scoping document should investigate/analyze the impacts and additional impacts of the
zoning recommendations on the SoHo-NoHo plan, and in particular the area between Bleecker and Spring
and Mercer to Crosby St. Fifty-two and a half percent of all buildings were built prior to 1939. As a result,
the majority of existing buildings were built to full lot dimensions, and a significant number with through-
lot configurations. This building-to-building density has, and will continue to be, an impediment in
configuring and regulating the crucial infrastructure adaptations necessary for increased density within the
built environment.
3. Study the archaeological history of this area and the importance of preserving any remaining artifacts.
In the 1640s, a New Netherland community known as the “Land of the Blacks” encompassed what today
are SoHo, NoHo, Chinatown, Little Italy, and Greenwich Village. Black land ownership continued into
the time of New York City. From 1643-1716,130 acres+ were owned by free Black men and women in
what is now the neighborhoods of Soho and NoHo, including Bond Street, Bowery and Lafayette.
4. Study the danger of demolition of old buildings and the approaches for protecting them.
5. Study the danger of demolition and construction on sites that are immediately adjacent to individual
landmarks, as is the case for Site EEE (403 Lafayette St.) and Site J (27 E 4 S.t).
6. Study the impact of the proposed actions on tourism and real estate values as the connection to the past
is weakened by the proposed actions.
7. Study the short- and long-term impact on the Landmarks Law if it is modified to suit political demands
and not cultural, educational or history needs.
8. Study the effects of a surge of new construction within historical structures.
9. Investigate/document the impact of maker economy give-backs within the scope of this zoning
proposal as in similar subsidized artist housing and performance spaces (Governor’s Island, Westbeth).
10. The DEIS study should investigate/document effects and costs of development of older, historic
buildings in their feasibility analysis. SoHo and NoHo M1-5B District is largely a historic district: 5,619
units were built prior to 1939 [source 2014-2018 American Community Survey]. For this reason, the
feasibility of adding MIH units or even new development under this zoning will be severally affected by
the age and historic underpinnings. Added to this is a building stock that has virtually no separation –
even rear yards in most places, especially the commercial corridors. These factors will impact costs of
29new buildings and the ability to include MIH in the mix. In fact, it could encourage non-residential
development or produce another wave of BSA applications based on hardship not dis-similar to those
experienced over the last 15 years.
Task 8: Urban Design and Visual Resources
1. The description of this task states that “an assessment of urban design and visual resources is
appropriate when there is the potential for a pedestrian to observe, from the street level, a physical
alteration beyond that allowed by existing zoning.”
2. DCP should study the well-established precedents demonstrating that additional FAR has harmful
impacts on an altered streetscape and that the City has rightfully acted in the past to prevent such damage.
3. DCP avoids the fact that, besides building on underutilized sites, property owners will surely take
advantage of increased FAR to add bulk on top of existing landmarked buildings, forever changing the
streetscape, view corridors and character of the historic districts, along both Broadway and Lafayette Sts.
as well as the side streets. This rooftop scenario actually occurred in 1998 when property owners
uncovered a zoning loophole that saw at least seven rooftop additions constructed contrary to the zoning
intent. When New Yorkers complained about the harmful impact, the City Council quickly amended the
Zoning Resolution to remove this loophole.
4. This task states that “for the projected and potential development sites, the analysis will focus on
general building types,” but in this case, most of the affected and adjacent study area is landmarked. The
LPC does not normally approve “general” building types. Instead, it demands buildings of a higher
quality, often with expensive details and materials not found in cookie- cutter “general” structures. The
pressure will be formidable on LPC to approve generalized building plans submitted by developers to
counter their financial deficits that building below- market housing generates. This would result in
undistinguished edifices detracting from neighborhood masterpieces.
5. Study the difference in terms of landmarking between With Action and No Action, which will see the
historic districts’ skyline utterly altered from the historic built-context that has long been in place—a
context that draws countless visitors to marvel at the special character of the area.
6. If the zoning is changed to these three districts, the pedestrian experience will gradually become as
follows (from the NYC Zoning Handbook): RX9 is described as producing “the taller, bulkier 16- to 18-
story apartment buildings characteristic of Chelsea and Murray Hill in Manhattan.” “Much of Midtown,
Lower Manhattan and major avenues in Manhattan, as well as parts of Downtown Brooklyn and Long
Island City, are mapped at R10 density.” “R7X districts are mapped along major thoroughfares in Harlem
in Manhattan and Jackson Avenue in Long Island City in Queens.”
7. Study how increases in height and density will increase wind.
8. Study if bulk, form and scale will comply with residential standards.
9. Study how the proposed actions might adversely impact opportunities for expansion and/or conversion
of already overbuilt, noncomplying buildings to residential use.
10. Analyze the proposed actions’ potential adverse impacts on the current and future supply and
affordability of the existing stock of JLWQA and residential space within the study area.
30Task 9: Natural Resources
1. Study how the streams in the Canal St. area will affect new construction.
2. Study how new construction in the Canal St. area will affect the stability of adjacent old buildings,
given the network of underground waterways.
3. Study the issue of the subsoil, particularly in the M1-5B district, which is wet. A new building on the
corner of Greene and Canal was forced to build out of steel, as opposed to poured concrete, and took more
than 3 years to complete at the current FAR.
Task 10: Hazardous Materials
1. Study the environmental effect of the old gas works in the area of the Edison parking lot in southeast
SoHo.
Task 11: Water and Sewer
1. According to New York City’s Zoning & Land Use Map, the entire southern boundary of the SNMD
going as far east as Greene St. and as far north as Dominick St. is in the floodplain.
2. Study the effect of flooding and the effect of climate change on wastewater and stormwater
infrastructure.
3. Identify and analyze the proposed actions’ potential adverse impacts on the currently well- established
unstable ground, subgrade water and storm and sewer drainage conditions within SoHo and NoHo, with
particular emphasis on the potential adverse impacts on existing historic properties of excavations and
foundations for new construction within the SNMD.
Task 12: Solid Waste and Sanitation
1. Study how deliveries and pickups will be affected by the lack of loading berths and storage if, as
predicted by the report, increased residential creates 50 additional tons of waste per week.
Task 13: Energy
Task 14: Transportation
TRAVEL DEMAND AND SCREENING ASSESSMENT
1. Study traffic at more times of day than just peak hours. A great variety of different activities occur in
the neighborhood at many times of day.
2. Study more transportation modes than just automotive, transit and pedestrian. Need to include bicycles,
e-bikes and other micro-mobility modes.
TRAFFIC
1. Selection of study locations needs to be based on not only ""the assignment of project generated traffic
and the CEQR Technical Manual, but also in consultation with the community (CB2, block associations,
BIDs, businesses, etc.) based on frequent observations.
2. The generation of 50 or more additional vehicle trips in any peak hour needs to be considered in the
context of how traffic can be reduced from its current state. In addition, there are side streets in the area
that are frequently inundated by automotive traffic and need to be studied along with the key corridors.
313. Nine days of continuous ATR counts will help supplement data collection at peak hours, but will not
adequately reflect conditions that occur frequently at non-peak hours, which should be included, because
of the varied activities occurring in these neighborhoods at different times of day. What is needed are
accounts of routine users and inhabitants who regularly observe and experience conditions, which can be
achieved by incorporating questionnaires/surveys and interviews.
4. A truck trip generation forecast alone doesn't address the already highly negative truck impacts. Create
a management plan.
5. The influence of the Covid-19 pandemic must be taken into account, i.e., the atypical conditions that
exist because of the pandemic don't reflect what traffic conditions will be once there is a return to normal,
i.e., to a stabilized situation. The study should be based on pre- Covid-19 figures (applied as existing
conditions, rather than what currently exists) which reflect ""No Action"" more accurately.
6. Regarding mitigation, Vision Zero has introduced a new outlook on how traffic functions with
alternative modes, new street geometries and varied curb uses that need to be considered, rather than just
the traditional approaches.
TRANSIT
1. Study Transit using pre-Covid-19 figures, which present a more realistic picture of what can be viewed
as base conditions.
2. Study problems posed by nearby subway lines for 20+ projected and potential sites.
3. Although there is attention to conditions at subway stations, there is no consideration of the impact on
subway cars (e.g., crowding estimates) i.e., the proposed actions will have an impact on the system, not
just stations.
4. There have been gaps created in bus service in the SoHo area with the restructuring of bus routes such
as the M1 which eliminates a central route for SoHo, a dearth that calls for remediation. Spacing of bus
stops, trip frequency and seating opportunities also need improvement. These types of already existing
problems need to be part of the analysis.
5. Problems exist concerning access for the bus going down Broadway, which is often blocked by
stationery tourist buses and slowed down by traffic congestion. This needs to be considered.
PEDESTRIANS
1. Little attention is paid to examination of the latest alternative transportation approaches to creating
more space for pedestrians and making the pedestrian environment safer, more comfortable and
accessible. The formulaic approach of the CEQR Technical Manual is no longer enough to ascertain
impacts which should be assessed based on actual pedestrian needs in action and an already existing lack
of needed pedestrian facilities.
P ARKING
1. Study how using parking lots/facilities for development of residential buildings could lead to increased
demand for on-street parking, which isn't even currently available. This needs to be assessed, as does the
impact on the environment and traffic movement of increased cruising for parking spaces.
2. Of the 27 proposed development sites seven are parking lots or garages [DSOW 2, 10, 12, 16, 20, 22:
marked as land use 10; DSOW 21: marked as bldg. class “Fireproof” but in fact a parking garage].
32However, the No Action condition shows only 39,000 gsf of parking area, which upon inspection is solely
attributable to the site at 356 West Broadway.
3. An additional five Proposed sites contain parking for at least 228 cars, according to their certificates of
occupancy.
4. Using the DCP’s assumption of 300 sq ft of parking per vehicle, 228 cars accounts for 68,400 gsf of
parking. As some of the certificates of occupancy state “at least” x number of vehicles,
this is a lower limit.
5. Additionally, DSOW 22 represents 4,484 gsf of parking area, according to the tax lot’s land use
classification as a parking facility.
6. Taking into account the additional gsf of parking lot area, Table 2, the No Action Condition,
undercounts the Other Commercial (Parking) category by at least 72,884 gsf, as well as the Total
Commercial subtotal by that same amount.
7. The Population figures Table 2, according to the standard industry rates of 1 employee per 1,000 sf of
other commercial, also undercounts the number of Workers by 73 employees.
8. Accordingly, the net change, or Incremental condition, in Table 2 should state a loss of - 111,884 gsf of
Other Commercial (Parking) and -124,392 gsf of Total Commercial space. Additionally, the net change of
Workers should be -182 workers.
Task 15: Air Quality
1. Study how proximity of the Holland Tunnel affects air quality.
2. Study how the poor air quality will affect the equity position of this location.
Task 16: Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Climate Change
1. Study the New York City Zoning & Land Use Map to see how the entire southern boundary of the
SNMD going as far east as Greene St. and as far north as Dominick St. is in the floodplain.
2. Study how building to the specifications of the City Planning’s Zoning for Coastal Flood Resiliency
program in the M1-6/R10, M1-5/R9X, and M1-5/R7X areas will affect construction costs.
Task 17: Noise
1. Study how the noise from retail deliveries to Big Box stores will affect life for residents if the
population of SoHo/NoHo increases by almost 50%.
Task 18: Public Health
Task 19: Neighborhood Character
1. Study the effect on neighborhood character of building the equivalent of four Empire State Buildings,
12 Woolworth Buildings or 90 NOMO SOHO Hotels (Crosby St. size), if the maximum additional MIH
FAR is built across SoHo and NoHo.
332. Study the effect on neighborhood character of the impact of increased FAR inside the historic districts
and outside the historic districts, which is different because of the mitigating effect of LPC oversight.
3. Study the impact of proposed actions on the defining features and human scale of the project area.
4. Study the adaptive reuse of existing buildings that preserved neighborhood character and was
responsible for the area’s renaissance in the 1970’s.
5. Coordinate with City and State agencies to do a comprehensive inventory—by both quantity and
type—of all types of affordable housing in the project area.
6. Study how the limits of the three proposed zoning districts will change neighborhood character. NYC
Zoning Handbook: RX9 is described as producing “the taller, bulkier 16- to 18- story apartment buildings
characteristic of Chelsea and Murray Hill in Manhattan.” “Much of Midtown, Lower Manhattan and
major avenues in Manhattan, as well as parts of Downtown Brooklyn and Long Island City, are mapped at
R10 density.” “R7X districts are mapped along major thoroughfares in Harlem in Manhattan and Jackson
Avenue in Long Island City in Queens.”
7. A detailed analysis must be conducted to show how the Proposed Actions will impact and negatively
affect the defining features of the neighborhoods’ character. The Draft Scope notes that projects that make
substantial alterations to the scale of the streetscape may require a detailed analysis.
8. For example, in NoHo, a 20,000 square-feet parking lot on Lafayette and Jones Streets is located within
the proposed M1-5/R9X area. According to DCP’s own website, the Proposed Actions could produce a
tall, bulky, twenty-story high-rise apartment building characteristic of Chelsea and Murray Hill—although
it sits in the median-rise NoHo Historic District Extension. Such an edifice will result in a dramatic and
harmful impact on the historic district.
Task 20: Construction
1. Identify and analyze the proposed actions’ potential adverse impacts on the currently well- established
unstable ground, subgrade water and storm and sewer drainage conditions within SoHo and NoHo, with
particular emphasis on the potential adverse impacts on existing historic properties of excavations and
foundations for new construction within the SNMD.
Task 21: Mitigation
Task 22: Alternatives
1. Analyze alternates to the Proposed Actions that will not increase the existing FAR within the historic
districts and alternates that satisfy MIH requirements through development of off-site affordable units
and/or affordable units located outside the SNMD.
2. Include in the DEIS an accurate building-by-building analysis that corrects the many errors in the
DSOW list with regard to building typologies, heights and size, so that an accurate analysis of the
proposed actions’ potential adverse impacts on the existing built conditions within the SNMD can be
completed and alternates can be considered that will provide a range of building height caps more
appropriate to their immediate surroundings.
34Task 23: Summary Chapters Task 24: Executive Summary
Therefore, be it resolved that no Scope or DEIS compiled during the global upheaval of a pandemic
could possibly be an accurate assessment of any neighborhood.
Be it further resolved that CB2 urgently recommends that DCP examine the shortcomings of the draft
scope of work as outlined above and present to CB2 for further review a new draft scope of work that
rectifies those shortcomings plus reflects the impact of the pandemic on the residential, commercial and
retail sectors of our economy.
Be it further resolved that this new draft scope be presented to CB2 for public review before any
ULURP is begun.
Be it finally resolved that CB2 recommends that DCP study and offer affordable housing alternatives to
Mandatory Inclusionary Housing (such as new, more targeted, zoning tools and an expanded review of
adaptive reuse) and study and offer the minimal modifications to the existing M1-5A/B zoning that would
be required to achieve the primary goal of affordable housing and small business survival without
increased FAR.
Vote: Passed with 45 Board members in favor and one abstention (B. Kubovy-Weiss).
LANDMARKS AND PUBLIC AESTHETICS
FIRST LANDMARKS MEETING
1. 61 Seventh Ave. So. - The application is to install an ADA required ramp.
(laid over)
2. 14 Gay St. - Application is to restore the facade and roof and reconstruct stoop, and iron work in
historic design.
(laid over)
3. 27 E. 4th St. - Application is to demolish an existing one-story garage and construct a new building.
Whereas:
A. The Merchant’s House Museum (Tredwell House), adjacent to the property at the east, is a significant
and fragile individual landmark with both the exterior and the intact original interior designated; and
B. Existing garage is non-historical and undistinguished and CB2 Manhattan previously recommended
approval for demolition to the Commission; and
C. The site was originally occupied by a row house of a similar design to the Merchant’s House Museum
adjoining the property; and
D. The proposed building is six stories with a seventh-floor setback and the front facade has substantial
steel columns with modern black metal and glass infill with transoms; and
35E. The height, 94’-5” to the roof and 112’-5” to the top of the mechanical equipment, overwhelms the
Merchant’s House and does not provide a suitable intermediate transition in height from the house to the
building at the west of 27 East 4th Street; and
F. The building is 90’-1” deep with a two-story extension at the rear extending to the north property line
and an approximately three-story high wall overlooking the Merchant House garden; and
G. The facade is in brick with a terra cotta “screen” design dividing the four windows and covering the
bottom of the windows on the second through sixth floors and repeated in an obtrusive horizontal cornice
at the sixth floor with no historical context; and
H. The facade brick is a historical design, turning to utilitarian brick with punched lot-line windows on
the east facade which overlooks and dominates the Merchant’s House; and
I. The required extension of chimney flues from the Merchant House are enclosed within the proposed
building; and
J. The applicant provided drawings and testimony concerning steps that are proposed with the
construction intended to provide safeguards against structural movement up against the Merchant’s
House, however they did not make any provision for the securing of the interior of house itself and its
contents during the construction and no proof was provided that the house would not suffer damage,
especially to the irreplaceable decorative plaster under the proposed plan; and
K. The Merchant’s House Museum is a well-preserved building from 1832 and is the only nineteenth-
century family home in New York City preserved intact — both inside (including intricate original
decorative plaster) and out; and
L. The building is a New York City individual landmark for both its exterior and interior and is listed on
the New York State Register of Historic Places and National Register of Historic Places; and
M. The exterior masonry walls, lathing, decorative plaster and woodwork are organically interconnected
and any disturbance to one part would adversely affect the whole and especially the fragile plasterwork;
and
N. Monitoring would be ineffective by providing limited protection - once sufficient disturbance
activates the monitors, damage to both the structure and the interior finishes would potentially have
already occurred; and
O. There was no corroborated persuasive testimony from the applicant that the demolition of the existing
building and the construction of the proposed building would not do irreparable harm to the exterior and
interior of a fragile individually landmarked building; and
P. There was no assurance or provision that the garden and garden wall, an integral to the historic design
of the property, would not be undermined and the high wall to the west is higher that the existing wall of
the garden and would harm its open feeling; and
Q. The director of the museum has estimated that the cost to secure the building, store its contents,
compensate for lost revenue, and carry on the administrative functions of the organization is
approximately $5,000,000; and
36R. A prior application for a similar smaller building on this site was recommended for denial by CB2,
Man. and was denied by the City Council; and
S. There was no testimony from the public in support of the application; and
T. There was extensive testimony, oral and written, from the Director of the Merchant’s House Museum,
its counsel, and others associated with the museum in opposition to the application, both from an aesthetic
perspective and due to the inevitable harm that would come to the exterior, interior and to the garden; and
U. Approximately 60 members of the public, including a member of the Tredwell family, spoke or sent
correspondence to the Board opposing the application; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends denial of the application that, with its excavation,
construction, appearance, and bulk would cause irreparable aesthetic and structural harm to the
Merchant’s House Museum, an individual exterior and interior landmark.
Vote: Unanimous, with 46 Board members in favor.
4. 49 Grove St. – Application is to restore the façade.
Whereas:
A. An extensive analysis of the existing condition has been carried out; and
B. There is considerable deterioration of brick and bluestone and a moderate amount of deterioration of
cast stone throughout the facades; and
D. Where possible, original materials, especially decorative cast stone elements, will be used; and
E. Care will be taken that replacement for original materials is closely matched to the original materials;
now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends approval of this restoration using salvaged
original and matching replacement material.
Vote: Unanimous, with 46 Board members in favor.
5. Consideration of a letter of support for the designation of 50 West 13th St. as an individual
landmark.
Whereas:
A. A request has been made from Village Preservation to support their initiative concerning the
designation of 50 West 13th Street, which has housed the 13th Street Repertory Theatre since 1958, for
designation as an individual landmark; and
B. The theater is among the few original Off-Off Broadway theaters which still survives, and over the
years has been a great incubator for cultural innovation, and
37C. The theater has been an important cultural asset to Greenwich Village which has nurtured actors,
playwrights, designers, and technicians who make important contributions to the American theatre; and
D. The designation of the building as an individual landmark would honor the critical cultural history of
Greenwich Village and New York, as well as ensure the preservation of a more than 173-year old
structure which is already an unofficial local landmark, now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. supports the proposed landmark designation of 50 West 13th
Street, home of the 13th Street Repertory Company theatre, and will send a letter of support for this
designation to the Landmarks Preservation Commission.
Vote: Unanimous, with 46 Board members in favor.
SECOND LANDMARKS MEETING
1. 310 Spring St. and parcels to the north and south – The application is to restore 310 Spring St.
and to connect two new buildings on either side of the property with a 10 story corridor and construct a
lobby and private outdoor space on the 310 Spring St. lot.
Whereas:
A. 310 Spring Street (Dennison and Lydia Wood House), is an individual landmark built 1819 and
modified with the early addition of a third-floor story, the conversion of the ground floor to a storefront,
and an extension; and
B. The house retains a large amount of original material in the front façade and is among the few
remaining houses of the era in the Hudson Square neighborhood; and
C. The front façade is to be restored, including new material of the same kind to replace the existing
material where necessary, installation of a historic design door and restoration of the display shelf, and
installation of shutters shown in a historic photograph in the storefront; and
D. The ground floor will be used as a part of the residential unit occupying the entire building; and
E. The undistinguished rear extension, represented by the applicant as being modified and of poor
construction, is to be demolished; and
F. No assurance, supported with an engineering report, was given that the structure of the house would be
protected with the extensive excavation beneath it in connection with the adjoining buildings and
proposed construction of the new buildings and construction in the garden of the house; and
G. The ground floor rear façade is solid brick with no windows and the upper two floors have historic
windows and shutters and are blocked with masonry; and
H. The rear “garden” is to be occupied by a lobby on the ground floor level, common space in the cellar, a
10-story glass structure enclosing a corridor connecting buildings from the non-landmarked property on
the north and south sides of the lot and an outdoor space for use by the new building’s tenants; and
38I. The use of the storefront as residential space will necessarily afford an artificial appearance and
together with blocking of windows on the rear facade and the absence of windows at the ground floor
reduces the house to a token Potemkin Village structure and greatly harms its historical character; and
J. The two new buildings “squeeze” the landmarked house visually and the glass corridor building on the
landmark lot overwhelms the house with a glass wall to be illuminated day and night; and
The proposal, in effect, cuts the lot in two portions at the rear of the house and gives over the “garden” to
the corridor structure, lobby, and outdoor space for the new construction flanking the lot; and
K. The taking of landmark property for use by the applicant to enhance two properties separated by the
landmark property is a burden that the landmarked property does not need to bear, does harm to the
concept of landmarks preservation, is without precedent and is unacceptable; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends:
• Approval of the restoration of the front facade; and
• Approval of the demolition of the rear extension; and
• Denial of the blocking of rear windows, the rear ground floor design without historic windows
and doors, and
• Any intrusion above, at or below grade by any construction that is not a part of the house or a
historic extension.
Vote: Passed, with 45 Board members in favor, and 1 in opposition (D. Diether).
QUALITY OF LIFE
1. Newsstand Application: Mohammed F. Uddin, d/b/a N/A, 11 E. Houston St. SEC of E.
Houston St. and Broadway, 10012 (5090-2020-ANWS)
Whereas, the applicant wishes to operate a 12 foot by 5-foot newsstand licensed from the City’s street
furniture vendor, JCDecaux; and
Whereas, the newsstand is to be located in front of the newly constructed building at 11 E. Houston St.,
between Broadway and Crosby St., which currently houses a small HSBC location on the ground floor;

2. Resolution in response to the Department of City Planning (“DCP”) proposed Zoning Text
Amendment, Zoning for Coastal Flood Resiliency (“ZCFR”), which would amend and update Article
VI, Chapter 4 of the NYC Zoning Resolution, “Special Regulations Applying in Flood Hazard Areas,”
and Article VI, Chapter 2 of the NYC Zoning Resolution, “Special Regulations Applying in the
Waterfront Area.”
Whereas:
Background & History
1. Manhattan Community District 2 (“CD2”) is a coastal district, with over a mile of waterfront
along the Hudson River, stretching from Canal Street to West 14th Street;
2. A significant percentage of CD2’s residents and built environment are located within NYC’s 1%
chance and 0.2% chance floodplains, as defined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s
(“FEMA”) 2015 Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps (“PFIRM”) and FEMA’s 2007 Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, including:
\
a. as of the 2010 census, a population of 5,000 residents in the 1% chance floodplain and a
population of 10.2k residents in the 0.2% chance floodplain;
b. 346 buildings (7% of all buildings in CD2) and 4,490 dwelling units (8% of all units in
CD2) located in the 1% chance floodplain;
c. 777 buildings (15% of all buildings in CD2) and 7,620 dwelling units (13% of all units in
CD2) located in the 0.2% chance floodplain.
3. There is a scientific consensus that sea levels will continue to rise globally due to climate change,
with the latest report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projecting a rise in sea levels
of between 30cm – 110cm (11.8in – 43.3in) by 2100, depending on greenhouse gas emissions;
4. A continued rise in sea levels as projected by the scientific community is likely to cause the size of
the 1% and 0.2% chance floodplains within CD2 to increase in the coming decades;
5. CD2 was impacted by Superstorm Sandy in 2012, with a portion of the district being flooded,
resulting in extensive property damage to buildings including the West Village Houses and the
landmarked Westbeth Artists Housing, as well as the flooding of the Holland Tunnel;
https://communityprofiles.planning.nyc.gov/manhattan/2#floodplain
6. Following Superstorm Sandy, DCP implemented two Zoning Text Amendments, the 2013 Flood
Text and the 2015 Recovery Text, which were intended to eliminate conflicts between the Zoning
Resolution and regulations governing flood-resistant construction in NYC Department of Buildings’
40(“DOB”) Appendix G of the NYC Building Code, thereby helping to remove regulatory barriers to
reconstruction of storm-damaged properties as well as to the retrofitting of existing buildings, and to help
ensure that new buildings could be constructed to be more resilient;
7. The 2013 Flood Text and the 2015 Recovery Text were both adopted on an emergency, temporary
basis, were not subject to environmental review, and are set to expire in the next few years, with the 2013
Flood Text expiring within 1 year of the adoption of new FEMA PFIRMs, and the 2015 Recovery Text
having already expired in July 2020, thus creating the need for a more permanent Zoning Text
Amendment;
Overview of Proposed Zoning Text Amendment
8. The proposed Zoning Text Amendment would apply to both buildings and lots within the 1%
chance and 0.2% chance floodplains, as opposed to buildings in the 1% chance floodplain only in the
2013 Flood Text, thereby anticipating the expansion of the NYC floodplain in the future due to climate
change;
9. The proposed Zoning Text Amendment would continue to provide additional building height
where building owners are required or are opting to meet DOB Appendix G floodproofing standards, to
allow building owners to physically elevate habitable spaces and other building support features above
expected flood elevations, with the continuation and amendment of various provisions in the 2013 Flood
Text and 2015 Recovery Text, including:
a. continuing to allow building height to be measured from the Flood-Resistant Construction
Elevation (“FRCE”), which is defined as equivalent to the Design Flood Elevation (“DFE”) in the
1% chance floodplain (same as in 2013 Flood Text) and 2’ above the lowest adjacent grade in the
0.2% chance floodplain (new addition);
b. continuing to allow building height to be measured from a “Reference Plane” as an alternative to
measuring from FRCE, but redefining the Reference Plane to a maximum of 10’ above grade for
the 1% chance floodplain or 5’ above grade in the 0.2% chance floodplain;
c. allowing building height to be measured from a Reference Plane above FRCE only if the first
finished floor above the level to which the building complies with flood-resistant construction
standards (defined as the “First Story above Flood Elevation”) is placed at or above such
Reference Plane height, which was not required under the 2013 Flood Text;
d. continuing to allow minimum base height to be measured from either the curb level or reference
plane, as measuring from the curb would allow setbacks to be made closer to the ground and keep
base heights lower;
e. modifying underlying dormer allowances, which permit 60 percent of building width as a
permitted obstruction in the building setback above maximum base height, but diminishing in
width as the building rises, to provide an alternative allowance for a dormer that extends up to 40
percent of the building with no diminishing, which could result in breaking up bulk in the upper
portion of the building.

https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/plans-studies/flood-resiliency-update/project-description.pdf
4110. The proposed Zoning Text Amendment would continue to incentivize ground-floor floodproofing
while allowing for accessibility, promoting active street level use, and maintaining streetscape design,
with the continuation and amendment of various provisions in the 2013 Flood Text and 2015 Recovery
Text, including:
a. allowing both new and existing buildings to exempt wet-floodproofed spaces from floor area, as
compared to the 2013 Flood Text which only applied to new buildings;
b. modifying floor area incentives to better encourage dry-floodproofing in Commercial Districts and
c. M1 Districts paired with Residence Districts, while setting design requirements for those using the
dry-floodproofing floor area exemption, with the goal of maintaining retail continuity along
commercial streets;
d. continuing to allow access to be exempted from floor area when located below FRCE, though
modifying the cap from the 2013 Flood Text;
e. providing greater street wall flexibility to accommodate access, flood panels and streetscape
regulations for buildings in zoning districts that require street walls to be located within 8’ of the
street line;
f. requiring blank walls created along retail corridors to be subject to streetscape rules, to be
addressed by adding elements such as planting, street furniture or artwork;
g. expanding the range of design options available to comply with streetscape rules.
11. The proposed Zoning Text Amendment expands the range of zoning rules which can be modified
by the Board of Standards and Appeals (“BSA”) to facilitate resiliency improvements in special
situations;
12. The proposed Zoning Text Amendment continues provisions from the 2013 Flood Text allowing
for new and existing buildings to increase bulkhead dimensions in order to facilitate the movement of
mechanical equipment to the roof;
13. The proposed Zoning Text Amendment would allow for the second story of buildings to be used
for non-residential uses across all commercial districts, when located in a floodplain;
14. The proposed Zoning Text Amendment expands upon the 2013 Flood Text which allowed for the
deployment of temporary flood panels, by continuing to allow flood panel deployment and additionally
providing for a minor floor exemption for flood panel storage, while also allowing landscaped berms and
floodgates in the same open areas;
15. The proposed Zoning Text Amendment provides greater flexibility for the grading of waterfront
yards and visual corridors to enable the design of soft shorelines and bi-level esplanades, in order to allow
public waterfront access while also providing for flood resiliency;
16. The proposed Zoning Text Amendment attempts to remove regulatory obstacles to recovery from
future flood events and other disaster types, through provisions including:
a. allowing all buildings to place power systems, including emergency generators, as permitted
obstructions in open areas, provided size limitations are met;
b. clarifying the floor area exemption for mechanical equipment;
c. permitting ramps and lifts for all building types in any required open areas.
4217. The proposed Zoning Text Amendment prohibits new nursing homes and restricts the enlargement
of existing nursing home facilities within the 1% floodplain and within other designated areas where
vehicular access would likely become limited during a disaster;
18. The proposed Zoning Text Amendment provides for a series of Recovery Provisions, including
rules that could facilitate the recovery process from physical disasters (e.g. hurricanes) as well as a wider
range of non-physical disasters (e.g. pandemics), and could be implemented in the event of a future
disaster via a text amendment;
19. In the event that Recovery Provisions are activated during or following a disaster, such provisions
are intended to be based on the specific types of impacts caused by such disaster and to apply only to
“Designated Recovery Areas”, which would be selected based on the breadth and severity of the impacts
as well as recovery plans, and are intended to be in effect on a temporary basis, determined at the time of
the activation of such provisions, and subject to Community Board review at that time;
20. The proposed Zoning Text Amendment seeks to immediately put into effect two of these
Recovery Provisions in the context of the current Covid-19 pandemic, with the entire city being set as a
Designated Recovery Area, and which would relate to CPC Special Permits / Authorization Timeframes
and Discontinuance of Non-Conforming Uses, and would remain in effect for a period of two years
beyond the expiration of the Mayor’s Executive Order 98 (March 12, 2020);
21. A range of other provisions are included within the proposed Zoning Text Amendment which are
applicable to lower-density residential communities, or other special situations, with less relevance to
CD2;
Analysis and Specific Applicability to CD2
22. The proposed Zoning Text Amendment is not intended to account for funding for the retrofitting
of existing buildings to be more resilient or the inclusion of resilient features in new construction, though
building owners could potentially realize monetary incentives for such construction in the form of lower
flood insurance rates;
23. The proposed Zoning Text Amendment, while attempting to incentivize the retrofitting of existing
buildings, describes changes that are optional and does not require mandatory changes to be made to
existing buildings, notwithstanding the fact that DOB Appendix G requires existing buildings with
“substantial damage” or making “substantial improvements” to elevate all habitable spaces above DFE;
24. A portion of the FEMA 1% chance and 0.2% chance floodplains overlaps with landmarked
historic districts within CD2, including landmarked blocks in the Greenwich Village Historic District
north of West 11th Street and west of Greenwich Street; the Weehawken Street Historic District; portions
of the Sullivan-Thompson Historic District between Prince and Watts Streets; portions of the Gansevoort
Market Historic District below 14th Street; and portions of the Soho Cast Iron Historic District between
Broome and Canal Streets; as well as individual landmarked buildings outside of these historic districts;
25. Retrofitting of existing buildings within a historic district would still be subject to review by the
Landmarks Preservation Commission, which could impose additional requirements in contrast to what
would be permitted under the proposed Zoning Text Amendment, with the potential to result in more
difficulty in retrofitting landmarked buildings, notwithstanding the option to pursue a variance with the
BSA as outlined in whereas #11 above;
4326. Per DOB records, around 20 new building permits and 40 alternation permits have been issued
within CD2’s floodplain since the implementation of the 2013 Flood Text;
27. The implementation of floodproofing measures in certain buildings is not expected to have any
measurable impact on the behavior of floodwaters during a coast storm inundation scenario;
28. DCP has performed extensive outreach to the NYC community on the topic of Zoning for Coastal
Flood Resiliency in the years following Superstorm Sandy, including 110+ outreach events with
approximately 2500 NYC residents and stakeholders engaged;
29. The proposed ZCFR is only one component of the city’s broader strategy around NYC’s resiliency
to coastal flooding, which includes other measures such as building up coastal defenses and protecting
critical infrastructure.
Therefore, be it resolved that:
1. Community Board 2 (“CB2, Man.”) generally supports the implementation of the proposed
Zoning Text Amendment, though with certain proposed changes as outlined below, as a positive
step to allow businesses and residents more flexibility in preparation for future storm surge and
flooding events, as well as in the ability to recover from such events, especially as such events
may become more likely in the future due to climate change.
Be it further resolved that:
2. In order for building owners to fully take advantage of the proposed Zoning Text Amendment and
retrofit their buildings for resiliency, CB2, Man believes a robust funding program would be needed;
3. To this end, CB2, Man. encourages the City to explore the viability of various options to provide
funding for resiliency-focused retrofitting / building improvements, which could include, among other
things, continuing to advocate to the state and federal government for direct grants and/or subsidies to
home and business owners making such improvements;
4. Though direct funding to building owners should be the first consideration, CB2 also encourages
the City to study additional indirect means to support retrofitting, including tax incentives or the
implementation of Property Assessed Clean Energy and Resilience (“PACER”) programs which could
potentially allow for property owners to borrow against anticipated future savings on flood insurance;
5. CB2, Man. encourages the City to further study the magnitude and nature of insurance savings that
could be realized by building owners who retrofit their buildings to be more resilient, and to publicize the
results to increase public awareness thereof;
6. CB2, Man. continues to advocate for City funding for resiliency related projects within CB2, as
outlined in our annual register of funding requests,
https://nyclpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=93a88691cace4067828b1eede432022b
https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/plans-studies/climate-resiliency/outreach-summary.pdf
447. Given the unique overlap of FEMA floodplains and historic landmarked districts that occurs
within Community District 2, CB2, Man. encourages further study to determine best practices for
improving the resiliency of buildings within these overlapping districts while still maintaining their
historic and aesthetic character,
8. Though CB2. Man. understands the need to establish a process through which variances can be
granted by the BSA in special situations, CB2 requests that the language in the Zoning Text Amendment
be modified to place a specific, measurable cap on such variances, and in general believes that to the
extent possible, any foreseen special situations should be addressed in the Zoning Resolution itself rather
than left to a future BSA variance,
9. CB,2, Man. requests that the City consider whether or not additional types of vulnerable
populations beyond nursing homes should be considered when limiting development within the
floodplain,
10. In the event of Recovery Provisions being activated in the context of a future disaster, with a
proposed Designated Recovery Area that overlaps with Community District 2’s boundaries, CB2, Man.
requests to be promptly consulted on the proposed geographic scope and timeframe of such provisions, as
is required when proposing a text amendment to implement such provisions.
Vote: Unanimous, with 46 Board Members in favor.

4. Jeremy Schaller or Entity to be Formed d/b/a TBD, 23 Cleveland Pl. 10012 (New OP)
i. Whereas, the Applicant appeared before Community Board 2, Manhattan’s SLA Licensing
Committee to present an application to the Liquor Authority for a new on-premise liquor license to
operate a bar specializing in sausage and other meat products within a ground floor storefront located in a
4-story mixed use building (Circa 1900) located on Cleveland Place between Spring and Kenmare Streets
directly across from Petrosino Square in Nolita; and,
ii. Whereas, the storefront premise was previously operated in the past as Le Jardin Bistro (2009–
2011) and The Cleveland Restaurant (2012–2015), the premises having a significant history generating
significant complaints as it relates to a 1,300 SF exterior backyard at the rear of the premises, which the
prior operators used for eating, drinking and live music but which was never permitted, and instead was
repeatedly disapproved by the NYC Dept. of Buildings, the existing certificate of occupancy presented for
the storefront premise permitting an occupancy limited to 50 for eating and drinking on the interior first
floor only but does not extend such use and occupancy to the rear yard or the basement; and,
49iii. Whereas, more recently and subsequent to the unpermitted use of the rear yard between 2009 and

TRAFFIC AND TRANSPORTATION
1. Resolution requesting a CitiBike station just south of Clarkson & Varick Sts. as an
alternative to the proposed King & Varick Sts. location
Whereas the NYC Dept. of Transportation (DOT) presented an overview of 10 new proposed locations
for CitiBike stations in Community Board 2 Manhattan (CB2, Man.) at the November meeting of CB2's
Traffic and Transportation Committee; and
Whereas one of the proposed locations, King St. & Varick St., in the northeast roadbed, has elicited
concerns in terms of safety for both pedestrians and bicyclists; and
Whereas the 7th Ave. S. protected bike lane currently terminates at Houston St. & Varick St. (extension
of 7th Ave. S.) with a large bulbout on the southeast corner of Houston & Varick that blocks bicyclists
from proceeding further down Varick directly along the curb; and
Whereas the large bulbout jutting out presents an obstacle that is not only unsafe for bicyclists in
compelling them to swerve around it into the street and into moving traffic, but also is hazardous for
pedestrians standing on the bulbout waiting to cross the street who would be vulnerable to being struck by
bicycles on their way to the King &Varick location whose riders may be unable to stop in time to avoid a
collision; and
Whereas there has been some discussion about investigating the possibility of continuing the 7th Ave. S.
bike lane further south on Varick, however conditions such as Holland Tunnel-bound traffic, local
delivery and loading needs, and narrow sidewalks merit an in-depth study of this southern stretch to
accommodate bicyclists' safely in balance with all users' needs, which would take a considerable amount
of time, and a CitiBike station in this area is needed now; and
Whereas the Hudson Square Connection BID, which covers this area and is vastly familiar with its
operations and needs (and also has several CitiBike stations in its precincts), has proposed locating a
CitiBike station just south of Clarkson & Varick Sts. (on Varick's east side) as an alternative to the
proposed King & Varick Sts. location; and
65Whereas the Clarkson & Varicks Sts. location is just a little more than a block north of the King St. one,
and would fulfill CitiBike network needs just as effectively; and
Whereas the Hudson Square BID is proposing that the Clarkson/Varick Citibike station they recommend
be placed in the floating parking lane that buffers the bike lane at that Varick St. location, safe and
convenient for bike lane users, while not interfering with emergency vehicle access. This approach has
already been used successfully at 9th Ave. and W. 45th St. in midtown Manhattan; and
Whereas the small businesses adjacent to the proposed Clarkson & Varick St. CitiBike station site favor
having the station there, and think it will be good for business; and
Therefore, be it resolved CB2, Man. fully supports locating a new CitiBike station just south of Clarkson
& Varick Sts. (on Varick's east side) as an alternative to the proposed King & Varick Sts. location; and
Be it further resolved that CB2, Man. is in favor of the Citibike station being placed in the floating
parking lane at the Clarkson/Varick location; and
Be it finally resolved that CB2, Man. urges DOT to install the CitiBike station at the Clarkson/Varick
location as soon as possible.
Vote: Unanimous, with 46 Board Members in favor.
2. Resolution recommending a study and plan for Canal St. to analyze and remedy its long-
lived dangerous and community-destroying conditions.
Whereas Canal St. has long been a severely dangerous thoroughfare threatening the safety and well-being
of pedestrians, bicyclists and motorists alike, and its hazardous conditions continue to grow: from 2016 to
2020, at least 2,567 reported crashes occurred on Canal Street between Hudson St. and the Manhattan
Bridge - almost 2 per day that injured at least 54 cyclists (killing one), 109 pedestrians (killing one) and
229 motor vehicle occupants (killing one); and
Whereas conditions on Canal St. not only endanger people's lives, but also interfere with the safe and
effective conduct of business: the congested streets hinder deliveries to businesses, often leading to
double-parking that blocks sidewalks and intersections, while crowded sidewalks limit space allocated to
street vendors, resulting in sidewalk conflicts; and
Whereas with curb-to-curb street widths up to almost 100 ft. wide (dimensions more akin to a super
highway than a city street), Canal St. creates a vast chasm between its north and south sidewalks,
thwarting people's safe crossing from one side of the street to the other and impeding community
connections and cohesiveness; and
Whereas as many as seven lanes operate on segments of Canal St. (e.g., the east end of the street (near
Bowery/Mott/Elizabeth) has left turn/center medians + three travel lanes in each direction, and btw.
Broadway and W. Broadway there are three lanes in each direction + a parking lane that is No Standing
during rush hour, in both cases adding up to seven lanes). Many of these lanes are as wide as 12 or 13 ft.,
some even up to 15 ft., unnecessarily excessive widths not needed to accommodate even the widest
trucks; and
""Another Pedestrian is Killed in Chinatown,"" Streetsblog NYC, Jan. 26, 2020.
Manhattan Topographical Bureau, Office of the Manhattan Borough President, Manhattan Section Maps 16 and 17.
66Whereas pedestrian density on Canal St.'s sidewalks is so intense that pedestrians are often forced to
walk in the street where they risk being hit by oncoming traffic. Although pedestrian volumes are three
times those of motor vehicles, 90% of street space goes to the vehicles; and
Whereas the heavy, snarled flow of vehicular traffic on Canal wreaks havoc on the orderly progression of
vehicles, botching up movement at intersections and crosswalks by blocking vehicular passage and
turning movements, while also obstructing and endangering pedestrians crossing the street. Gridlock
often prevents drivers traveling east on Canal from moving across the street's many lanes to reach turning
points heading north, such as at West Broadway, Greene, Centre, Mulberry and Elizabeth Sts., with
drivers often ending up in Brooklyn; and
Whereas bicycling in NYC increased by 116% between 2008-2018, and 34% between 2013-2018. While
bicycling figures on Canal St. itself are not available, counts on the Manhattan Bridge which leads into
and extends from Canal St. show an average increase in daily bicycle volumes from 6,008 in 2019 to
7,093 by Oct. 2020, all indicating the increased need for safe and accessible bicycle facilities on Canal
St.; and
Whereas after almost 35 years, 2-way tolling on the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge was reinstated on
12/01/2020, removing the impetus for vehicles to skirt an expensive one-way double toll that led New
Jersey-bound motorists and truckers to take a long, alternate route over the toll-free Manhattan Bridge and
through Canal Street to the westbound toll-free Holland Tunnel, exacerbating traffic congestion on Canal.
These new conditions call for a fresh look at Canal St.; and
Whereas congestion pricing now expected, with its potential for eliminating toll-free travel on the
Manhattan Bridge, merits a new look at Canal St. as well; and
Whereas Canal St. is in the midst of change, with new occupants moving in and on the cusp of additional
change, making it a particularly suitable time ripe for a study to determine how Canal can be improved
and to plan appropriately for its future;
Therefore, be it resolved that CB2, Man. urges the NYC Dept. of Transportation (DOT) to immediately
conduct a study and create a plan to address the many traffic problems on Canal St. and formulate
solutions to them that ensure safe passage and access for pedestrians, accommodation for vehicles of
different types that reduce their negative impacts, and street improvements to facilitate the conduct of
business and build community life; and
Be it further resolved that CB2, Man. also urges DOT to include as part of a Canal St. improvement plan
easy to implement improvements that can be quickly completed to provide swift betterment, using
applications such as paint, markings, bollards, delineators and planters, as well as more permanent, built
improvements to be accomplished in the long term; and
Be it further resolved that CB2, Man. greatly encourages DOT to seriously consider removing a lane of
traffic and/or reducing too-wide traffic lanes to 10 ft. or 10.5 ft. widths (which can easily accommodate a
large truck) in order to provide more sidewalk space; and

67Be it further resolved that CB2, Man. strongly recommends that DOT design and implement a suitable
protected bike lane to serve the needs of the growing number of bicyclists who use Canal St. for
crosstown travel, if not on Canal than on a nearby westbound cross street to compliment the eastbound
Grand St. lane; and
Be it further resolved that CB2 advises DOT to carefully examine the potential for employing additional
means of improvement already proven to be effective in promoting pedestrian safety and creating an
equitable and workable balance of street space between pedestrians and vehicular modes, such as
neckdowns to shorten crossing distances, pedestrian priority traffic signals like Leading Pedestrian
Intervals (LPIs) or split phasing, simplified intersections (some with vehicular left turn bans where
appropriate), curbside reform, including increased commercial loading zones and designated space for
street vendors, and pedestrian safety islands; and
Be it further resolved that CB2 asks that a timeline be created that firmly establishes the start and
completion dates of the study and times for reporting back to the community and receiving input; and
Be it finally resolved that CB2 implores DOT to work quickly to develop a Canal St. study plan and
begin timely implementation.

STANDING COMMITTEE REPORTS
LANDMARKS AND PUBLIC AESTHETICS
1. 340 Bleecker Street. Application is to install a bracket sign replacing a historic neon sign for
ground floor storefront.
A. A neon sign, shown in a 1969 tax photograph in a style of the 20s or 30s for Aldo’s Restaurant was
removed several tenants ago, presumably in the 1970s; and
B. The bracket, as depicted in the photo, remains; and
C. The applicant seeks to install a similar neon sign with orange lettering for a new restaurant of a similar
size and design, though the rendering lacked many details that were described by the applicant and are
depicted in the original sign; and
D. The size exceeds the current size permissible under current regulations in this location and is suitable
to the building and to the infill design; and
E. In response to Committee concerns that the graphic appearance of the design as rendered was too
contemporary and out of sync with the original sign it seeks to replicate, the applicant represented that a
revised design for the sign would reproduce as exactly as possible including size, shape, color, font and
style of the name, painted highlighting of the letters, and exposure of the connecting sections of
yellow/orange neon tubing and would, in effect, appear as the original sign with the word “Aldo’s”
changed to “Amos”; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends approval of the revised design agreed by the
applicant matching as closely as possible the original sign as depicted in a historic photograph with details
as described in whereas E above.
Vote: Unanimous, with 45 Board members in favor.
32. 160 Prince Street Application is to remove existing storefront windows and install a new
storefront infill.
Whereas:
A. The restaurant at the corner of Prince and Thompson Streets has uniform small, high windows with
white brick infill in the corner bays; and along the two facades; and
B. The application is to replace the corner bays’ windows with full length operable doors in brown/grey
steel, a minimal bulkhead and with plate glass; and
C. A historic photograph depicts tall windows with an approximately 3’ bulkhead which is harmonious
with the Vesuvio Bakery, adjacent to the restaurant in the same building; and
D. Modification of the design to more nearly conform to the image in the historic photograph, especially
with regard to the height and material of the bulkhead, would reflect the historic design: and
C. In a letter from Community Board 2 Manhattan to the State Liquor Authority dated February 28, 2017
making recommendations concerning a liquor license, subsequently approved, the following stipulation
was agreed: “There will not be any French doors or windows installed to the front façade and all existing
doors and windows will be closed at all times except for patron egress; and
D. This recommendation is made by the Board in consideration of the stipulation agreed by the applicant
as well as the landmarks and aesthetic aspects of the application and there was representation by the chair
of the SLA Committee at the time of the resolution that without this stipulation approval of the license
would not have been recommended; and
E. There was community opposition to the SLA Committee at the time of licensing and to the Landmarks
Committee to full length operable windows; and
F. The Board received written and oral opposition to this application; now
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. recommends denial of the application unless the design is
revised to conform closely to the historic design depicted in the historic photograph especially with
respect to: the height of the bulkhead and the size and design of the windows which will not be operable
and, that the bulkhead be material left in place from the existing façade.
Vote: Unanimous, with 45 Board members in favor.
PARKS/ WATERFRONT
1. A Resolution Regarding the Proposed Design of the Interim Renovation of Mercer
Playground
Whereas:
1. Ricardo Hinkle, Senior Landscape Architect for the NYC Department of Parks & Recreation
(DPR), on behalf of DPR and NYU, presented an updated version of a proposed design for the
interim renovation of Mercer Playground, the 300 ft x 45 ft space located on Mercer Street
between Bleecker and West 3rd Streets that today has passive seating, a spray shower area and an
4active multi-use area that has been an open play space where pre-teens learn to ride bikes, scooters
and skateboards; and
2. The updated proposed design was based on feedback and a resolution written after the initial
version of the design was presented at our meeting on February 2020 in response to discussion
during a March 2019 scoping session that was run by DPR; and
3. The updated proposed design effectively addressed the concerns conveyed and requests made in
our February 2020 resolution including the creation of a master plan vision for the space, despite
budgetary constraints that limit the amount of actual construction possible in this phase : more
challenging track activities, better benches, and a reduction of wall and pavement painting
concepts; and
4. The current budget for the Mercer Playground renovation is $385,000: $350,000 for construction
costs and $35,000 for design, most of which has already been spent, which was pledged by NYU
as part of the Core Plan agreed upon as part of NYU’s development projects in the area; and
5. NYU remains committed to deliver this level of funding, but additional funding from NYU or any
other source is deemed unlikely in the near future given the city’s current fiscal environment; and
6. The large majority of those in attendance were appreciative of Mr. Hinkle’s efforts and expressed
positive comments stating that the updated design was much improved and addressed previously
conveyed concerns; and
7. Some local residents in attendance expressed concerns that use of the playground, once renovated,
might be taken over on a daily basis by older skateboarders and that their activities would create a
great deal of noise and risk of injury to younger children; and
8. There remain questions about how DPR will operate the playground to ensure that it will be
primarily enjoyed by its target group of children and pre-teens, recognizing that signage alone is
an ineffective deterrent.
Therefore, be it Resolved that CB2, Man.:
1. Appreciates the funding provided by NYU and the efforts of the NYC Department of Parks and
Recreation to renovate the central play area of Mercer Playground; and
2. Agrees that the updated and presented design reflects the recommendations and concerns
expressed by our committee after presentation of the original design; and
3. Supports renovation of the park according to the new design though we appreciate that there are
questions and opposition from some in the community about how the renovated playground will
be used, operated and monitored; and
4. Requests that DPR limit hours and define operating rules for the playground that are responsive to
community concerns and that optimize use by the target age group of children (pre-teens and
younger).
Vote: Unanimous, with 45 Board Members in favor.
52. Resolution in support of a proposal by NYU in partnership with the NYC Department of
Parks & Recreation and NYC Department of Transportation, to improve a small sidewalk area
along Bleecker Street adjacent to the north entry of the public atrium at 181 Mercer Street by
continuing the Bleecker Street Landscape aesthetic to the east.
Whereas:
1. A new building is being constructed at 181 Mercer St between West Houston and Bleecker Street,
where Coles Gym previously stood, which will have a public atrium on the ground floor; and
2. Representatives from NYU, DPR and DOT presented a proposal to redesign what will be the
adjoining sidewalk area abutting the north side of the building, along the south side Bleecker St.,
from Mercer St, 35 ft deep, running for roughly 200 ft to the west; and
3. Implementing this design would make it consistent with and integrate it into the greater Bleecker
St. landscape which will ring the periphery of the super blocks and feature strategically placed
open, refurbished planting beds, a double sidewalks (with an interior sidewalk), lower fences, and
continuation of the tree canopy, with some restrictions of where trees can be planted due to
underground access requirements. ADA compliant seating can go in such locations.
Therefore, be it Resolved that CB2, Man.:
Supports this proposal to improve this sidewalk area on Bleecker St next to what will be 181 Mercer
Street.
Vote: Unanimous, with 45 Board Members in favor.
QUALITY OF LIFE
1. 17 East 9th Street - Application to construct, maintain and use a front stoop to a parlor way
main entry into the house and steps to a lower secondary entry to the basement level:
Whereas, this applicant wishes to restore the stoop, steps, and entryway to an historic version (below);
and
6Whereas, the applicant appeared before CB2’s Landmarks and Public Aesthetics Committee in April
2020 at which time the committee and later all of CB2, Man. recommended denial for this application;
and
Whereas, the CB2, Man. Landmarks resolution stated that the proposed stair extension into the public
sidewalk runs 7 ‘-11” as opposed to the usual depth of 6’-6” on this block and in the district generally and
that this “stoop design appears bulky and intrudes unacceptably into the narrow sidewalk”; and
Whereas, the CB2, Man. Landmarks resolution recommended that there are “solutions to reduce the run
of the stairs such as adding a step or two at the parlor entry and do minor additional excavation in the
areaway to ensure headroom for the basement entry below the stoop”; and
Whereas, the applicant did not amend their application to adhere to the recommendation made by the
CB2, Man. Landmarks Committee regarding the sidewalk extension and the proposed stairway still runs
7’-11’ inches into the sidewalk; and
Whereas, this committee found the proposed design to be an improvement over the current state of this
location, but wished the applicant had taken extra measures to conform to the 6’6” depth of the stoop
extension as recommended, in order to conform with similar historic stoops on this street and in this
district; now
Therefore Be It Resolved that CB2, Man. recommends denial of the application to construct, maintain
and use a front stoop to a parlor way main entry into the house and steps to a lower secondary
entry to the basement level unless the applicant reduces the proposed stoop extension to a maximum of
6’-6”.
Vote: Passed, with 44 Board Members in favor, and 1 in opposition (R. Sanz).
7th
2. 33 Ninth Avenue at West 13 Street - Application is for a modification of a revocable
consent to construct/continue to use an ADA wheelchair lift and exterior stairway:
th
Whereas, this applicant wishes to relocate the platforms, stairs, and ADA lift, located on the West 13
Street side of this address, so as to maintain a code compliant means of egress while turning the stairways
outward to face the street; and
Whereas, the current platform at this location—previously occupied by Spice Market, is unsightly and is
often found cluttered with large, conspicuous containers; and
Whereas, the applicant stated that the new building owner would prefer to remove the unsightly platform
(below) entirely; and
Whereas, however the applicant stated that the removal of the platform would require extensive
relocation of sewer and electrical lines and is cost prohibitive; and
Whereas, the committee agrees that it would be much preferable to remove this platform entirely and
place the stairs and ADA lift within the building; and
Whereas, the design presented (below) is definitely an improvement on the current configuration because
the stairs will be front facing and more inviting to passerby and the dimensions of the platform and
sidewalk intrusion remain the same; and
Whereas, the applicant stated that this design has received staff level approval at the Landmarks
Preservation Commission and has received staff approval from the Department of Transportation; and
Whereas, this committee found the proposed design to be an improvement over the current state of this
location, but hopes the applicant researches every possible reasonable alternative that would remove the
platform entirely; now
8Therefore Be It Resolved that CB2, Man. recommends approval of the application is for a modification
of a revocable consent to construct/continue to use an ADA wheelchair lift and exterior stairway provided
that, the application conforms with all applicable zoning laws, rules, and regulations and clearance
requirements.
Vote: Unanimous, with 45 Board Members in favor.

Letter Regarding Temporary Outdoor Dining
June 6, 2020
Hon. Bill de Blasio Hon. Corey Johnson
Mayor, City of New York New York City Council Speaker
Hon. Andrew Cohen
Chair, Committee on Consumer Affairs and
Business Licensing
RE: Int 1957-2020 Temporary Space for Outdoor Dining
Dear Mayor de Blasio, Speaker Johnson, and Councilmember Cohen:
Thank you for your leadership in guiding the residents and businesses of CB2, Man. through the COVID-
19 pandemic.
Implementing a safe and responsible temporary outdoor dining program will provide a level of certainty
for our eating and drinking establishments as they prepare for Phase II of the Reopening. Our
neighborhoods – Little Italy, SoHo, NoHo, Chinatown, West Village, Greenwich Village, Hudson Square,
Nolita, Gansevoort Market, and University Place – need this program to bridge the gap as we move
forward in the process of stabilizing our community.
CB2 has a significant concentration of eating and drinking establishments, one of the highest densities of
liquor licenses in the city, and the highest number of sidewalk cafés across all five boroughs. We believe
that temporary outdoor dining is a critical injection of much-needed economic activity for the eating and
drinking establishments that define our neighborhood and, in some cases, define the fabric of the city.
While we are very much in support of this program, we understand that there may also be significant
impacts in respect to quality of life issues for our community.
10CB2’s streetscape is unique in many ways with pockets of non-grid streets juxtaposed to large avenues,
and we are positioned to offer our eating and drinking establishments creative opportunities and our
residents a positive experience, contributing to both the economic viability and the vitality of our
neighborhood. There are many dining opportunities that go beyond those presented in the proposed
legislation and those presented by the Mayor. Let us be clear, we need temporary spaces for outdoor
dining to ensure that they can begin the process of recovery and we can provide a healthy, outdoor dining
experience for CB2 residents who have been quarantined over the past two and a half months…our
psychological health depends on it.
We have identified four types of outdoor dining opportunities in CB2, spaces for exclusive use by eating
and drinking establishments by permit:
1. Spaces immediately adjacent in proximity: sidewalks, parking spaces, or immediate curb
lanes/parking spaces
a. Temporary sidewalk cafés where permitted.
b. Sidewalk café-like spaces extended into street immediately adjacent, i.e. parking spaces.
c. Equitable to nearby commercial entities (e.g. can’t utilize spaces in front of adjacent
businesses which may use spaces for other purposes and provide visibility).
d. Provides opportunity for minimal additional seating on a daily basis.
2. Spaces in close proximity: larger roadbed within a block or two or around the corner, but
may not be immediately adjacent
a. Extension of restaurant – an outdoor proper dining section on certain days.
b. Serve from the restaurant with an outdoor wait station and service component.
c. Several different restaurant sections for different establishments could be located on a
shared/closed street.
d. In a residentially-zoned area, the applicant must receive a letter of support from
Community Board 2 before the permit is granted.
e. Within this type of use, we propose two types of street closures with a specificity of
contiguous closure based on its size:
i. Smaller street closures: more significant seating with potential for multiple day
closures and, in certain circumstances, partial closures on all days.
ii. Larger street closures: more significant seating on specific days only (i.e. Friday
evening, Saturday, and Sunday).
3. Spaces more than a block or two away
a. Spaces more than a block or two away should be managed by a BID or other similar
organization.
b. In a residentially-zoned area, the applicant must receive a letter of support from
Community Board 2 before the permit is granted.
c. If an eating and drinking establishment outside the boundaries of Community Board 2
applies for a permit, the applicant must receive a letter of support from Community Board
2 before the permit is granted.
d. Establish a fuller outdoor service area.
e. Operated more independently from restaurant, i.e. more self-sufficient.
f. Delineated and operated exclusively for the benefit of one business even though there
could be several businesses adjacent (i.e. separated for both SLA regulations and DOH
regulations – serving the alcohol and cleaning the tables, respectively).
g. Provide opportunity for more significant seating when not practicable in immediate
proximity on certain days.
114. Spaces for shared outdoor seating among multiple eating and drinking establishments
a. More of a take-out model.
b. Shared seating between businesses. Organized by group of established businesses.
c. Possible with street.
Without question, we do not condone the use of parks, plazas, POPS (publicly owned private spaces),
rooftops or rear yards in CB2 for the temporary outdoor dining program. We would prefer to maintain
what naturally already occurs in parks, plazas and POPS, which is people self-selecting to purchase take-
out food for consumption in those areas on a one-by-one basis instead of a fully programmed outdoor
dining experience in our parks-starved district. Our two major plazas in proximity to restaurants in CB2
are managed by local BIDs. Rooftop dining or rear yard gardens are highly controversial issues in most
cases and subject to zoning, building, and safety regulations which are too complex to be included as part
of this temporary fast-moving program.
In keeping with the creative spirit of our residents and eating and drinking establishment owners, we are
working diligently to begin the process of identifying areas of consideration that fit within the four types
of outdoor dining opportunities listed above. Please see the attached addendum addressing areas of
consideration, which are a sampling of streets submitted by CB2 eating and drinking establishments that
should be starting points of a discussion with residents and city agencies.
Equity for existing CB2 eating and drinking establishments is our priority for this program and we believe
it is these establishments that should have first right-of-refusal for spaces that are potentially to be
allocated to food trucks and street vendors co-locating in CB2, particularly in the areas of consideration
outlined in the attached addendum. We also request that there be an opportunity for CB2 in partnership
with local businesses to be able to present outdoor dining opportunities to the appropriate agencies, which
may not at first pass meet the requirements outlined by the city, but which may provide appropriate
opportunities for outdoor dining.
In order to ensure that the legislation meets the needs of our residents and the eating and drinking
establishments, we have identified the core criteria, in the attached addendum, that temporary outdoor
dining permit applicants should adhere to and be held accountable for throughout the permitting,
implementation, and operational. There should be one agency overseeing the permitting and enforcement
program with a designated program head. Critical to balancing opportunities for vibrant dining options
and community support in our highly residential community, hours of operation should end at 10PM for
all temporary dining options and no outdoor music should be permitted.
We cannot stress enough how critical a clear enforcement plan is to the success of this temporary
program. Because of this, we propose that permits for temporary outdoor dining be issued on a
30-day basis with automatic renewal for businesses without significant complaints. For businesses that
receive significant and verified complaints, there should be a process established for fast review of
complaints with law enforcement and CB2 input. This process would reward compliance and weed out
bad actors that pose a public safety, public health or quality of life risk in a very transparent and timely
manner. Our residents deserve a plan that addresses how the mitigation of bad actors will be handled. This
is non-negotiable for the integrity of our community.
Our neighborhoods are a reflection of the mutual cooperation between residents and eating and drinking
establishment owners. To ensure the final piece of legislation is structured to meet that cooperation, we
have outlined a list of concerns that will extend beyond the purview of the temporary outdoor dining
program because we rely on you to use our civic foresight to ensure that the mechanics of this program do
not negatively impact the quality of life for our residents.
12We understand there are significant hurdles in implementation, but with careful and expeditious input
from the CB2, there could be significant mitigation of those quality of life impacts, yielding a better
implementation of this program that is necessary for the future vibrancy of our community.
One concern is the loophole in the legislation regarding the duration of the temporary outdoor dining
program. While we understand that the duration of the program is “until October 31, 2020 or when social
distancing requirements are lifted,” the use of language in the latter portion leaves a wide interpretation
and leaves the residents of CB2 in potential peril of a never-ending nuisance. Predictions from models
developed by the Imperial College of London indicate that social distancing requirements will continue to
be a part of our daily lives for the foreseeable future, potentially in place contiguously until a vaccine is
developed. A second wave is imminent, so much so that the “or when social distancing requirements are
lifted” leaves our residents vulnerable to a program that stays in place indefinitely due to the very nature
of the expected and anticipated second wave of COVID-19.
Furthermore, the “or when” also creates a critical level of uncertainty for our eating and drinking
establishments who will potentially be forced to change their business model midway through the
program if social distancing guidelines are lifted ahead of the October 31, 2020 deadline, robbing them of
taking advantage of the full revenue potential in a temporary outdoor dining space. We ask that you create
a definitive end date to the program of Sunday, November 1, 2020, as Halloween falls on a Saturday this
year. This would enable our eating and drinking establishments to take full advantage of the increased
street activity of the Halloween Parade, historically an important revenue generator for our local
businesses, should that be allowed to continue. With a definitive end date, the eating and drinking
establishment owners in CB2 can more effectively calculate the viability of the investment they will have
to make to participate in the temporary outdoor dining program.
There should be ample opportunity to review the merits of this temporary program over the winter months
so that our residents can maintain their voice in how our streetscape is shaped going forward. Should the
program continue longer, we propose a potential to renew, but only after a public review and input by
Community Board 2 to ensure we mitigate any outstanding, overarching issues not addressed by the
mandatory 30-day review installed as part of the program. We recognize the financial burden taken on by
eating and drinking establishment owners to participate in this program, and do not support any measures
that would shorten the length of the temporary outdoor dining program outside of a permit holder in non-
compliance with the criteria outlined in the attached addendum.
Creativity is ingrained in the spirit of CB2’s neighborhoods and could not be more germane to the grit of
CB2 residents as we live through the realities of COVID-19, persevering in solidarity with the city’s
current state of unrest and the tenacity of CB2’s eating and drinking establishments owners hanging on, in
the hopes to serve another day. This letter outlines an extraordinary proposal that we as a community
support in this extraordinary time. We actively seek your support in helping us shape the temporary
outdoor dining program into a model that will not only prudently meet the needs of CB2, but will elevate
and shift the conversations in other neighborhoods as it relates to outdoor dining, potentially keeping the
doors open for another beloved eating and drinking institution that makes this city live up to its name as
the Hospitality Capital of the World.
Thank you for your consideration.

Addendum: Concerns
Addendum: Areas of Consideration
Addendum: Reopening Working Group Committee Report, June 1, 2020
13ADDENDUM #1
RECOMMENDED CRITERIA FOR
TEMPORARY SPACES FOR OUTDOOR DINING
Hours
• For all temporary spaces: 10AM to 10PM, all days. All patrons out at closing time. Set Up/Clean
Up for ½ hour before and after.
Noise
• No music/speakers outdoors at any time and no music generated from the interior premises
audible on the outside.
Smoking
• No Smoking in or within 10ft.
Diagrams
• Require submission of diagrams with measurements, clearances and requirement to operate as
presented.
Permitting/Process
• CB2 should be involved for a quick, efficient review of all permitholders across the three phases
of the temporary outdoor dining program: permitting, implementation, and operational review.
• Any permitting process should involve CB2, who is familiar with its businesses, its streets, its
residents, and the dynamics/concerns of the communities. We are prepared and ready to do this
expeditiously.
• There should be a single agency, with a specific person overseeing this program, reviewing
permits for an efficient, effective permitting process and that agency should be committed to
working with the Community Board for the issuance of permits.
Amount of Seating
• Only seated patrons should be served in the temporary outdoor dining areas.
• Businesses that are exclusively “to-go” establishments during normal operations should not be
able to participate.
• Establishments that have less than 20 interior seats during normal operations should be limited to
temporary sidewalk cafes or parking spaces in front of the establishment.
• For temporary outdoor dining on closed/shared streets, establishments should be limited to 50% of
their normally operating interior seating capacity with a maximum of 32 temporary outdoor seats
for any establishment irrespective of interior size.
• If multiple businesses are to operate next to each other on a closed street, the plan should be
specifically reviewed by CB2 in order to provide input and recommend mitigation including
potential limiting of seats in order to not overwhelm quality of life concerns on residential streets
and also accommodate opportunities for multiple businesses.
• There should be no “standing room only” areas.
14Enforcement
• Mandatory 30-day review period (with an option to expeditious cure) for all permitholders with
significant complaints during the duration of the temporary outdoor dining program with
revocation of permits for bad actors. Consider issuing permits for 30-day periods which
automatically renew for those without significant complaints.
• Due to the current economic climate, the deterrent for non-compliance should be loss of continued
participation in the temporary outdoor dining program as opposed to using fines.
• Identify the singular agency that will be solely responsible for reviewing permits, taking into
account the multiple enforcement agencies during the operational phase of the temporary outdoor
dining program, with a transparent and expeditious process to resolve the complaint.
Non-Traditional
• Allow catering establishments with on-premise seating, ground-floor event facilities, permanent
liquor license and on-premise restrooms to participate in all temporary outdoor dining programs if
they have the ability to serve customers directly.
Opportunities for Exceptions with Community Board Review
• There should be an opportunity for CB2, in partnership with local businesses, to be able to present
outdoor dining opportunities to the appropriate agencies, which may not at first pass meet the
requirements eventually outlined by the city, but which may provide appropriate opportunities for
outdoor dining.
• For example, West 8th Street full closure/shared street which has a bus route and which also has
successfully provided opportunities for outdoor dining to many restaurants on multiple weekends.
Street Closures/Shared Streets
• Larger Street Closures: Friday: 5PM-10PM; Saturday & Sunday: 10AM-10PM.
• Smaller Street Closures: Monday - Friday: 5PM-10PM; Saturday & Sunday: 10AM-10PM.
• Exceptions may exist for specific locations which will be considered. This should include a short
review opportunity for Community Board 2 to ensure resident and eating and drinking
establishment cooperation.
• Staggered hours will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis including a small window for deliveries.
Adjacent Space
• Cannot block another business or residence.
Spaces Not to Be Considered (please refer to the four types of outdoor dining spaces outlined in the
letter dated June 2, 2020 for guidance)
• No temporary rooftop dining or temporary rear yards.
• No parks.
• No POPS (publicly owned private spaces).
• No plazas (managed by BIDs in CB2).
Clearances
• Emergency Vehicle Lane for all closed/shared streets
• Residential Entries: clearly delineated residential entry access with social distancing clearance
requirements
• 8-foot right of way on sidewalks with 6-foot separation between tables/chairs for temporary dining
for customers.
15• Bike Lanes: additional restrictions needed for streets with bike lanes that are designated spaces for
temporary outdoor dining in larger roadbeds
• Protected Bike Lanes should be maintained with safety features for diners and bicyclists. If bicycle
lanes are heavily used, this may provide significant safety issues to serving patrons in parking
spaces across bicycle lanes and should be reviewed on a case by case basis.
Garbage and Waste Disposal, Sanitation Issues
• Operator to provide a plan to mitigate increased trash generated by a temporary outdoor dining
experience, also taking into consideration the possibility of an increased use of recyclable and
compostable utensils, serving plates and drinking cups.
• Thorough cleaning of outdoor areas and sidewalk or roadbed immediately after dining service.
Storage of Tables and Chairs
• Throughout the duration of the permit holder’s term, all tables and chairs utilized for the purpose
of temporary outdoor dining shall be stored inside the brick-and-mortar premises as the preferred
method. If this cannot be accomplished, tables and chairs must be stored flush to the outside
building façade using a secure method that will prevent vandalism and deter theft or unruly use
during periods of civil unrest.
Restrooms
• DOH must provide guidance on how to ensure the operator either develops a sanitization plan for
increased indoor restroom use, particularly during Phase 2 and Phase 3, and/or the procurement of
temporary outdoor restroom facilities
• Any use of temporary restrooms, if required, should be granted by a special permit on top of the
temporary outdoor dining permit to mitigate any resident issues including location, allocation
(number of port-o-johns allowed per seats allocated), and maintenance plan (how often emptied,
etc.) and should be properly secured as to prevent vandalism and improper use.
ADDENDUM #2
CONCERNS REGARDING
TEMPORARY SPACES FOR OUTDOOR DINING
STATE OF THE CITY
• Unrest vs. Stability and Impacts on Outdoor Dining.
STORAGE OF TABLES AND CHAIRS
• Proper storage along building lines during non-operating hours to prevent seating outside of hours
of operation.
• Prevent weaponization of items for unruly purposes.
NOISE
• Impact on residents above and next to temporary outdoor dining spaces.
• No Music.
SAFETY
• Appropriate safe, social-distance clearance for residential entryways.
• Social Distance Compliance
• Table Spacing and Seating
16• PPE (customers and workers)
• Barriers
• Signage
• Lighting
• Customer Public Safety in Temporary Spaces
• Restaurant Worker Safety
• Peaceful Protests
ALCOHOL
• Loitering and To-Go Drinks
• Lack of enforcement for open container laws/public consumption
• Lack of Social Distancing and Mask Compliance
• Heat Exhaustion
• Inebriation
• Public Urination
RESTROOMS
• Socially distant use and access to indoor restrooms during Phase 2 and Phase 3.
• Temporary restrooms potentially needed to mitigate the increased outdoor density – additional
cost for permit holders.
SMOKING
• No Smoking in temporary locations or immediately adjacent.
PROCESS
• Ensure a quick and efficient permitting process while preserving Community Board input
EQUITY
• Equitable division of the space available for use.
• Equitable allocation of tables and chairs per business proportionate to indoor seating.
• Equity access for an open space, including street-level, second floor, and basement.
• Equity for access to tables and chairs for using during temporary period.
• Equity for other sidewalk uses: pedestrians, curbside pick-up for retailers, etc.
• Equity between eating and drinking establishments, street vendors, and food trucks.
• Equity for bars, especially our storied lesbian and gay bars and other historic watering holes, for
which these temporary outdoor dining models do not adequately benefit.
COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF PERMIT REGULATIONS
• DOH Inspectors
• SLA Inspectors
• DCA Inspectors
• NYPD
• FDNY
• 311
TRAFFIC
• Provide signage more than 1 block away of full street closures ahead to alleviate traffic congestion
by incentivizing turning in advance of street closure.
17WEATHER
• Hot temperatures and rain.
• Temporary shade and rain covers.
CLIMATE ISSUES
• Doors open with A/C running.
QUEUES AND QUEUE MANAGEMENT
• Five types of queues that will be in play during Phase III, creating competition for space:
1. Waiting for seating in temporary outdoor dining space.
2. Waiting to place take-out order.
3. Waiting to pick up take-out order.
4. Food delivery workers waiting for delivery orders.
5. Handling concurrent lines for other businesses.
REDUCED CUSTOMER BASE
• Note that there is very light office population, little tourism, and no NYU student population until
late August.
LANDMARKS AND HISTORIC DISTRICTS
• Ensure that the building fabric in historic districts is not compromised or removed for temporary
outdoor dining.

24SCHOOLS AND EDUCATION
Resolution in Support of Action Steps to Reduce Systematic Racism in our Public Schools
Whereas:
1. CB2, Man. acknowledges the generational and institutional racism that our Black and brown
brothers, sisters and non-binaries have suffered on our streets, in our schools and in our
workplaces for far too long;
2. For this reason, CB2 has formed the CB2 Equity Working Group, as a commitment to making
racial equity a primary focus;
3. New York State has the most racially segregated public schools in the nation based on a report by
i
the UCLA Civil Rights Project and heavily impacting these state rankings is New York City,
home to the largest and one of the most segregated public school systems in the nation;
4. In February 2020, Edward Fergus, Ph.D. presented a District 2 Disproportionality Study, an
analysis of District 2 data, which concluded that Black, Latinx and male students
ii
disproportionately receive more IEPs and suspensions and are under-enrolled in gifted program ;
5. Within District 2, schools like Lower Manhattan Community School, which enrolls many CB2
students in its middle school, have long-standing Restorative Justice and diversity programs in
place, but there is no formal mechanism within District 2, Manhattan or the DOE for sharing
resources or best practices;
6. Children as young as three show awareness of race and begin to categorize people by race and
children of color who are on the receiving end of racial prejudice develop racial awareness even
earlier due to their experiences;
7. Because young children see skin color and form judgements based on race and live in a world with
racially biased associations, such as books and movies where princesses are mostly white or attend
schools where teachers and students are mostly from a single racial group, educators must
explicitly understand and address racism, implicit bias, colorblindness and microaggression and
proactively develop a school environment and curricula that is anti-racist;
8. CB2’s elementary schools primarily enroll students from a single racial group: PS 3 is 63% White;
iii
PS 41 is 69% White; and PS 130 is 87% Asian ;
iv
9. White Privilege was popularized by Peggy McIntosh in her 1988 paper “White Privilege and
Male Privilege” in which she likened white privilege to “an invisible weightless knapsack of
special provisions, assurances, tools, maps, guides, codebooks, passports, visas, clothes, compass,
emergency gear, and blank checks” and also outlined 46 different examples of white privilege;
10. In majority white communities like CB2, Man. and majority white schools attended by many CB2
area students, it is critical that white parents and community members understand their implicit
biases and white privilege and serve as anti-racist advocates, by taking concrete action to undo
systemic racism;
11. In an economically treacherous moment unseen since The Great Depression, we cannot allow for
the police budget to remain sacrosanct while the city’s and state’s finances produce cuts to public
education; and,
2512. The backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic and remote learning has illuminated and exacerbated
the vast inequities in our educational system and the need for investment in public education.
Therefore, be it Resolved that Community Board 2, Man.:
1. Urges District 2 leadership to share broadly the results of the District 2 Disproportionality Study
with school and parent leaders within District 2 and Manhattan and that these results materially
inform the public discussions and policy recommendations of Community Education Council
District 2 and the educational decisions of District 2 leadership;
2. Insists that the Department of Education – centrally, in the borough of Manhattan, District 2 and
every public elementary, middle and high school in Manhattan Community Board 2 – commit to
disrupting systemic racism and inequitable practices in our schools, including supporting:
a. School-wide anti-racist initiatives that involve principals and teaching staff, school and
students and school and the parent community;
b. Mandatory school-wide diversity initiatives that advise on social justice policies, formation
of affinity groups and the implementation of culturally relevant sustaining curriculum;
c. Decolonizing all curriculum;
d. Ongoing, not one-time, training for school leaders;
e. Hiring of a more diverse teaching staff;
f. Borough and District-wide Diversity Councils to share resources and best practices and
push for change; and,
g. Promotions to leadership positions within schools, Districts, Boroughs and the DOE based
on a clear and defined track record of anti-racist educational initiatives;
3. Urges reporting initiatives to disrupt systemic racism, including the DOE to create a centralized
reporting mechanism for measuring, tracking and publicly
a. Publicly reporting data on suspensions and IEP classification by race and gender; and,
b. Addressing goals and progress of diversity initiatives in each school’s Quality Review
and Comprehensive Education Plan, including, but not limited to restorative justice
programs, formation of affinity groups, implementation of culturally relevant sustaining
curriculum and hiring of a diverse teaching staff;
264. Insists that the DOE implement bold strategies to reduce the digital divide including:
a. Ensuring that every student has a remote learning device -- and laptops with keyboards for
middle and high school students;
b. Providing access to high speed broadband, prioritizing low income communities and
students living in transitional housing; and,
c. Funding from DOE central, not individual school budgets, which only would result in
greater instructional cuts at schools that serve the most vulnerable students;
5. Implores our elected officials to outline a path towards budget justice that does not leave the
police budget untouched at a time when all other essential services – including education – may be
cut, so that we urge you to:
a. Reduce the NYPD budget by at least $1 billion this year and reallocate a significant
portion of this funding toward education; and,
b. Aggressively seek additional funding for our public schools and limit in-school budget
cuts.
VOTE: Unanimous, with 45 Board Members in favor.

northeast side of Gansevoort Plaza, an area with a lot of foot traffic; and

that the lack of New York restaurant experience might have a negative impact on the manner in which the

negative impacts as previous tenants curated a more late night bar scene as opposed to a full-fledged
restaurant in order to attract business; and
v. Whereas, the eastern part of the restaurant that is adjacent to the street is a wall of operable folding
doors and there was concern that music from the interior would be heard in nearby residences; and the

the lack of knowledge of the Applicant to the specific issues of the Meatpacking District — oversaturation
of licenses and the quality of life issues this brings, that they felt most patrons will use public
transportation in an area congested with for-hire vehicles and cabs and that the Applicant thought that the
offices in their building close at 5:00 PM (it’s currently a WeWork space which does not close at 5:00)
and that the Applicant felt there are no residences to disturb despite there being residents in multiple
buildings across the street and that sound notoriously travels up and out of the area; and
iv. Whereas, the Applicant executed a stipulations agreement with CB2, Man. that they agreed to
submit to the SLA and agreed would be attached and incorporated into the method of operation on the

in this area, with 14 existing on premise licenses within 750 ft. of the subject premises, with 6 additional
on premise license pending with the NYS Liquor Authority, not to mention numerous existing beer and
wine licenses, there being concerns that this particular location with an on premise license will just

vii. Whereas, this application being subject to the 500 ft. rule requiring the applicant demonstrate a
recognizable public interest for adding yet another on premise liquor license in the area, the storefront

Hugo and Azul Rooftop, the Applicant acknowledging the Hotel’s deviation from its stipulations and
failing to provide such notice to the Community Board or the NYSLA, as required by law, but in the end

presented are accurate and complete, and that those conditions and stipulations agreed to by the Applicant
above are incorporated into the “Method of Operation” on the SLA Restaurant On Premise Liquor
License.
Vote: Unanimous, with 45 Board members in favor.
8. RH NY MP F&B, LLC d/b/a RH NY The Gallery in the Meatpacking District, 9-19 Ninth
Avenue 10014 (Alteration/Change in method of operation for Rooftop use/occupancy)
i. Whereas, the Applicants and the Applicant’s Attorney appeared before Community Board 2,
Manhattan’s SLA Licensing Committee to present an application for an alteration to its 4th floor café and
change in method of operation to its existing restaurant wine license to operate a full service rooftop
restaurant (under a temporary permit as well as permanently) on top of its five story interior decorating
and design establishment, with showrooms, a library of fabrics and furniture galleries, all of which
represent and promote the multiple Restoration Hardware brands, located in a recently altered building
(since 2017) on the corner of 9th Avenue between Little West 12th and West 13th in the historic
Meatpacking District; and,
39ii. Whereas, the existing licensed premise includes all five floors of the building including interior
rooftop restaurant and the exterior rooftop with various provisions stipulated in 2017 and clarified at the
SLA in 2018, the building being approximately 79,000 Sq. ft., this application relating only to the
removal of a bar on the third floor and for opening up the 6,149 Sq. ft. exterior rooftop space for eating
and drinking use and occupancy, where there will be 23 tables and 110 patron seats at the exterior; and,
iii. Whereas, there is an interior restaurant on the rooftop with 27 tables and 128 patron seats but
currently there is no service of alcohol to the exterior rooftop, the original presentation to CB2, Man. and
DOB filings in 2017 indicating the exterior rooftop space was being used as an accessory to or extension
of the five story decorating and design establishment to further showcase, display and highlight
Restoration Hardware’s multitude of outdoor furniture offerings; and,
iv. Whereas, the hours of operation for the interior rooftop restaurant will remain the same and are
unchanged, those hours being from 9 AM to 12 AM (or two hours after closing of gallery but no later than
12 AM), no new patrons will be admitted or seated in the 5th floor restaurant after the 1st-4th floor gallery’s
posted closing time, with the latest seating no later than 10 PM; the hours of the proposed exterior rooftop
restaurant being from 9 AM to 11PM with no new patrons admitted or seated later than 10 PM; and,
v. Whereas, during the original presentations in early 2017 at CB2, Man., Restoration Hardware made
it very clear that there would not be any food service and no tables set on the exterior rooftop and that
Restoration Hardware would not be having wait staff serving patrons on the exterior roof top terrace; and,
vi. Whereas, after that presentation Restoration Hardware failed to execute a stipulation agreement
with CB2, Man. based on its presentation and its stated method of operation for the exterior rooftop; at the
SLA Full Board hearing in July 2017 Restoration Hardware was approved limited alcohol service to the
exterior rooftop for the sole purpose of serving a client during a design consultation meeting occurring on
the exterior rooftop, that there could be no routine service of alcohol on the exterior roof; and
vii. Whereas, in August 2018 Restoration Hardware returned to the SLA full board with no prior
notification to CB2 to gain clarity regarding the service of beer/wine on the 5th floor exterior rooftop and
to relocate the café bar and seating from the 4th floor to the 3rd floor, the SLA sent them back to give
notification to CB2, Man., the item was placed on the next agenda for CB2, Man. SLA’s Licensing
Committee #2 meeting that was held on September 6, 2018, at which residents spoke against both the
relocation of the bar and service to the exterior rooftop; and
viii. Whereas, on September 2, 2018 the local Sunday NY Times newspaper contained advertising to the
public featuring a new and different method of operation for its exterior rooftop — as a wine terrace, with
the service of alcohol to seated patrons at numerous tables from wait staff in contravention with its
presentation and agreements with the Community and CB2, Man.; and,
ix. Whereas, CB2, Man. outlined to both the applicant, when they initially appeared before CB2, Man.,
and several times to the Members of the Authority its concerns with respect to the exterior rooftop
becoming a destination location; and,
x. Whereas, when Restoration Hardware last appeared before the Members of the NYS Liquor
Authority, certain restrictions were placed on the license, including a prohibition as to service of alcohol
on the exterior rooftop to patrons; and at the May 2019 SLA full board hearing regarding alcohol service
to the rooftop at another Restoration Hardware location in the Meatpacking District, members of the
40community submitted photos to the SLA of wait staff serving beer and wine to crowds of people on the
exterior rooftop at the RH Gallery (9-19 Ninth Avenue) at which time, after reprimand from the SLA,
Restoration Hardware finally agreed to stop all beverage service on the 5th floor exterior showroom; and,
xi. Whereas, the surrounding community has always been opposed to an exterior rooftop restaurant at
this location, this area already being greatly impacted by many eating and drinking establishments with
exterior premises, the application having significant impacts on those residents living in the immediate
area: and,
x. Whereas, there has been significant accommodation to this Applicant when they first met with
members of the community, through multiple meetings before CB2, Man. and before the Liquor
Authority; despite CB2’s original position, there should be no confusion that both members of the
community and CB2, Man. have ongoing opposition to additional rooftop operations in this immediate
area because rooftops, no matter their size, style of operation, create significant intrusion upon local
residents quality of life, there being a significant residential presence in the area at the roof top level,
those residents already being greatly affected by an existing, unrelenting intrusion of other rooftop eating
and drinking establishments from the Meatpacking area, the total cacophony of those impacts on a night
to night basis from the many rooftop operations on those residents living thereat, the newest rendition of
this application now presenting with a large exterior rooftop restaurant with 110 patron seats creating an
untenable and unreasonable situation where the addition of even one more rooftop such as this with
accommodations to the operator is one more license too many;
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that CB2, Man. recommends denial of the application for the
alterations and changes in method of operation as it relates to the exterior rooftop restaurant for
RH NY MP F&B LLC, d/b/a Restoration Hardware NY The Gallery, 9-19 Ninth Ave. 10003; and,
THEREFORE BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that should this application be considered by the SLA,
CB2 respectfully requests that this item be Calendared to appear before the Full Board of the SLA.
Vote: Unanimous, with 45 Board members in favor.
9. Bagatelle Downtown, LLC, 653 Hudson St. aka 18 Ninth Ave. 10014 (New OP in Gansevoort
Hotel; Restaurant with DJs/entertainment level music, retractable roof and outdoor terrace)
i. Whereas, the Applicants and the Applicant’s Attorney appeared before Community Board 2,
Manhattan’s SLA Licensing Committee to present an application for a new on premise license to operate
a restaurant with multiple DJ booths, entertainment level music, retractable roof and additional outdoor
terrace within the thirteen story (c.2003) Gansevoort Hotel on Ninth Avenue/Hudson Street between Little
West 12th / Gansevoort Street and 13th Streets in the historic Meatpacking District; and,
ii. Whereas, the Applicants are principals of the neighboring licensed premise (immediately adjacent
to the Hotel) known as Bagatelle (SN # 1143611), an all-day “dance party” brunch venue serving “boozy
brunches”, “bottle services” and providing an “exclusive” “European Friendly” atmosphere with “rosé-
soaked afternoons of reveling” using DJs with loud, booming music, establishing a constant problem
since 2009 for the surrounding neighborhood
https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/15/nyregion/thecity/15part.html?auth=login-email&login=email; and,
iii. Whereas, the proposed premises to be licensed within the Gansevoort Hotel was previously
operated as the Provocateur nightclub (God Save the King, LLC SN#1234694) generating numerous
complaints and problems over the years caused by amplified, entertainment level music using DJs
41coupled with the use of the mechanical rooftop at the premises and excessively large crowds, those
complaints and problems having been reviewed by this Community Board in 2012
http://www.nyc.gov/html/mancb2/downloads/pdf/monthly_cb2_resolutions/february_2012/02february201
2_sla.pdf, having an adverse history with the NYSLA from 2011 and from 2012, and again the subject of
violations and significant fines issued by the NYSLA against the operator on May 10, 2016 (2016-01039),
the surrounding Community being the victim of years of abusive and detrimental conduct by the Operator
and its Leaseholder, the Gansevoort Hotel; in addition to the Gansevoort Hotel’s other, multiple liquor
licenses within the same Hotel including rooftop B on Top (previously named Plunge) bar with DJs and
live music which operates until 4AM, ground floor 150-seat Restaurant (The Chester) with exterior bar
and outdoor speakers that play loud, disruptive music out towards the sidewalk, the interior of which
operates until 4AM, and all of which have produced significant complaints over the years that still
continue; and,
iv. Whereas, the proposed premises to be licensed is 11,395 sq. ft. in size with 3,176 sq. ft. cellar,
7,190 sq. ft. first floor, 1,900 sq. ft. Mezzanine and 3,900 sq. ft. exterior terrace, 70 tables with 276 patron
seats in addition to 2 stand up bars with 14 bar seats for a proposed total patron occupancy of 291; there
being three sections to the premises including Southern Terrace with retractable roof holding 24 tables
with 106 patrons seats and 1 stand up bar with 6 seats, the Northern Terrace being a fully exposed exterior
space with 11 tables and 32 patron seats, there being three sets of French Doors leading to said exterior
Northern Terrace from the Eastern side of the interior restaurant where there are an additional 35 tables
with 138 patrons seats with an additional stand up bar with 8 seats; and
v. Whereas, the proposed hours of operation are from 11 AM to 2 AM seven days a week, there will
be DJs and DJ booths located in both the Southern Terrace with retractable roof and the interior
restaurant, music will be live and at entertainment levels, there will be scheduled performances and
private parties which can include the entire interior and exterior premises, the Applicant proposing to play
“background music” within the Southern Terrace area when the rooftop is retracted and open, with no
speakers or music on the Northern Terrace, the Northern Terrace being for drinking and dining purposes
only; and,
vi. Whereas, the entry to the proposed premises to be licensed including both outdoor terraces,
including the Southern Terrace with retractable roof all face Hudson Street, where there is a significant
residential presence, with many residential buildings fully exposed to, surrounding and over-looking the
outdoor terraces and retractable roof, many of whom appeared and wrote letters in opposition to this
application, those appearing and writing in opposition objecting to the use of DJs and live music at
entertainment levels, there being a significant history of unfortunate intrusion and unreasonable late night
impacts on their lives for over a decade arising from entertainment level music at these premises, and that
given the claim that this will be a “fine dining establishment” no DJs and/or live music at entertainment
levels should be allowed anywhere in the premises, no music of any kind should be permitted in the
Southern Terrace where the retractable roof is located or exterior Northern Terrace, the French doors
should be closed by 10 pm every evening and only quiet background music should be permitted within
the interior portions of these premises; and,
vii. Whereas, when the retractable roof is opened, it exposes not only the rooftop of the premises to the
surrounding neighborhood but also retracts down a portion of the exterior walls facing out towards
Hudson Street, the exterior facades of the building structure being incorporated into the retractable roof
structure and being made of glass which is difficult to soundproof even when the roof is fully enclosed,
the method of operation of eating and drinking with DJs and entertainment level music being inconsistent
and inappropriate for this location, the prior operator at these premises, whose stated method of operation
was similar to the stated method of operation of the current Applicant, being repeatedly disciplined and
42fined for playing entertainment level music at the premises, a location which should not be utilized or
occupied in this manner in the future, especially by an known operator, whose own transgressions,
aggressive and offending method of operation in the same neighborhood has clashed with the surrounding
neighborhood for so many years; and,
viii. Whereas, no one appeared in support of this Application; and,
ix. Whereas, this Application being subject to the 500 ft. rule, wherein the Applicant must establish a
public interest for adding a new license in an area already greatly saturated with liquor licenses, there
being 38 on premise licenses within 750 ft. of the proposed location, with 7 additional on premise licenses
pending with the NYSLA in this same area, this Application with the method of operation using DJs and
entertainment levels music proposed being entirely inappropriate for this location, the premises in
question being the subject of a repetitive history of disciplinary actions and fines for the use of
entertainment level music at these same premises, the Applicant’s current method of operation being one
that is exclusive and discriminatory, with a specialized reservation system, its high-end brunches to a
remarkable level of indulgence and expense in which eggs benedict is routinely washed down by an
seemingly endless stream of mimosas, bloody marys and $500 bottles of champagne, where its patrons
routinely dance on tables and chairs to music that is so loud it can be heard through the building’s facades
and front door to the outside, where its patrons leave the high-end brunches and vomit in the immediately
surrounding streets; and,
x. Whereas, there also concerns voiced regarding the volume of traffic on Hudson Street where the
multiple entrances to the premises face a “no standing anytime” zone and a bus stop where MTA buses
are routinely located and parked on a temporary basis, the area already having significant traffic control
problems especially in the late afternoons / evenings when the Meatpacking District becomes a
destination location for tourists and out-of-area guests due to the numerous eating and drinking venues;
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that CB2, Man. recommends denial for Bagatelle Downtown,
LLC, 653 Hudson St. aka 18 Ninth Ave. 10014 on its application seeking a new On Premise license;
and
THEREFORE BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that should this application be considered by the SLA,
CB2, Man. respectfully requests that this item be Calendared to appear before the Full Board of the SLA;
and,
THEREFORE BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that if this application is considered by the SLA,
despite CB2, Manhattan’s recommendation to deny this application, CB2, Man. requests that the SLA
conduct a 500-foot hearing because the premises has never been licensed for the service of alcohol at any
point in the past.

TRAFFIC AND TRANSPORTATION
Resolution requesting improvements to enhance safety and use on Open Streets.
Whereas, CB2, Man. thanks the NYC Dept. of Transportation (DOT) for providing an update on the
installation and operation of Open Streets in CB2 and for participating in CB2's question and answer
session addressing the Open Streets program; and
Whereas, concerns were voiced about the operation, effectiveness and design of the barriers/barricades
used at the start and end of the Open Street closures, among them:
• Drivers do not put back the metal barriers (which are provided in some cases, while in others,
heavier wooden barriers are used) after moving them aside to enter.
• The wooden barriers are heavy and difficult to move when necessary.
45• Incentives are needed to motivate those driving in to replace barriers where they were.
• Simple gates that lower and raise, such as those used in Berlin and other German cities and towns,
might
• be more effective.; and
Whereas it was observed that the signage that DOT provides is limited in both size and the extent of
guidelines included plus difficult to see and read, and that larger, clearer signage is needed to alert drivers
to put barriers back in place as well as to clarify that only drivers who belong on the Open Street (because
they're local to the street or are needed service or emergency vehicles) are allowed to enter, and also to
more prominently display the 5 mph speed limit and other restrictions; and
Whereas it was noted that careful thought and application is needed to avoid conflicts between outdoor
space allocation in the upcoming street dining program and street space allocation for pedestrians' and
bicyclists' safe physical distancing in the Open Streets program; and
Whereas there were questions about protecting Open Street users, such as pedestrians, and children
playing, from careless drivers who might enter the Open Street; and
Whereas a definition of the ideal Open Street was requested as a guide to installation;
Therefore be it resolved that CB2, Man. encourages DOT to investigate other options for Open Street
barriers that facilitate moving them back in place when drivers move them aside and are easier to
manipulate, whether automated, as in gates that rise and lower or arm barriers, or manual, such as through
swing barrier gates or lifts, with an eye to installing alternatives as soon as possible; and
Be it further resolved that should alternative barriers not be workable, CB2, Man. asks DOT to consider
instituting incentives to motivate drivers who enter Open Streets to put back the barriers they move, either
positively (e.g. reward program) or punitively (e.g. ticketing), in either case by installing cameras
documenting drivers' actions; and
Be it further resolved that CB2, Man. urges DOT to develop bigger, more visible, colorful signage that
clearly delineates the rules governing entry into Open Streets and possible penalties for ignoring them,
with use in some cases of illustrations; and
Be it further resolved that CB2, Man. fully supports an outdoor dining program, considering it critical to
the survival of our many eating and drinking establishments, and also requests that careful attention be
given to balancing the needs of both diners and non-diners by establishing clear guidelines for space
allocation, use and management that ensures that diners have adequate space for safe distancing and
comfortable dining at the same time pedestrians and bicyclists have adequate open and safe passage; and
Be it further resolved that CB2, Man. asks for safeguards to be allowed and put in place in Open Streets
(along with guidance) that may include traffic calming devices such as planters and other types of
diverters like those used in woonerfs, as well as markers and temporary cones, all to slow down drivers
and direct them away from and promote the protection of the various non-drivers using the street; and
Be it finally resolved that CB2, Man. recognizes the need for and supports the development of
parameters that define an ideal Open Street (in addition to the DOT guidelines that emphasize where
Open Streets cannot occur and what kind of limited traffic is allowed on them), including such features as
46use group, street and sidewalk dimensions, parking allocation, existing infrastructure (e.g. bike lanes),
amenities and greenery, as well as different suitable typologies, to guide those interested in applying for
Open Streets.
Vote: Passed, with 44 Board Members in favor, and 1 in opposition (D. Diether).
