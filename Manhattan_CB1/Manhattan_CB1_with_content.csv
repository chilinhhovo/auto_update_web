fellow stakeholders in your communities and identify priority concerns that have a negative
impact on the quality of life where you and your neighbors live. The Mayor’s Community

various city agencies and representative’s offices.
● I am working with the Office of District Attorney Alvin Bragg to schedule a time for Mr.
Bragg or a senior person on his staff to come speak with the Board about his policy revision.
Stay tuned for that.
● Earlier this week all of the Manhattan District Managers met with Borough President Levine
to discuss community board needs from the perspective of staff. I am happy to say that as a
former member of CB 12, he understood our needs and promised to fight for our funding this
upcoming fiscal year.
● Two weeks ago the District Managers met with the Commissioner of the Mayors Community
Affairs Unit. We are very hopeful as simply sitting down with us is already a 180 degree turn
from the last administration. Hopefully we will have more news to report in the near future on
this.

140 Broad Street
Friendly amendment accepted
During the March 20, 2018 LPC public hearing on 140 Broadway, several of the LPC
Commissioners went on record opposing the addition of benches at the west side of the plaza
despite their understanding
that the Broadway edge was not part of LPC’s purview. The commissioners hoped that DOT
would listen to the LPC proceedings in advance of their decision. see:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQkqf67D0ckCB
Relocating food trucks along or on the sidewalks at Cedar and Liberty Streets was not presented
to LPC in 2018 during their public hearing on the proposed modifications to the plaza.
The addition of benches along the Broadway side of 140 Broadway was opposed by all of the
City’s primary preservation groups, including the MAS, HDC, Docomomo, Landmarks
Conservancy in addition to CB 1 in 2018. (spell out group names)
City Comptroller, Scott Stringer's Audit of NYC POPS in 2017 indicated that 140 Broadway was
not in compliance with POPS regulations at that time. The audit indicated a violation resulting
from cars parked on the POPS on Liberty Street.

vehicles that are left idling by the driver while they pop in a store.
● December 25, 2021, Christmas Day and January 1, 2022, New Year’s Day both fall on

the next meeting will show significant progress so we can have a safe solution in hand before
the first day of school next year.
● Last week I testified before the Civic Engagement Commission about how community
boards need them to weigh in on the issue of open meetings law reform as one of their core
projects to protect and expand engagement citywide. The board of the Civic Engagement
Commission seemed receptive, but more pressure will likely be necessary.

○ S8140B passed for rental relief. Bill will help homeless New Yorkers survive

resolution from CB1 to support the at-risk residents who are being pushed out
because of 421A.
● Luis Rojas
○ Also, a tenant at 225 Rector. Tenants at 225 Rector have fought for years with

choose that time to make an adversarial action to CB1’s homeless as well as

that aren't exactly clear.

III. Business Session
A) Adoption of December 2018 minutes were adopted as presentedB) District Manager’s Report – L. Reynolds
a. Hope Count - The 2019 HOPE Count is coming up on January 28th from 10 PM to 4
AM. For those of you just hearing about this for the first time, HOPE stands for
Homeless Outreach Population Estimate. It is an annual point-in-time survey of New
Yorkers sleeping unsheltered on the streets and subways. The counting is performed by
City employees and incredible volunteers. If you wish to take action on this, please visit
NYC.GOV/HOPE or call 311 for more information on how to get involved.
b. The government shutdown continues to impact the lives of people all around us in
Community District 1. We know the direct impact the shutdown is taking on Federal
Employees, many live and work around you in the district. We are still waiting to hear
the final impact of the shutdown on those who receive federal benefits from the
department of agriculture, such as EBT or through HUD, such as section 8.
c. MDC public plaza - Back in August of 2018, the Councilmember called one of the first
community meetings around the MDC. The meeting was attended by a number of
administration officials, including the Chief of Staff of the Department of Corrections.
That was the first time I heard that the parking lot in front of the MDC is actually a public
plaza. In fact, I'm told that the plaza was part of the community benefits agreement for
the first MDC. This lead me to start counting how long it would take for someone to step
up to the plate and return this plaza back to the community from under the wheels of
scores of commuter vehicles. As of today, five months have passed since that meeting
and I will continue keeping track until that plaza is clear. If past promises wont be kept,
how can anyone expect anything different this time around?
d. Fashion Week Walkthrough - Last week I attended a walkthrough of the area that will be
used for the Fashion Week Street Activity Permit that the board voted on last month. I
used the opportunity to echo board concerns about pedestrian clearance by the tent, signs
warning people about said difficulties to allow them to plot a different course, and
making sure that access to St. Johns Lane from Beach Street was not impeded in any
way. The applicants had already incorporated those concerns into their plan and the
Mayors Office of Citywide Events was very supportive of our perspective.
e. BMCC Pool Reopens to the Community - After years of renovation, the pool at BMCC is
once again open to community use. It doesn't appear to be free, but there are significant
discounts for people over the age of 65.
C) Treasure’s Report – J. Kopel – Report was emailed out and no significant changes
contact the office or me if you have additional questions.

the survey widely and participate. This is important to participate for the future of
Wagner Park.
xii. Re: MDC
1. Jan Lee – Chinatown Core Block Association – Questions that have been asked
have not been answered. No plan or location has been identified yet for where the
displaced families will go, no plan for how long construction will take, only a
feasibility study to be done for what they will do with mental health patients (no
plans yet),
2. Nancy Kong – NUBC and President of Chatham Towers - We understand the
people who want to close Rikers and we are asking for the same courtesy and
respect for our positions. We ask for the CB to vote NO to this plan. There are
already 1026 beds but they want to increase the number by an additional 700 beds
– that is untenable for the neighborhood.
3. Charlie Lai – Chung PAK – Association of small, businesses and non-profits. We
are fighting for smaller and more responsive Jail system – we understand that
Rikers Island is way too massive and so is this new building/jail and the city has
not been responsive to the community.
4. Paulo Yung – resident of Chinatown. The scale and scope of this building is out
of proportion of the community. Concerned 1400 -1700 residents and the chaos
of what happens when the elevators are off line or security incidents.5. Derrick Biney - Amissah – White Street Resident for more than 20 years. His
wife has been in the area over 80 years. Community has not been included and
the process is being rushed; city is disconnected between morality or their “moral
urgency” and the logistics – what is the real reform being done to the process –
how does a building solve the moral errors that have been created.
6. Howard Huie – Resident and Board Member of Chatham Towers – There is no
integration into the scope and scale of the community. This building will be
larger than the Ghery Building and the City has said they are modeling the Denver
facility – but that building is 4 times smaller and significantly smaller. This is an
untested concept and I ask that CB1 vote NO to this plan.
7. Eric Dillenberger – Walker Street Block Association – we have had hundreds of
years of jails in our neighborhood. However, this is way off the mark for the
scale and scope based on their experience of the City’s mistakes thus far. We
have lived with every mistake and experiment and we know this is not the place
to try and learn along the way.
8. Anna Leong – resident of Park Row – The close Rikers concept is not justice or
jail reform – it is a logistical and cosmetic change. This is a bait and switch
scheme – find the solutions to deal with to create more smaller jails – not this
mega jail; how to handle people with mental illness; find transportation solutions;
add a courthouse to Rikers; Add more Judges – reform the system now do not
build cosmetic fixes.
9. Joseph Mirabella – Park Row Alliance – The prison is too large for the
community. I feel the City Councilperson is now a lame duck and has not
supported publically those that elected her. The sessions have been allowed to get
out of hand and make me fearful. Global Solutions has been stalking those that
speak out against the jails.
10. Irving Lee – Chinatown Residents- This process is a focus on development and
real estate and not focused on the problems with the system nor Justice Reform.
The development community if looking for the 47 acres for development.
11. Carrie Smith – Jails do not serve the local community in any manner nor really
the people within it, we cannot fail our communities by building $10Billion work
of new facilities vs working on the system.
12. Bruce Ehrman – The city needs to look into whether or not Global Solutions is
harassing those that opposition. We need to vote down this resolution due to its
lack of merit on the construction.
13. Dorothy Thom – afraid to speak publically so submitted a note.
xiii. Caroline Miller – Expansion of the Seaport Historic District – please vote to support the
community now so that the resiliency plans that are being developed ensure that theseaport is still connected to the water and the views remain. We do not want walls of
buildings – we want public usage and space.
II. Adoption of March 2019 minutes were adopted as presented.
III. District Manager’s Report – L. Reynolds
a. Tour of Lower Manhattan with a delegation from Haarlem in the Netherlands.
b. Working with the The Things Network to get small sensors to measure sound and air quality.
c. Meeting on Aggressive Ticket Sellers in The Battery
d. NYPD – Staten Island Ferry Terminal will be taken over by a Staten Island Police Department
and no longer be part of the 1st Precinct. Lucian will try to find out where the defining line will
be.
e. DDC Work – Please make sure that all work concerns are brought to the CB office.
f. Phones in the offices will be changing to VOIP vs standard lines now.
IV. Treasure’s Report – J. Kopel
a. Increase by about $6k in personnel; $15k excess and office will investigate how best to use the
money. We are still working on our one time funded grant: looking at updating the IT and other
areas. No irregularities.

i. Deborah Kasner about 121 Chambers Street Ownership; re: 74-711 application
seeking approval on restoration of façade and addition of one floor. Landmarks
Preservation Commission (LPC) has issued a certificate of appropriateness.
j. Timothy Harrell – NYC Civilian Complaint Review Board – we are a separate
unit from NYPD. We have public board meetings each month. We invite the
community to come attend these meetings. We also do seminars at schools and
local organizations. Please note that this is up for review with the charter revision
as well.
k. Christopher Marte – State Committee Update & Borough Based Jails (Manhattan
Detention Complex) – Working with the state to change voting rules on when you
need to register in order to be able to vote. Speaking against the Borough Based
Jails (Manhattan Detention Complex) plan– applauding the work CB1 has done
and asking the full board to vote against this proposal.
l. Re: Borough Based Jails (Manhattan Detention Complex) –
i. Vidal Guzman Justice League USA – speaking to support closing of
Rikers;
ii. Maureen Silverman – Wants a full vote of no with no options. Do not
build a new jail.
iii. Jonathan Hollander – As Battery Dance Company Director, he believes
that the proposed detention complex will the block light and air of the
dance studio and disrupt free movement between Chinatown and the Civic
Center.
iv. Lynn Ellsworth – New Borough Based Jails (Manhattan Detention
Complex) plan is fiscally irresponsible, ethically irresponsible, ULURP
process is a charade, no community can get a fair hearing at the current
City Planning Commission, the arguments for new jails are based on
architectural arguments, a state jail on 110th Street is being sold.
v. Anthony Sperbuti – Asking the Community Board to delay weighing until
a proper impact study can be performed.
vi. Devon Woodley – Urging the community to help close Rikers Island.
vii. Eric Dillenberger – Walker Street Business Assoc. – The Borough Based
Jails (Manhattan Detention Complex) plan scale and location is not right
for the community. The only right thing about this is the conversation ofchange needed in the system. This should not be a land use discussion but
a process discussion on change in how things are done.
viii. Jan Lee – Chinatown Resident representing Neighbors United Below
Canal – This is really not a way to have improvements until changes are
made in the system first. Thank you for the work the Land Use
Committee has done reading all of the documentation. How can we trust
those saying they will monitor the effects on the neighborhood when the
commissioner in charge of NYCHA admitted to ignoring the problems of
the most vulnerable
ix. Howard Huie – Neighbors United Below Canal/ Chatham Towers – Was
present at the neighborhood advisory council when the city said if you
want more community aspects they would have to build a bigger building
which shows how tone deaf they are to what the community is saying -
please support the committee vote.
x. Stephan Freid – See handout for facts on testimony; please support the
Land Use Committee and vote no on this action which changes the fabric
of the neighborhood and all of the zoning forever.
xi. Nabil Hassein – Please vote NO completely because building more jails
does not solve the issues.
xii. Jeanie Chin – Chatham Towers – Chinatown is sandwiched between 3
jails and since 9/11 - Chinatown has suffered the overwhelming security,
closure of sidewalks, transportation and streets which caused the closure
of several businesses. This was told to the community it was because of
one of the Jails and not 1 PP – we are tired of being “collateral damage”.
xiii. Mamak Shahbazi – White Street resident – A giant mega jail that looks
nice will not solve the problem of the process. We should be looking at
fixing the due process for the people arrested before more jails are built.
xiv. Karen Lew – longtime resident in lower Manhattan – The mayor’s office
has not done the proper community outreach to solve the bail process. Do
the due diligence of working on change before the city spends billions on
construction.
xv. Lauren Gore – Funds should be set up for helping people with services
needed and bail. Rebuild the buildings on Rikers to build new facilities
there to support a small jail – not building a new one in Lower Manhattan
xvi. Derrick Biney-Amissah – Local resident asking the CB to vote against the
current Borough Based Jails (Manhattan Detention Complex) proposal. A
no vote is a check and balance to the mayor’s office and demonstrates a
community standing up to demand a better use of the $11billion project.The stated needs of the scale is no longer relevant and reform needs to be
planned before the buildings.
xvii. Diana Tse – Chinatown resident who asking the whole board to support
the NO vote on this project. Speaking as a mother in the neighborhood –
we need the parks and areas for children to be protected and not negatively
affected by a building that is out of scale for the neighborhood.
xviii. Patricia Tsai – Lin Sing Association – representing several organizations
in lower Manhattan for 100 years. We want real reform in programs and
implementation of those programs which will result in less needs for
space. It is immoral to build a huge building before this is done and spend
so much money. One UULURP per construction site is the proper way to
move forward not this combined flawed process.
xix. Don Lee – CB1 resident – Put the money into the programs and reforms
instead of building a mega jail and spending the money. No New Jails –
spend on the programs helping the people.
xx. Daniel Schwartz – representing the workers inside jails – Do not build
new jails – work on reform. There are no such things as nice jails and if
they build it – they will fill it.
xxi. Brittany Williams – No New Jails Coalition and Black Lives Matter
OnLine; We do not support the building of new jails. The ULURP
process is based on the larger jails which should not be supported. The
Mayor is termed out and will not be present to ensure reform happens vs a
development project. We encourage you to vote no entirely and spend the
money in programs instead.
m. Margot Olavarria – The River Project – Meet the Fishes at Pier 40. Please come
June 4th from 4pm to 7pm for our free event and enjoy snacks and meet the sea
life of the Hudson River.
n. Alejandra Catas – Keep FiDi Safe – Urging the CB to not support the new club,
18 William LLC at 20 Exchange Place which will bring upwards of 1000 people
per night to the neighborhood.
II. Business Session
A) Adoption of April 2019 minutes were adopted as presented.
B) District Manager’s Report – L. Reynolds
a. Last week I did a Financial District walkthrough of commercial parking issues and
trash setout issues with NCO Miles and the President of the 3 Hanover Square Board
of Directors.b. Today I Contacted FDNY to investigate reports of 911 dispatch mishandling
emergency service requests in Battery Park City, specifically on South End Avenue
(Thank you Tammy)
c. Finally, I'd like to present the Board and all of our guests with a breakdown of how
the office spent the $42.5k temporary budget increase. CB 1 followed the guidance of
City Council Governmental Operations Chair, Fernando Cabrera by focusing our
spending on goods and services that will expand the capacity of the office so that we
can do more for the district with the amount of staff time that we have available to us.
I will note that CB 1 does not currently own a vehicle, nor have we owned a vehicle
while I have been on staff. No member of the staff is the holder of any kind of
parking placard, nor do we have any plan to solicit one. We get around the district by
foot, by bicycle and by public transit.

A) Adoption of May 2019 minutes were adopted as presented.
B) District Manager’s Report – L. Reynolds
• Today I’d like to start by following up on my conversation with FDNY over 911
response on South End Avenue. They did find that only the abbreviated version of the
street name existed in one of their databases and are making a fix. I was also asked to
check on North End Avenue so I will report back on that at the July meeting.• The office is always looking for ways to work with BMCC and this month, we found
a way to make the Community Board a civics classroom for the student of Dr.
Oloremi Alapo’s course on local government. During the Fall semester many of you
will start seeing new faces as students observe the workings of the community board.
• Lastly, I made contact with the NYPD Counterterrorism Unit to have them check
over some of the DDC/Con Ed work at key locations in our district. I urge all of you
to be like the CB member that raised the concern because collectively, CB 1 members
know their district better than any single government employee.

trying to safeguard the investigation into the President by Special CounselMueller. There is a plan in DC to disparage the FBI and the investigation. We

Rosenstein, the number two who is really in charge of Mueller who is an
independent investigator. Not certain that the Gateway Project will actually come
to fruition with this President in Office. The new tax system does penalize the

Our office will always be interested in working with any organization that wants
to make the public more aware of the work that community board members are
doing to make Lower Manhattan a better place to live and do business. I'll look

9/11 Memorials to apply for grant funds. Working on helicopter rules and regulations for NY and

 Assembly member Deborah Glick – The Mayor has commissioned a ballot question on Charter
Changes – 1 question has to do with reducing the amount of contributions a city official can
receive but increase an amount of tax payer dollars can be applied to officials which increases their
revenue and impacts tax dollars; another questions is to give term limits to Community Board
Members but this can negatively affect qualified community advocates and the plan would give
money and options to special interests and contractors. 3rd question is a commission on civic
engagement which in her opinion is counterproductive to the process of community boards. Sets up
a commission to replace the current input process.

I. Public Hearing
Community Board 1 Capital and Expense Budget Requests for FY 2020
Michael Kramer – Save our Seaport would like to thank CB 1 for making the Seaport
Museum a priority and hopes they will continue to do so for the budget through the
District Needs Statement.
II. Public Session
 Maryam Abdul-Aleem from Assemblymember Deborah Glick’s office – The Mayor has
commissioned a ballot question on Charter Changes – 1 question has to do with reducing the
amount of contributions a city official can receive but increase an amount of tax payer dollars
that can be applied to officials which increases their revenue and impacts tax dollars; another
questions is to give term limits to Community Board Members but this can negatively affect
qualified community advocates and the plan would give money and options to special
interests and contractors. 3rd question is a commission on civic engagement which in her
opinion is counterproductive to the process of community boards. Sets up a commission to
replace the current input process.
o Please see her position on each ballot question on the flyers and her website.
 Ranger Jim, supervisor of African Burial Ground, Federal Hall, and Castle Clinton in Battery
Park; Come visit and live through its important history; lots of activities and rangers will be
giving tours.
 Group on 80 Centre Street/Manhattan Detention Complex: Nicholas Stabile (President,
Chatham Towers) representing Neighbors United Below Canal
o Thank you for the resolution last month on MANHATTAN DETENTION
COMPLEX and the landmark resolution this month regarding 80 Centre Street. We
support both.o Not enough public input in the expedited process.

 Diane Brown – South Street Seaport Museum – Advocating for the restoration and expansion
of the Museum.
 Graeme Birchall – Downtown Boathouse – come join us and try boating for free on the
Hudson. This is not the best time to come to the River – please support the boathouse by
advocating for the beach on the east side.
 Peter Nguyen from NYS Assembly Member Yuh-Line Niou – We distributed copies of our
testimony on 2 Bridges and 80 Center Street.
 Cora Fung, Council Woman Chin’s office – PS 150 is a major focus we are working on with
the community. Governor’s Island meeting (Sept 26) went well and she is encouraging
everyone to work with CB1 and MBPO for new jobs and schools and all of the ideas for
Governors Island Trust. L Train shut down will be impacting CB1 – please participate in the
forums. Senior Center bill will ensure the food areas are inspected. Medicare open
enrollment is upcoming for those aged 65 and up. There are no fees for the new cards – even

 Hannah Weinerman from Congressman Nadler’s office - 9/11 Compensation Fund is

 Police Officer Brian Kenny from NYPD Transit Dist. 02 representing 8 others who are with

regarding the proposal to co-name West Broadway at Lispenard Street after James
McNaughton . Please support the resolution to allow it to be co-named.
 Julia Udell – West Broadway & Lispenard resident regarding the co-naming of the street;
Against it on the basis of precedent, it was asked to be named for a local abolitionist twice
and turned down. This does not improve but make the logistics of transportation worse for
drivers as there are already many signs and adding one more is confusing to locals. Lastly,
Julia believes a better honor could be a bench or tree.

Reviewed programming and special discounts – please come visit and see all of what we
offer.

amount of light being used daily. Amy Brooks Snider – Resident of South Bridge Towers – The parking lot that Howard
Hughes Corporation has purchased (250 Water St) should be considered part of their plan
and we should stand as a community together to demand more open and green spaces and not
accept the idea of a tower on that lot. The schools and community need green spaces.
 Nichoas Sbordone – Resiliency Meetings will be upcoming for both the Southern BPC and
The Ballfields. Congrats to Nick on his new Baby!

victory this week. Capital funding has been approved for schools, playgrounds
and seniors. This upcoming year we will work on placard parking especially in

send out a letter with a number of clarifying questions to help us understand the
design and reason for this council.

generation for discretionary approvals.

meeting with DDC, Con Ed and many representatives for our elected officials to
discuss the issues identified in November's Worth Street walkthrough as well as a

productive and allowed DDC and Con Ed to better prepare themselves to meet the

the community since the last meeting as well as continued planning for future
work impacts.

Trump Administration and how it may affect NYC.
 Becky White – Senator Squadron’s office – The Senator continues to press for
the closing of the LLC loophole in Albany; the Senator is still advocating
along with Assembly Member Glick for a majority of community residents on
the Battery Park City Authority Board.

o Deadline approaching to sign up for health coverage under the
Affordable Care Act. Sign up before January 31st.
o Governor Cuomo signed a bill making it illegal to advertise illegal
short-term rentals online. The Assembly Member testified recently in
favor of a steep penalty for people who disregard this law.
 Ranger Jim – National Parks Service and Federal Hall - Please visit the
National Parks and attend the special events at the African Burial Grounds
from December 27 through the 30th celebrating Kwanza, all of which are free.
 Art Gingras – Site Safety Manager for the construction project at 24 Leonard
Street. Special after-hours variances were approved for night and weekend

hours. There will be no further Sunday variances. People are welcome to visit
the site and ask questions.
 Jim Hopkins from Manhattan Youth – Manhattan Youth Downtown
Community Center programs go beyond after-school and include holiday and

 Mariama James – WTC clinic eligibility borderline is south of Houston Street
(border for 9/11 fund is south of Canal Street); event hosted last weekend was
co-hosted by Gale Brewer and 9/11 Environmental Action and featured JohnStewart and John Feal. Eligibility is based on whether you were here working
or living in the neighborhood on 9/11 – even if you live in another state.
 Judy Levine - Board Vice Chair of Church Street School of Music and Art –
Please come to the fundraiser January 4th. The school’s lease is expiring and
the renewal cost is too high. The landlord is not helping them find a viable
way to renew. As a non-profit they cannot afford to rent in the neighborhood
any longer without help. They are trying to raise $300k to be able to put
down a deposit on a new space before the end of January. They need help in
order to continue to provide valuable programs to youth from the area and
beyond.

building has been supported by all of the local officials and CB1
Landmarks Committee hosted a meeting to discuss how strongly the
community wants to preserve the building and to extend the Tribeca
East Historic District to protect it. The Trust supports the reuse of the
entire building for affordable housing. Dismayed to hear that the
building will be demolished for a tower with monies to go to
Downtown Community Television Center instead of the greater good
of the community.
o Gerald Forsburg – Need to preserve this beautiful building and add
affordable housing. The area does not need more luxury buildings and
high-end retail.
o Briar Winters – Member of the NYC Real Estate Investment
Cooperative. How can we preserve community space in this building
and affordable space for business growth through the community land
trust model? We need to maintain a balanced neighborhood for all.
o Bill Duggan – Professor at Columbia and here to advocate for the
preservation of this building. We need to look at this as a death by
1000 cuts. This should be 100% affordable housing, set forever, that
will preserve the history of our city.
o Eileen Herman passed her time to Hal Bromm and said only that she
supports all the testimony given so far.
o Hal Bromm – Historic Districts Council – former CB1 Member – this
is a noteworthy pair of buildings that should both be protected. We
need affordable housing and these are city buildings so it is a win for
everybody.
o Alex Lloyd –Lives at 35 White and knows the neighborhood and its
historic buildings and special character. The modern buildings change
the landscape and character and without a doubt the buildings that
retain the special historic qualities should be preserved.
 Lucille Songhai – from MBP Gale Brewer’s office –
o CB Applications time again, you can apply online or by mail.o A diaper drive has been started with the Food Bank of NY – please
donate directly to the office or online through Amazon. Drive ends on

 Bruce Ehrmann (CB1): has the community board taken a position on this? Answer:
the community board supported the idea of the concept of a NID roughly 4 months
ago. Nothing has been done on this specific proposal. A resolution might appear from CB1 in April, May, or June. There is no map
available. It will be developed within the next few months.

surrounding areas.

keep track of all information on the NID.

2) Storm Recovery Loan Program – Report
 See above.
3) Task Force to Review CB1 Committee Structure – Report
Due to the crowded CB1 meeting calendar, the first meeting of the Task Force to Review CB1
Committee Structure was noticed and held as part of the Executive Committee meeting held on
February 20, 2013. At that meeting, Anthony Notaro made a presentation that was subsequently
distributed to all Board members. The presentation framed the question as follows:
• What constitutes a reasonable number of committees?
• What is the district office’s capacity to support the work of the committees?
• Does each committee have a clear goal, portfolio, or set of charter-mandated
responsibilities?
• What criteria should be used when evaluating a committee – number of members,
attendance at meetings, number of meetings held in a year, resolutions adopted and
other work product?
The presentation also outlined relevant provisions of the City Charter and the Board’s By-Laws
relating to the duties of the Chair, including the duty to create standing committees of the Board
as needed for the effective operation of the Board, as well as such sub-committees and task
forces as may from time to time be deemed necessary and to appoint, suspend or remove chairs,
vice chairs, and members of committees of the Board, and benchmarking information, including
a comparison of different community board geographic and subject matter committees, statistics
relating to the number of meetings held by, attendance at and resolutions passed by the former
Waterfront and Housing Committees.
All interested members of the Board and public were welcome to attend and express their views.
Among the possible recommendations discussed were the following:
• The proposed elimination of two other Task Forces: BPC Community Center and Arts
& Entertainment. It was agreed that Arts & Entertainment, which was previously
chaired by Harold Reed, should be eliminated but that further thought should be givenas to how best to address issues previously dealt with by the Ball Fields Taskforce as
well as waterfront, parks and open space concerns.
• The need for a process for regularly reviewing community needs in relation to the
committee structure of the board with a focus by each committee on annual objectives
as well as a process for reviewing and approving the extension of subcommittees and
taskforces on an annual basis.
• Consideration of possible alternative ways to address issues previously covered by
eliminated committees such as addressing housing issues in the Planning Committee
and human services issues in the Quality of Life Committee.
No formal recommendations were made at the meeting other than that the Arts & Entertainment
Taskforce should be eliminated. As was discussed at the meeting, there are reasonable
arguments for and against having a stand-alone Housing Committee but the decision is properly
within the Chair’s authority to make a judgment one way or the other. There will be additional
opportunity to discuss these issues at the next meeting of the Executive Committee, following
which the Executive Committee, taking into account the views expressed by Board members and
the community, will make any recommendations it sees fit to the Chair.

Addendum, By Vice Chair A. Notaro
Borough Board President Scott Stringer Monthly Meeting - Two resolutions impacting CB1
were presented for voting. (1) East Midtown Zoning with a vote of 16-0-2 so the affirmative vote
rejected the zoning change. CB#1 voted yes. (2) Civic Center Sale (ULURP) came to a vote with
the elected officials and only CB1 able to vote. 49-51 Chambers and 346 Broadway were
presented as separate resolutions that were identical except for landmark wording for 49-51
Chambers and CB1 school seat issues and 346 Broadway had wording about the media center
and build-out funding for Community Facility. Both passed with a 10-0-2, with CB1 abstaining.
346 Broadway will be the first minority development company south of 110 Street. (July 18,
2013)
Mayor’s Office 346 Broadway Conference Call - The Mayor’s Office notified CB1 that there
was a technical issue with the sale of 346 Broadway. The building has a parking garage for about
100 cars that received its special permit by the original owner in 1958. When the City purchased
the building it never renewed the permit, which expired in 1971, but it continued to operate the
facility as parking garage. The new buyers found this lien in a title search and made this a
condition of sale or the sale price would be reduced and our media center could be eliminated.
Their request for us was to waive our right to review this Board of Standards and Appeals
Application for renewal of the Special Permit (not ULURP) to allow the garage to continue in
use. Due to timing issues, CB1 agreed based on city officials being here tonight to answer
questions. (July 19, 2013)
NYC Economic Development Corporation, Office of Long Term Planning & Sustainability -
NYCEDC invited CB1 and CB3 to a briefing on the implementation of the Southern
Manhattan plan from the City’s “A Stronger, More Resilient New York” Report (SIRR). We

completed by December 2013. (July 25, 2013)

listed in resolutions pertaining to the hiring of staff members and salary increases. Such

MANHATTAN COMMUNITY BOARD #1
MANHATTAN YOUTH
DOWNTOWN COMMUNITY CENTER
120 WARREN STREET
JANUARY 24, 2012
Public Session
Robert Townley – Manhattan Youth
Welcome to Downtown Community Center which started 14 years ago. There has been
tremendous growth, but there are challenges ahead.
Alec Schierenbeck – Borough President Scott Stringer’s Representative
All CB applications are now in and being processed. Interviews begin in February. The Borough
President recently stood with CB#1 on the mayoral proposal for EDC to sell three buildings in
Lower Manhattan. Public uses of these properties should be considered first. We need school
seats and public benefits to be a primary concern in this decision.
The City Charter gives the Manhattan Borough Board some leverage in this process.
The Borough President is also asking the Board to vote on a resolution regarding the NYPD Stop
and Frisk program. He believes there could be a better strategy that doesn't violate people’s
rights. Most people stopped are people of color and over 99% of the time, the cops do not find a
weapon.
Paul Goldstein – Speaker Silver's Representative
The Speaker hosted a meeting with new PANYNJ Executive Director Patrick Foye and CB#1
members covering issues including the Performing Arts Center, WTC retail space and impacts
from construction noise. He was pleased by the appointment of the PAC board and happy that
Julie was named to it. Also, he emphasized the LMCCC’s role in addressing noise issues.
He spoke at the State of the State about the Living Wage initiative. The Speaker also focused on
school space within the three city buildings which may be put up for sale.
Noise from construction projects on John Street (Broadway & Nassau) has become a significant
concern particularly on weekends. Also, the Speaker is focusing on noise form the Brooklyn
Bridge work. Local residents have complained about the nightly noise. Senator Squadron and
Council Member Chin have co-signed a letter about this.
John Ricker – Comptroller Liu's RepresentativeBest wishes for the New Year. He told us to go on the comptroller's website. Doesn't yet have
any information about the monies associated with the CityTime project overruns.
Celine Mizrahi - Congressman Nadler’s Representative
Congress is back in session. The Congressman has been instrumental in securing dollars for NY
infrastructure. The WTC Victims Compensation Fund has opened. You can call her office for
information about eligibility. The Zagroda bill does not cover cancer but they are working on
including this provision.
Jennifer Rajkumar – Democratic District Leader
She has been working to encourage youth involvement in the political process and going to
meetings around the city concerning this and other matters.
Also took the BPC CERT Personal Safety class, which is excellent.
Jared Brown – Resident
Spoke about a proposed liquor store in Southbridge Towers. Asked that the resolution on the
agenda be tabled and reopened for discussion at the next month’s committee meeting.
Betsy Nebel-Schainholz – VP of Southbridge Towers
The SBT management is working to improve the appearance of Southbridge and the proposed
wine and spirits store could be beneficial. The area is growing and this will provide needed retail.
Key Foods now sells single bottles of beer and no problems have been noted. The park is safe
and no problems with drinking have been observed there.
Ronald Guggenheim – Southbridge Treasurer
He is involved in the lease negotiations for the proposed store and no information has been
released. This will be a high-end wine and spirits store and not a discount store and will also
service the new Gehry building. The store will pay market rent and make substantial
improvements to the space.
Paul Kefer – Assistant Treasurer at Southbridge Towers
There was a unanimous approval to process with negotiations regarding a lease for the proposed
store.
Claudia Byrd – Southbridge resident
Objects to the proposed 5,000 square feet store. Doesn't believe there has been transparency on
this issue.Ashley Voroba, Megan Ahearn & Matt Ryder – NYC Coalition for a Smoke Free City
Have been to several community boards to discuss surveys about how tobacco has been
marketed in pharmacies. They found that independent pharmacies have mostly stopped selling
tobacco but many large chain stores continue. This coalition is very focused on the impact of
tobacco marketing on NYC youth. They all spoke in favor of the resolution on the CB1 agenda.
Arthur Piccolo - Resident
Spoke about $468,000 spent by the NYPD for security for the Bull sculpture at Bowling Green.
He complained about this and believes it results from Occupy Wall Street and he says this is
nonsense. He asked the CB to take a stand against this.
Rafael Martin – Soho Repertory Theater
They are on Walker Street. Urged everyone to come and support arts in our neighborhood.
Ranger Jim – National Park Service
Spoke about putting up banners at the African Burial Ground at 290 Broadway.
Keith Burns – Citizens Committee for NYC
Spoke about grants available for neighborhood improvement. Organizations can receive between
$500 and $3,000 and can also get program management help. Groups aren't required to have
501(c)3 status. The deadline is 1/31/2012 with extension to 2/7 but you must email your request
to grants@citizensNYC.org
Gary Spino – Resident
New urgent care facility opened on Liberty Street at Church Street. Massage and acupuncture are
also offered there and they are equipped with lab and x-ray facilities.
Winsome Brown – Church Street School
He is a Church St. School Board Member and spoke about honoring Paul Nagel at their
upcoming annual benefit. Paul was instrumental in the school’s growth. Students range from 16
months to 99 years old. The date of the event is 2/29/2012.
Elizabeth Chen – Southbridge resident
Objects to the proposed liquor store. She has 2 children under 5 and doesn’t want them to pass a
liquor store on their hway to school.
Andrew Berks – Resident of 45 Wall StreetSpoke about Police barricades and security measures around Wall Street. Doesn't believe there is
a good reason for this. Chase Plaza is also closed and he would like it to be reopened to the
public. Julie Menin responded that she had done a walk-through of the area with a Deputy
Mayor and CB1 would continue to advocate for the NYPD to relax security measures as much as
possible.
Yume Kitasei – Councilmember Chin's Representative
Hearing this Friday on the Danny Chen incident. The Council Member recently signed on to
Intros. 722 and 736. She supports looking how the three buildings proposed to be sold by the city
can be used to meet community and public needs.
Mary Cooley – State Senator Squadron's Representative
Happy Lunar New Year! The Senator wants this to be a holiday on the NYC school calendar. He
wrote letters about the sales of city buildings, he supports legislation against fingerprinting food
stamp recipients and he is working on campaign finance reform.
Jean Chen, Beth Goldstein & Toni Palmieri – Southbridge residents
All spoke against the proposed liquor store. They are focused on the social, not financial aspects
of these negotiations.
Emma Roszko – Assemblymember Glick's Representative
Spoke against NYU expansion on 2/11/2012
Paul Hovitz – CB#1 Member
Spoke about the petition against the Southbridge Liquor store. He believes the communication
from the SBT Board has been very poor.
Business Session
The minutes of the monthly meeting held on December 21, 2011 were adopted unanimously as
presented.
Chairperson’s Report
Spoke in favor of the Borough President’s position on the disposition of the three City-owned
buildings. The proposal will be presented to the Planning and Infrastructure Committee in
coming months. She was pleased to be appointed by the Mayor to the PAC Board. Work is
delayed at the Memorial Museum. This is troubling and we have a resolution tonight on the
subject. It was reported in the press that Silverstein Properties may only build 7 stories at 3 WTC
until there is more interest in commercial space there. Thanked Pat Moore for all her work on the
Holiday Party.District Manager’s Report
The budget reduction proposed for this mid-year will not take place but the next fiscal budget is
an issue.
He highlighted that the CB1 office is one of the three buildings involved in the proposed sale by
the city and that the CB1 staff met about a possible relocation of the CB1 office to the Municipal
Building. There are regular meetings at about film shoots with the Mayor's Office of Film,
Theater and Broadcasting and the staff always attends and can raise any concerns about this
activity in the district.
Treasurer’s Report
Discussed second quarter expenditures.

P. Hovitz, said there were some reported problems with religious institutions in schools.
M. Ameruso, when the ACLU came to the Tribeca committee they said equal access is required and has nothing
to do with the so called separation of church and state.
J. Fratta, schools are available to all faiths, none have been denied and separation of church and state exists so
there is no religion imposed by the state.
B. Townley, as far as I know, no group has been denied.
T. Goodkind, the Principal was against churches in schools in 2005.
A. Tannenbaum, noted that there are prayer spaces for Muslims at CUNY and this law has nothing to do with
the separation of church and state.

of work of the environmental study for the plan. Also, the Mayor and PD Commissioner want to

BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN COMMUNITY COLLEGE
199 CHAMBERS STREET, RICHARD HARRIS TERRACE
MAY 22, 2012
Public Session
Sarah Diaz – Assemblymember Glick's rep.
Concern about children waitlisted at local schools. There will be a public meeting about Hudson
River Park on May 31st at St. Paul's Chapel. A proposal to amend the legislation governing the
park will be discussed.
Congressman Nadler
He spoke about redistricting. His district has changed to include slightly more of Manhattan and
less of Brooklyn and still includes CB1. Mentioned a meeting with Rep. C. Maloney about
including cancers in the 9/11 Health Act. The threat of a debt ceiling, possibly after this year’s
election, is looming again and could be disastrous. Congressman Nadler indicated that he did not
like divided government and that one party should always be in charge. Also, that his budget is
too tight to have town hall meetings. The Congressman took questions from audience.
Robert Moore – Resident of Tribeca
Spoke about a petition protesting the burgeoning numbers of bars and restaurants in Tribeca
applying for liquor licenses. An increase in late night noise and other unwelcome behavior is
often the result. Asked CB1 to carefully vet these applications and asked the SLA to enforce the
500-Foot Rule and expressed the need for a better system than 311 for people to report problems.
Jennifer Rajkumar – District Leader
Launching an initiative to register votes called VOTE DOWNTOWN. Downtown for Change is
another organization to support the Obama Campaign. Supports the New Amsterdam Market’s
proposal for a permanent market in the New Market and Tin Buildings in the Seaport area.

space is available.

pedestrians around the school and supports this evening’s resolution about traffic controls.

of NY Public Library centralization initiative.
Melinda Konigsberg & Eileen McCrohan – 170 John Street Liquor License Application

that is in significant disrepair.
Amy Bergenfeld – Civil Service Bookshop at 38 Lispenard St.
They have been in the neighborhood for over 50 years. Spoke about missing street sign.
Mary Cooley – State Senator Squadron's rep
Thanks to Julie and CB#1 for supporting tenants at Independence Plaza North. The fight goes on
and is important to other tenants as well. Recently met about cuts to after-school programs and
the method used to decide which ones to cut. They wrote a letter supporting the proposal by the
New Amsterdam Market.
Tricia Joyce – CB#1
Heard today that DOE ordered PS 276 to add a fifth kindergarten class. This is contrary to what
the school overcrowding task force recommended. This will result in classes having 32 pupils.
Art and science classes will have to be closed to accommodate this change. People need to
organize to oppose this.
Andrew Horwitz – Director of Public Programs, Lower Manhattan Cultural CouncilThey are organizing the 2012 River-to-River Festival, which will begin on June 17th. He
described several of the events and locations. Check out rivertoriver.com

9/11. Last year’s event was intended to be a special 10th anniversary event but will consider what
could be done this year.
District Manager’s Report
Budget was restored at the beginning of the month (a little earlier than usual). The full budget for
community boards was base-lined for the next 2-3 years, which should help make cuts less likely
for those years. Went with other CB1 leaders to meet with EDC regarding helicopters using the
Downtown Heliport. Raised issues about adverse impacts to quality of life from this facility.
Also organized a meeting about impacts to Quality of Life in the area around the 911 Memorial.
Held an orientation for new CB1 members.Our graduating fellow, Diana, will remain with us through the summer finishing some projects.

Update on Hudson River Park’s Legislation Task Force
Not much more to add after Julie's report but the proposed changes under discussion, particularly
at Pier 40 (which has 1.7 million square feet) are significant. The possibly of residential housing
on Pier 40 has been raised. The Trust presented a compelling case for income-generation to
maintain quality parks. This would require an amendment to the legislation governing the Park.
There are many ideas for Pier 40 (major league soccer, schools, etc.) and while it is in CB#2,
such changes in use would have significant impacts on our community. These changes would
need to go through the State legislature and then ULURP.

 Jacques Capsouto (CB1): he is having problems with insurance for his business. Floods
are not covered by insurance. Response: the legislature might be able to help.

 Diane Lapson (CB1): 6 residents of IPN were told that copper-wired phones could not be

units.

It is expected to be open again in two weeks.
 Bob Townley (CB1): After 9/11 there was a grant program run by the federal government

years. It took 10 or 11 months to get the program established after 9/11.
 Tom Goodkind (CB1): The health of volunteers needs to be protected because they are
working in areas that are filled with toxins.

The minutes were adopted unanimously.
B) Chairperson’s Report – C. McVay Hughes
 Presented Lucy Acevedo with a gift from CB1.
 Thanked Evan Lacher, CB1 Community Liaison, for working remotely non-stop after
power was lost downtown. Sandy revealed that CB1 needs to be better prepared for
emergencies and be able to work remotely. CB1 had no power for the first week, and heat
only came on 11 days later -- and the phone service still does not function. In addition,
there were several government holidays.
 Surveyed damage at small businesses with BP Stringer and Downtown Alliance's Liz
Berger (10/31/12).
 Held CB1 Emergency Executive Meeting at Trinity Church; recalled April 2012
testimony before the NYC Committee on Environmental Protection on the need for NYC
to prepare for adverse climate change impacts on NYC’s critical infrastructure and
vulnerable citizens and the request for the Army Corp. of Engineers to expeditiously
conduct a study about the feasibility of installing storm surge barriers to protect NYC;
Council Member Chin and Assemblymember Glick came as well as representatives of

 Met with the new Battery Park City Authority (BPCA) leadership including Chair, Denis
Mehiel and Chief Operating Officer, Demetrios Boutris with Anthony Notaro and Jeff
Galloway. BPCA could not provide any time frame for when the Community Center or
the Ball fields will be opened, nor how delayed Pier A will be. They are still in the
assessment process. They followed the same communication strategy as with Hurricane
Irene. (11/15/12)
Discussion of the Civic Center Disposition Plan
 Michael Levine: the Civic Center Plan went through the full ULRP process. CB1
supported the consolidation of City Agencies, but opposed the disposition of the
buildings for private development. It was surprising to see that several City Council
Members objected to the sale of 22 Reade Street. The City Council rejected the sale of 22
Reade and would like to see an African-American Heritage Museum located there. The
Mayor vetoed the plan, but the City Council Overrode the veto. 22 Reade Street is out of
the Civic Center Plan.
 Matt V.: The City Council severed the application and excluded 22 Reade. They received
a call last night at 9pm informing them that a solution had been reached. The Council was
not given enough time to consider the proposed deal. Adam Malitz asked why the
severance of 22 Reade Street was not discussed at the Committee meeting.

storm. The middle and high school notifications were not clear. It was unclear which
schools were still being used as shelters while the children went back to school. Notify
NYC worked well to update people and it should be used by the DOE as well. FEMA had
still not responded to many families as of the committee meeting. Notifications need to
take into account that people have lost power and internet. Paul Hovitz wished everyone

Public Session:
Emma Roszko (Assembly Member Glick) Regarding tour bus situation since opening the 9/11
Memorial, is asking NYPD for more signage and enforcement for idling. DEC hydro-fracking hearing
comment period extended for 90 days -- keep in mind with all the flooding from the hurricane what
damage could have been caused.
John Ricker (NYC Comptroller's Office) Welcome back from summer break. Asked people to look at
website www.comptroller.nyc.gov to view financials for all elected officials and impact of Obama’s
jobs bill on NYC, also a report on economic trends before and after 9/11. Know of any waste or fraud
call their office, 212-669-3916.
Edgar Yu (LGBT coordinator for DA's office) this summer, internship program with 38 participants,
applications for 2012 will start in January. Hired 41 new ADA's. October is domestic violence
awareness month.
Mary Cooley (Sen. Squadron). Update on Marriage Equality Act took place August 16th. Updated
parent resource guide is available. Road curbside ponding is a problem.
Arthur Piccolo (Resident) Discussed Pier A. Claims that the BPCA came to CB#1 over 2 years ago
before they released the RFP. He claims they did not seek public input. The RFP got 7 applications.
They did not come to CB#1 to seek input about their decision and did not come back to CB1. The lease
is 25 years for a restaurant at $10 per square foot. Thirty million dollars worth of renovations with
public money at this point. Believes that the rent is well below market value. He requests that BPCA
come to CB#1 next board meeting.
John Fratta, filed a FOIL request to BPCA that was ignored. CB1 passed a resolution about the lack of
cooperation on the part of the BPCA and supported Arthur's position and request.
Marc Ameruso, we can ask Julie to send a letter.
Alec Schierenbeck (BP Stringer). Newly released report called “Arrested Development” covering allstalled construction sites, many are in CB1 and are a blight, affect safety and quality of life. Includes
ideas for temporary uses for vacant spaces.
T. J. Gilmartin ( 9/11 first responder). NYC owes first responders and residents a ticker tape parade to
say thank you. You all live down here. Other groups have been recognized.
John Fratta, It was shameful that first responders were not allowed at the 10th anniversary event.
Yume Kitasei (Councilmember Chin) as of two hours ago, the Chinatown BID was signed into law. M.
Chin will have a hearing next month on the continuing effects of 9/11 on small business. 10/6, 10 am
250 Broadway, 14 Floor hearing of Transportation Committee about inter-state bus issues in Lower
Manhattan
Paul Hovitz, would like to invite Councilmember Margret Chin to a breakfast on the new DOE zoning.
Susan Henshaw Jones (Director of Museum of City of New York) Jerry Gallagher has ceded to me his
time. Future of the Seaport museum. They are to sign an interim agreement for a maximum of 18
months to test the feasibility of management of the Seaport Museum. Jerry Gallagher will be the day to
day manager. In 1972, when the Seaport district was created, Susan was staff member of the Lower
Manhattan Development agency. She is aware of the intent and mission. The model of private business
supporting the Seaport Museum is broken. EDC is now landlord and in 2007 the City terminated the
license at Pier 15 and could no longer generate revenue for docking fees. She seeks support to return to
the original mission of the buildings and ships to tell the story of New York’s past. Wants CB#1
support. Expenses exceed income. The 1991 lease prohibits the Seaport from income-producing uses.
Need to lease space.
The current lease needs to be addressed. We will activate the space with school programs, exhibits, and
seaport-related activities that can take place on the 3rd to the 5th floor on Fulton Street as well as
reactivate the library. We welcome suggestions and need to let people know we are down there.
Andrew Berks (resident 45 Wall Street) Complaining about Police barricades set up on Wall Street
because of Occupy Wall Street protest. The sidewalks are extremely narrow for residents and tourists.
Believes it is overkill and concerned that this may be a permanent fixture. The stock exchange has also
set up barricades. Asked elected officials to help have the barricades removed.
Noah Pfefferblit, we have been in contact with NYPD and Mayor’s office on this issue.
Laurie Hanin (Director of Hearing & Communication Center) At 50 Broadway. Hearing loss is a
significant issue. Affects one out of six baby boomers and causes isolation. Services are provided on
Wednesdays 12 pm-2 pm and Thursday 4 pm-6 pm by appointment. Free screens are available, quick
tests.
Theodore Scull (South Street Seaport Museum) Member for 20 years. Watched seaport sadly spiral
downward. Spoke about enthusiasm for Susan's Leadership at the MCNY.
Michael Ketring (Board Member and Downtown Alliance) Spoke about Downtown Alliance Green
Around Lower Manhattan initiatives for the fall; Adopt a Geranium 10/12, 10 am to 12 pm., and Plant a
Bulb 10/22.Jennifer Jager (20 year resident of community) with Justin, Occupy Wall Street organizer. Pleased with
our decision to support Park 51 and now asks for CB1 to support Occupy Wall Street in Zuccotti Park.
Asks that CB1 ask Brookfield Properties to let them remain until protest is done. Thinks police
presence is overkill. Says protesters are peaceful.
Mike Kenny (District 37) Supports what T.J. Gilmartin asked about the first responder/resident ticker
tape parade. Mike is part of District 37 with 7000 members.
Marc Ameruso, public session will remain open for the Sukkah issue only, other than that the public
session is closed.

Speaker Silver arrived to address the community board
This Sunday from 4 – 5 pm for visit to WTC site. Thank you for contributing so much. BPC ballfields
are a success. The Spruce Street school opening was great for the kids and the families who chose
Lower Manhattan as their home.
Allen Tannenbaum, first responders were not allowed in the memorial on 9/11/11 even though there
was plenty of space. The report that there is no link from 9/11 and cancer is not true and the Mayor did
not support the first responders. Supports parade for first responders and residents.
John Fratta, aggress with Alan. First responders should be included in the total victims.
Marc Ameruso, Should remove the term ‘Ground Zero’ and replace it with ‘WTC site’. I was a first
responder, traveled down to D.C. with Alan, T.J., and Catherine to lobby for the Zadroga Bill.
Pat Moore, has a problem of who is going to pay for it.
T.J. Gilmartin, has an answer, foundations will pay for it. It will be paid for.

reconsider it…That’s not an easy job. You want to participate in the meeting but you have to be focused
on taking the notes.

13) Application for installation of Sukkah in Duane Park from October 12, 2011 to October 19, 2011
Julie Menin, application to put a Sukkah in Duane Park would conflict with fundraiser for Friends of
Duane Park and size of park was concern. BP Stringer asked Parks for approval. Many people in
community called. I found an alternative at vacant lot at 70 Warren Street, landlord agreed from 7 am to
7 pm with a bathroom at Church Street school, and insurance is covered. Overtime pay needed to keep
lot open over the weekend will be paid for by the Friends of Duane Park. So the application has been
withdrawn.
Alec from Stringer’s office, this was a good faith effort to resolve this. The BP was concerned that this
application was rejected because it was a religious observance. That would be discrimination. This is
not way the system in supposed to work: view applications neutrally. We would like to have a
discussion on how the board is to treat religious applications in the future.
Bruce Ehrmann, Understands conceptually the BP’s position. Another side is strict separation of church
and state.
Rabbi, we are very satisfied with the resolution. Thank everyone for your support and look forward to
the celebration.
Carrie, Friends of Duane Park, A lot of people worked on this and thank you for everyone’s help.
Thank you Julie.
Peter Braus, this is a fine example of the CB at its best.
Marc Ameruso, the public session is officially closed.

Ro Sheffe, need to balance free speech with the quality of life.
They have no permit or right to sleep in the park, they moved in beds, it’s like a dorm.
Every day hundreds of people beat drums and chant, we do not deserve this.
We did not cause the global financial collapse.
Julie Menin, my concern is we did not take this to committee with a major resolution, we need to hear
it at a committee.
Paul Hovitz, move to table. John Fratta, second
Motion to table; 23 -14 in favor to table.
Julie Menin, we need to work with the Mayor’s office and get the resident complaints addressed with a

Yume Kitasei – Councilmember Chin
Sent letter to CEC regarding school rezoning. DOT will install a traffic signal at Duane and Greenwich. Pre-K
registration is still open. Working on Occupy Wall Street (OWS), which involves first amendment issues and
quality of life concerns.
Alan Schulkin – Resident. Says that noise from OWS protests is impacting the area.
John Scott – Can’t allow a few problems to stop OWS, supports protests.
Ilene Kahn – Tribeca for Change and Teacher. Supports OWS because injustices in society need to be
addressed. Says the noise will take care of itself.
Ashley Love – OWS Drummer. OWS passed resolution to drum 12: to 2: and 4: to 6: The drumming is
spiritual.
Gordon Crovitz – Resident. Says CB1 has failed to represent the community. Brookfield tried to enforce the
rules of the park but the local elected leaders threatened them. There are time, place and manner restrictions to
free speech.
Douglas Levison – Flower Power. Thanked CB1 and hopes to build bridges with events.
James Fernandez – Resident. Supports free speech but not OWS. Says it has gotten out of hand with urine and
defecation in streets. OWS has perverted the first amendment and is infringing upon the rights of residents.
Robert Moore – Resident. Opposed the resolution supporting a sidewalk café at 109 West Broadway due to
noise and the windows being left open.
Jason O’Brien – Business at 115 Broadway. OWS has negatively affected his business, sales are down 30%.
There has been graffiti in the bathroom that cost $2300 to repair. His staff wants security and area businesses
have been a sacrificial lamb to OWS.
Marc Scherzer – OWS. Says they will continue to work on the problems. There was no drumming yesterday
after 6:45pm.
Sarah Landreth – Seaport Museum. Thanked Museum of the City of New York and CB1 for their support in the
FY 2013 capital and expense budget and stated that the museum will be coming back.
Alan Ellis – Brooklyn resident. Calls on everyone to address the problems caused by OWS, including people
from all generations.Brian Copp – Resident. Says the CB1 resolution is shocking and misguided. OWS is having a detrimental

community forums.
Paul Newell – Resident and District Leader. Supports OWS and the CB resolution and is focused on economic
equality.
Linda Gerstman – Resident. CB1 is supposed to be concerned with the community. The OWS people do not
live in the neighborhood. It is inappropriate for them to have tents and generators in the park. Elected officials
will be judged at election time.
Mark – Resident. There is noise from Sazon Linda restaurant from the sidewalk café up until 2 and 3 am.
Paul Beban – 55 Liberty Street. We have lost a valuable public space as a result of OWS.

Mary Habstritt – Lilac. Exhibit at Pier 25 will be closing soon. Spoke about the mariner’s response on 9/11.
Susan Jennings – OWS member. Resident. Supports OWS as a parent. Took her daughter to OWS and says
civil disobedience is part of American history. This is important.
Chris Cobb – OWS member. Brooklyn resident. Has been at OWS everyday. It is okay for the Tea Party to
bring guns to rallies. Says he has contacts with other OWS groups.
John Ricker – NYC Comptroller Liu. Visit the Comptroller’s website to see information regarding city audits
and expenses.
Frances Mercanti-Anthony – OWS member. The OWS library is free of cost and a great amenity. Thanked
CB1 for its support.

issues.

here for change. We want to be free.
Joel Kupferman – National Lawyers Guild. Says after 9/11, we proved the air was bad and the EPA did not
want to hear it. With OWS there are two competing issues: the right to assembly and the right of the community
to have a safe and pleasant environment.
Nicole Carty – OWS member. Tried hard to work with the neighborhood. The current economic situation is
not right. The best thing for the world is to let OWS to continue.
Adash Daniel – OWS member. Quit his job to come to support OWS and is sleeping in the park. Says OWS is
now part of the community.
Famil McManis – Resident. Supports OWS because of income inequality. Says he had to fight with the police

MANHATTAN COMMUNITY BOARD #1
DANCE NEW AMSTERDAM
NOVEMBER 22, 12011
Public Session
Paul Goldstein – Representative from the Office of Speaker Sheldon Silver
Peck Slip is our next new school to be built. DOE Chancellor Walcott agreed to our request to
enlarge the school from approximately 70,000 to 90,000 square feet. We are still going through
the school re-zoning process. The DOE seems to want to address overcrowding by transferring
children to other schools outside their neighborhood. The Speaker is on record opposing
this. The Spruce St. School that opened in September has new traffic lights and guards. Also, the
Speaker is in support of the “Millionaire’s Tax”.
Matt Viggiano – Representative from the Office of Council Member Margaret Chin
CM Chin introduced two bills, one of which restricts large truck trailers from being parked in
front of residential buildings.
Alec Schierenbeck – Representative from the Office of Manhattan Borough President Scott
Stringer
CB members should submit re-applications and encourage others to apply. BP Stringer
announced the “green your block” program and encouraged applications. BP Stringer invites the
Board to the CB Members reception at the Met Museum on 11/28/2011.
Emma Roszko – Representative from the office of Assembly Member Deborah Glick
Assemblywoman Glick is asking about state money for Excellence Funds to decrease class sizes.
Very interested in the outcome of state review of hydrofracking; there will be a DEC hearing on
November 30th at BMCC from 1 to 4pm and 6 to 9pm.
Shino Tanikawa - CEC District 2.

Neither option is perfect nor is it very difficult to choose between them. Crossings of local streetsshould be made safer so that they are not an issue. The Department of Transportation should
repair the elevators at pedestrian bridges!
9/11 TRIAL LOCATION. Said that there are many reasons why the trials should not be held
downtown. Thanked everyone who has worked so diligently against this proposal. She has
spoken to the Mayor regarding Governors Island as a possible location and to many individuals,
none of whom have suggested that we hold the trials in Lower Manhattan. While the trials must
be held in the Southern District of Manhattan, a military installation within this jurisdiction could
be used.
A number of CB1 members spoke in support of the resolution calling for the 9/11 trials to be
relocated: John Fratta, Paul Hovitz, Tom Goodkind, Diane Lapson, Bob Townley, Marc
Ameruso, Mark Costello, Allen Tannenbaum, Linda Belfer, and Mariama James. Allen
Tannenbaum additionally argued against having the trials on Governors Island, since the
security required could be as costly and dangerous as having it downtown.

Business Session
Adoption of Minutes
The minutes of the monthly meeting held on January 26, 2010 were adopted as presented.
Chairperson’s Report J. Menin
9/11 TRIAL LOCATION. Chairperson Julie Menin has worked hard to get a definitive
confirmation that the 9/11 trials will not be held in Lower Manhattan. Attorney
General Eric Holder has failed to respond to our letter requesting a feasibility study
for various alternate sites that we proposed. She will write another letter to Eric
Holder reiterating our request. She also does not believe that City Council legislation
in favor of relocating the trial should include a contingency clause requesting that the
federal government pay for the security costs associated with the trial should it be
held downtown.
Several CB1 members discussed whether the 9/11 trial ought to be held in a military
tribunal or civilian setting. The discussion was inconclusive.
INTERNAL ELECTIONS. Announced that the nominating process will begin in March,
and all CB1 members are eligible to serve on the Nominating Committee. The
Committee consists of five members and if more than five people are nominated there
will be an election for committee membership.
Summarized the discussions at a recent Executive Committee meeting regarding the
future of LMDC and the battle between Larry Silverstein and the Port Authority over
financial issues associated with the WTC redevelopment.

already selected the Chair, CUNY Chancellor Matthew Goldstein. Community Board
1 should request a revision of the ULURP process to enhance community review andmake it more meaningful. The Planning and Infrastructure Committee will oversee
this effort for CB1 and all interested board members should attend.

input into planning issues by boards could be eliminated.

Liaison
Reported on a meeting they and Marc Ameruso attended at the Office of the
Manhattan Borough President’s Office with the State Liquor Authority.
The SLA discussed five major ideas which will happen within 18 months:
1) An initiative to allow for electronic submission of resolutions by community
boards;
2) Publishing applications online;
3) Introduction of a Downstate Enforcement Office to serve the 5 boroughs;
4) Standardization of language for negative resolutions so that they are more clear;
and
5) Reforming the renewals process (currently, we only have 30 days to make
recommendations on applications for license renewals, and they are approved
unless there’s been criminal activity).
The State Legislature Authority is currently working on a package of legislative
reforms, which will allow them to improve their rules and regulations.
Marc Ameruso further added that the SLA has confirmed that a liquor license is a
privilege not a right.

2. Continuation of Loft Laws – Resolution
The Loft Law is scheduled to expire soon. May, 2010. Many of the lofts in Tribeca
were settled over the past 2 decades, allowing people to stay in their homes while
landlords upgraded their lofts to make them habitable. There are about 71 buildings
in our district with interim status that have not been converted. We are running out
of time though to ensure that these tenants have the same protection as rent stabilized
tenants. Those not protected by the loft law may therefore lose their homes.

provide an opportunity to add more actual BPC voices to this important deliberative body –
Resolution
Two people have left the Board of the BPC Authority, so there are two seats currently
available. William C. Thompson has been appointed as the new President. There is a
resident of Lower Manhattan already on the Board, but he’s not a CB1 Member and not
known to any CB1 members. Members have a fiduciary duty to the BPC Authority, and the
Authority claims there could be a conflict of interest if a CB1 member were to join the board.
Bob Townley disagrees with this as do Mark Costello and Bill Love.

can contact this center if they have complaints about city services.
CITY AUDITS. Announced a new website that enables the public to review city audits at:
www.comptroller.nyc.gov/mymoneynyc/index.asp
 Molly Bidol – Representative from the Office of Assembly Member Deborah Glick
SCHOOL OVERCROWDING. The AM wrote a letter to the Department of Education asking for
parental choice for all parents with waitlisted children in lower Manhattan district schools.
AFTER-SCHOOL FUNDING CUTS. The AM wrote a letter to the DYCD urging reconsideration
of funding for Manhattan Youth’s P.S./I.S. 89 afterschool program.

Board 1 Chairperson, Julie Menin, participated on the panel and turnout was very good. The
AM plans to continue working with the arts and business communities to build partnerships.
CHARTER REVISION. The AM wrote a letter to Matthew Goldstein, Chair of the Charter
Revision Commission, asking for the Charter Revision process to be more transparent and
open to input from the public.

work for alternative health care options.
 David Gmach – Director of New York City Public Affairs, Con Edison
Spoke in regard to a resolution on the agenda calling for LMDC to use remaining funds
allocated for utilities to build a Performing Arts Center at the WTC site. Stated that these
funds are meant to cover outstanding costs to Con Ed arising from emergency restoration of
services after 9/11. While he believes that a performing arts center is a worthy project for the
WTC site, argued that it should not be funded with money owed to Con Ed. If this were to
happen, Con Ed would have to raise rates for their customers. Congress passed legislation to
ensure utility customers would get reimbursed, and Con Ed would like to continue to work
with the LMDC on these reimbursements. This reimbursement process is one that hasn’t
been concluded.Julie Menin – Chairperson, Community Board 1
Responded to disagree with David Gmach. Stated that millions of dollars have already been
paid to Con Ed, and advocated that the remaining utility money be used to create immediate
construction jobs. Objects to the idea that there might need to be a rate increase, when Con
Ed has already received tens of millions of dollars in reimbursements.
David Gmach
Responded that there is a process underway and all costs have not yet been covered.
Julie Menin
State that she would be willing to meet with Mr. Gmach to discuss this issue further.

Bus Service (SBS). The meeting is on Thursday, April 29, 2010 and will discuss the possible
implications for parking, commercial unloading and loading. Based on what he knows of the
planned service, he doesn’t believe there will be a lot of issues involving Lower Manhattan,
since there are very few changes planned for the downtown segment of the service. However,
he encourages people to attend if they are interested.

GRAND STREET FIRE. The CM has been working to help residents and businesses that were

conference on the issue, and has worked with Senator Squadron’s Office on this situation.

There is money in the capital budget to create a new school downtown, so people with ideas
for sites should send them to Paul Goldstein.
LOFT LAW. Announced renewal and enhancement of the Loft Law.
GREEN MARKETS. The AS supports the idea of a regional food market at the site of the old

Chairperson’s Report J. Menin
APPOINTMENT OF NEW MEMBERS. Welcomed new CB1 members: Nadine Bosson, George
Calderaro, Marva Craig, Jeff Ehrlich, and Tricia Joyce. There will be an orientation for new
members at the Community Board Office on May 3rd, and current members are welcome to
attend as well. Thanked departing members, John Foss and Antonina Simeti.
CHARTER REVISION. The Community Board 1 Planning Committee recently focused on the idea
that ULURP is neither uniform nor consistent, and has produced uneven results. Attended the
Brooklyn Charter Commission hearing and waited 4 hours to testify. Saw the long wait as a good
sign that people are concerned. Community Board 1 is organizing a conference with the
Municipal Arts Society on land use and Charter reform to be held at Pace University on July 21.
COMMUNITY BOARD 1 BUDGET CUTS. Drastic cuts have been proposed for Community Board
budgets. There will be a rally at City Hall on the budget cuts.
 Bob Townley
Community Board 1 members should try to attend the rally, since the rally will be in our
community downtown.
LOWER MANHATTAN DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION. Has been a vocal critic of the LMDC for
many years and argued that it should be shut down at a certain point. Asked David Emil to
present a final accounting of leftover funds to the Board, and discovered that there are millions
of dollars remaining. Spoke in favor of reallocating utility funds to build the Performing Arts
Center (PAC) at the WTC site. The current master plan calls for the PAC to be on Site 1b, but if
it goes there, construction won’t start until 2017. Starting so late is unacceptable. Instead, the
PAC could be built on the Tower 5 Site (Deutsche Bank), using the LMDC utility money to start
construction immediately. An LMDC feasibility study also indicates it would be much cheaper to
build on Tower 5 than Site 1b. Wrote an OpEd on this in the Daily News recently. Has also
recommended that NYU build on top of the PAC at Site 1B instead of expanding in the Village.FDNY FIRE HOUSE CLOSURES. Engine 4 in the Seaport is slated to be closed. Met with a
representative from the Fire Department to discuss the possible closure of the Fire House and
other FDNY issues.
 Paul Hovitz
Proposed a resolution regarding Community Board 1 opposition to the closure of Engine 4,
particularly given that Community Board 1 fire houses must also cover fires on Governor’s
Island as a result of the elimination last year of the fire station there.
SCHOOL OVERCROWDING. Speaker Silver’s recent overcrowding task force meeting was
productive.
SEAPORT FOOD MARKET. Recently attended Speaker Quinn’s press conference proposing a
regional food market at the site of the Fulton Fish Market. General Growth might provide the
space, but details would need to be spelled out and understood.
PEDESTRIAN SAFETY. DOT has no meritorious reason to oppose a stop sign on Duane Street.
Arts Downtown. Recently participated in Assembly Member Glick’s Forum on Arts downtown.
The Ohio Theatre is slated to close. This underscores the need to increase and bolster cultural
facilities downtown.
COMMEMORATION OF ALBERT CAPSOUTO. Spoke with the Parks Department about a proper
commemoration for Albert Capsouto. Manhattan Parks Commissioner Castro assured her that
they would seriously consider renaming CaVaLa park for Albert Capsouto as was requested.

APPOINTMENT OF NEW MEMBERS. Welcomed the five new members.

Battery Park City Committee L. Belfer
1. Discussion regarding traffic safety issues on Murray Street and North End Avenue – Report
For many years, the segment of Murray Street between North End Avenue and River Terrace
has been closed. Recently, this part of the street was open. Due to ongoing construction
along North End Avenue, the opening of this street, the upcoming opening of Tear Drop Park
South across the street from Tear Drop Park (already open), and the lack of signage or
lights, the intersection of North End Avenue and Murray Street is extremely dangerous for
traffic and pedestrians. Community Board 1 has requested a walk-through of the area with

due to lack of space for some other grades.
 Jeff Galloway

middle schoolers being able to attend schools in the district, it is more important for
kindergartners to be able to go to a school close to home.

Changes to City Charter Section 197 City Uniform Land Use Review Process – Report
There will be a Charter Revision Commission that may propose changes that would
affect our current procedures. However, as a community board, we should consider
making suggestions ahead of the Commission's recommendations. We need to be very
focused on this as it is an important process that will extend over a number of years. The
committee needs volunteers to work on this project.
Charter Revision Task Force – Report
We need to maintain vigilance in participating in the planning of our neighborhoods. We
don’t want to reduce our role in city planning, we want to increase it.
Battery Park City Committee – L. Belfer
Presentation of Milstein safety plan for the 200 and 300 North End Avenue project –
Report
The community objects to state DOT’s plan for tearing up the park and the dog run for 18
months, just to rebuild it. Our task force proposes minimal alterations. The park project
began with the former Governor and is associated with changes to be made to the
promenade. State DOT is working with us. Next Wednesday, DOT will meet with us
again. The funding exists for this project, but if we don’t use it we’ll lose the money
because the funds cannot be transferred to another project.
Discussion about traffic problems at W. Thames and Battery Place – Report
Although Battery Place ends at W. Thames the traffic doesn’t stop there. Drivers do not
obey the stop sign at this intersection. The “safety barriers” at West St. and Joseph P.
Ward St. are not functioning as safety barriers in-as-much-as the drivers ignore them.
Conn MacAogain of NCYDOT listened to concerns and will take them back to DOT for
analysis and possible solutions.
Discussion about bridge jurisdiction and security issues at the World Financial Center –
Report
The oftentimes inoperable elevators on the Vesey Street pedestrian bridge are an
6inconvenience and a nuisance and there is often inadequate signage advising the
community of the broken elevator. The Committee is also concerned about the ability of
wheelchair-bound people to exit from the World Financial Center in an emergency
situation. There needs to be better planning for emergency situations.
A representative from the Milstein development company met with the committee
recently. The ball field adjacent to the building under construction by Milstein is still a
major concern. Precautions must be taken for windy conditions.

No Speakers
To view document go to http://www.nyc.gov/html/omb/html/home/home.shtml
Public Session:
Marc Halverson, Community Education Council
 Community Education Councils are a vehicle for parents to communicate directly to
schools.
John Ricker, New York City Comptroller’s Office
 Testified at the MTA hearings, proposing alternatives to service cuts and fare hikes, such
as a weight-based registration system and reinstatement of the commuter tax.
 New York City has an extremely high ratio of dept obligation.
Maria Mancini, Resident
 Spoke against renewal of liquor license for Eros/Peppers/Deco club.
Paul Goldstein, Office of New York State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver
 Is working on securing funding for Fulton Street Transit Center from the federal stimulus
bill––$500 million for the full station to be completed.
 New classrooms will be opening for the 2009-10 school year at the Tweed Courthouse.
There will be three follow-up informational sessions. Paul Hovitz, CB 1 Member,
commented that we need the Speaker to help identify the catchment areas for these
schools.
 225 Rector Street is in foreclosure; the Speaker has stepped in and a receiver will be
designated.
 Deutsche Bank/130 Liberty Street building public meeting is next Thursday at 5:30 PM

Eric Rayner
Andrew Frereich
Greg Kirschenbaum, Liaison--Manhattan Borough President’s Office.
 The MBP and Catherine McVay Hughes as Chairperson of Borough Construction Watch
sent a letter to LMDC about the most recent 130 Liberty Street building incident and the
need for better community outreach.
 MBPO released a report on food policy and access to city markets for farmers.
 MBP Stringer gave the State of the Borough address February 19th.
Suellen Epstein

Diane Stein – Councilmember Alan Gerson’s Office
 Announced a Council Hearing on the status of Governor’s Island that will address budget
issues and summer programs to be held on the island.
Jeremy Bates, President of Congregation, Trinity Church
 NYC Department of Homeless Services did not renew contract with the Congregation of
Trinity Wall Street to provide drop-in center services for homeless people at John Heuss
House, a city-owned space at 42 Beaver Street. The facility will not have enough time to
find a new location. Closing John Heuss House will force many homeless persons out
onto the streets of Lower Manhattan. CB#1 has for many years supported John Heuss
House. Mr. Bates asked CB to support a request to DHS to extend the current contract at
42 Beaver Street for at least one more year so that the facility will have more time to find
a new location.
Mary Cooley, Office of State Senator Daniel Squadron

The minutes of the monthly meeting held on January 27, 2009 were adopted as presented.
2Chairperson’s Report:
Julie Menin reported on the following issues:
 Update on the LMDC grants for Lower Manhattan schools.
 130 Liberty Street: demolition will take about six months.
 We received the final installment of the grant from Friends of Lower Manhattan.
 Board member attendance: Committee attendance has been low, and the MBP has
reiterated that attendance is a key factor in reappointments. Since attendance on only two
committees is mandatory, please step down from any third committee you are on if it
adversely affects your attendance.
District Manager’s Report:
Noah Pfefferblit reported on the following issues:
 Reminded committee chairs to submit needed material for Annual Report in time to meet
the approaching deadline.
 Addressed the crisis facing John Heuss House. The City has told the facility that changes
are being made in the way homeless facilities are operated and its contract with the City
and its space may be in jeopardy. The Downtown Alliance contributes funds to JHH and
is putting together a meeting with the Department of Homeless Services. CB1, a long-
time supporter of JHH, has offered to help.
 CB1 got a copy of a letter sent to Rep. Nadler's Office from the US Postal Service stating
that there are no current plans to sell the Peck Slip post office and it is not being actively
marketed.
 CB1 is developing a newsletter and is working out formatting issues so that the first issue
can be sent out.
 Introduced Michael Levine and Kasey LaFlam to discuss a project they are working on
with Tom Goodkind to create a database of affordable housing units in CB1.

Street Fairs Task Force B. Love
Discussions are underway with Joe Giovanni of Mardi Gras Festival Productions about financial
arrangements and locations for possible parks fairs to be sponsored by CB1 in 2009. Depending
on the outcome, a holiday fair could also be considered for late 2009
Parks fairs would not involve street closures and could help supplement fundraising from regular
street fairs. Bill Love and Noah Pfefferblit held a follow-up meeting with two representatives of
the City Parks Department to identify the most promising locations for such park fairs from
3among those discussed by the Task Force. The three priority locations that will be further
analyzed for their revenue potential are:
Thomas Paine Park (Foley Square); Battery Place – the sidewalk area along the northern
perimeter of Battery Park from approximately Washington Street on the west almost to State
Street (across from Citibank) on the east; and Park Row Plaza – sidewalk area east of City Hall
Park and just south of Chambers Street.
Financial arrangements would involve sales revenues split among CB1, the Parks Department
and Mardi Gras Festival Productions. Pending further investigation, there can be no guarantee
that any of these locations will work out financially. Any recommendations by the Task Force
proposing sponsorship of one or more such park fairs to raise additional funds for CB1 will be
brought before the appropriate CB1 geographic committees for review.

Governors Island, SLA application for liquor license for Great Performances Artists as
Waitresses Inc/New York Water Taxi - Resolution
BOARD VOTE: 39 In Favor 0 Opposed 0 Abstained 0 Recused
Performance Artists as Waitresses Inc./New York Water Taxi – Resolution. The committee has
some concerns about safety. However, the operator has a great track record and this could help
put Governor’s Island back on track. The idea of jazz, recreation and added ferry service to the
island appealed to the committee. GIPEC and the appropriate government authorities will be
responsible for safety concerns.
Hudson River Park Trust Update – Report
Hudson River Park Trust Update, Connie Fishman. Presented the plans for Piers 25 and 26. Pier
25 is fully funded, but Pier 26 is not. The committee is asking for Pier 26 to be fully funded and
for the return of the community groups and community amenities that were displaced when
reconstruction of those piers began 3 years ago.
Discussion of Committee Goals and Accomplishments for 2008 Annual Report. The committee
reviewed last year’s accomplishments and agreed to goals for the coming year for CB1’s Annual
report.
Bob Townley drafted a letter to NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly about dangers to
pedestrians crossing West Street created by drivers who violate speed limits and possibly drive
while intoxicated. There appears to be very little enforcement of traffic regulations on this street
and thus law enforcement personnel need to be more diligent in enforcing traffic violations by
drivers. The problems are more serious at night than in the daytime. Julie Menin addressed a
previous threat to safety on West Street by directly calling the governor. It was agreed that the
letter would be sent to elected officials to ask them to show leadership on this issue.
4Need a representative for the working group for Pier 57 in CB4. We need to have someone
attend these meetings and review the numerous proposals. There is more information on the
Hudson River Park Trust website. Speak with Michael Levine if you’re interested in joining this
very important group.
Bicyclists and pedestrians also need to be diligent when crossing Route 9A! It’s not a typical
street.

Infrastructure Committee J. Galloway
Columbia University Planning Studio – Report
Columbia graduate school faculty and graduate students met with the committee, which shared
concerns about Greenwich South and discussed objectives we’d like to see come out of this
study. With the downswing in the economy, we should have sufficient time to discuss potential
future development in this area. However, we should plan ahead for when the economy
recovers. The Columbia group will continue to meet with the committee and present its
proposals in May.
48-52 Franklin Street 421-a Tax Abatement Application – Report
This is an as-of-right issue that the committee chose not to comment on. The committee noted
that this project does not include affordable housing available.
City Land Use Review Process – Report
6Developers’ need, but pay special attention to, and not overlook, issues of infrastructure when
making decisions development. We, as a community group, plan to be more proactive in
monitoring infrastructure. There is an instance in Staten Island zoning in which there is a
payback from developers, e.g. schools, to balance new development projects.
New York City Charter Revision – Report
There are rumors that the Mayor wishes to eliminate community boards. The rumors may be
partly due to his interest in streamlining the ULURP process. We, the communities, will be the
ones to suffer if we’re not a part of the ULURP process and are not in a position to negotiate
with developers for economic give-backs in the areas where they are planning to develop. We
will try to make constructive suggestions. Anyone interested in joining this group is welcome.

The West Thames working group, NYS DOT and the Battery Park City Authority – Report
Committee member and working group chair Jeff Galloway described various design proposal
options for the park: a) approve the proposal; b) approve the design and ask for a promenade
modification; or c) oppose the park redesign proposal period. He noted the difficulties of
designating a location for a landing in the park if and when a new bridge replaces the Rector
Street Bridge. The limited space available for the park––which has been carefully planned with
community input––would be even more constrained with such a bridge landing in the north end
7of the park, where the community gardens and the basketball courts are slated to be. Neither
NYCDOT nor Parks can yet say when the bridge might be built.

Quality of Life Committee P. Moore
Practice of ticketing residents in District #1 for loading and unloading cars in No Standing or No
Loading zones – Report
Two residents of the Financial District complained to DOT representatives at the committee
meeting that signage was creating problems for residents loading and unloading cars in front of
their residences. Giving several examples of ticketing incidents that both they and others have
experienced, they suggested that the signage is inconsistent with the reality on the ground. DOT
representative Suchi Sanagavarapu responded that DOT intends to change the signs after current
construction is complete. Committee Chair Pat Moore suggested that in the meantime DOT
provide disclaimer letters upon request to ticketed residents and, given the problems with the
signage, encourage traffic enforcement to allow for exceptions to normal enforcement of rules to
allow them to discharge passengers, etc. within a 10-min. period. She also suggested that
posting rules and regulations on the agency website might clarify the regulations. Sam Schwartz,
former DOT Commissioner and now consultant and newspaper columnist, was suggested as a
possible contact person for these complaints.

 D.O.T.’s plan to move commuter buses from the FDR Drive to West Street between

 Discussed the impasse between the Port Authority and Larry Silverstein that is impeding

 Bankruptcy of GGP was not a big surprise, but CB1 rightly took this possibility into
consideration when voting on whether to recommend approval of the plan. Thanks to
John Fratta and his team for due diligence while working on this issue. The community
center issue can be brought up again once GGP, or whoever assumes control of the
property, comes back to the board and is ready to move forward.
District Manager’s Report:
Noah Pfefferblit reported on the following issues:
 Community Board budget proposal remains very dire. Noah has been involved in
ongoing budget discussions with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the
Manhattan Borough President’s Office and other agencies to develop viable means by
which to reduce our personnel budget – by covering some of the current personnel costs
with privately raised funds. Ideally, Noah plans to have all of the necessary information
very soon to present the Board with a proposal for consideration.
 Noah and Michael Levine met with the Lower Manhattan Transportation Commissioner
Luis Sanchez and local elected officials to discuss alternative locations for the commuter
buses that are being displaced from the FDR Drive by construction. Commissioner
Sanchez agreed to meet with the respective committee chairs who would be most familiar
with suggested locations.
 Noah, Michael Levine, Judy Norinsky, Ro Sheffe and Peter Braus attended various

for the State Liquor Authority (SLA), answered questions, clarified procedures and

hurricane flood zones for the 5 boroughs. She highlighted the possible effects of continued
rising water levels due to global warming. For information on measures the city is taking, a
representative from the Mayor’s Office of Emergency Management will speak at our next
meeting. All are welcome.
Proposed Gas Drilling Near Upstate Reservoirs – Report
The proposed natural gas drilling, close to the Catskill/Delaware watershed, which supplies most
of New York City’s water, poses great risk to the water supply of New York City and the health
of all who drink the water. The hydraulic fracturing process pumps millions of gallons of water
7and chemicals into the ground. CB 2 has already passed a resolution calling on the State to
prohibit hydraulic fracturing. We expect to have a resolution to present to the Board in May.
The Department of City Planning Grocery Study – Report
City Planning has concluded that according to the department’s criteria, Community District One
has enough supermarkets and does not need any more.
City Land Use Review Process – Report
Extensive research has revealed numerous cities in which money gained from agreements on
development proposals went into the cities’ general fund and not back into the communities.
The committee is continuing its research to identify a precedent whereby money gained from a
ULURP must be reinvested in an affected community.
Kasey LaFlam, our outgoing Urban Fellow, has outlined a proposal for her successor to conduct
a community facilities study that would examine existing community infrastructure and cross
compare it with what we feel would meet expected demands on our population. We need to be
proactive because otherwise city agencies determine our needs based more on an archaic cookie-
cutter method rather than by consulting the community in a more meaningful way.
Battery Park City Committee
Goldman Sachs and the Future of the Vesey Street Pedestrian Bridge – Report
Discussions continue regarding the West Street crossings. The Goldman Sachs Memorandum of
Understanding called for the Vesey Street bridge to come down by the end of March 2009, upon
completion of construction projects in the vicinity. Construction delays have prevented this from
occurring, and Goldman would like to speed up overall construction in the area so that the bridge
can come down. The Vesey Street Bridge will enable safe West Street crossings until
completion of the promenade, now projected to be completed in 2014.

Business Session:
The minutes of the monthly meeting held on April 28th, 2009 were adopted as presented.
District Manager’s Report:
Noah Pfefferblit noted that the Chairperson was unable to attend the meeting that night, so he would cover
her report as well as his own.
- Commended Bob Townley for supportive comments he made about community boards and reported
about Manhattan Borough President Stringer’s event in association with the four other Borough
Presidents, planned for June 10 on the steps of City Hall, to protest the proposed cuts. Noted that the
office would send an email encouraging everyone to attend and stressed the importance of a strong
showing from CB1, as the proposed cut was completely unreasonable. While CB1 would fight the
proposed cuts as vigorously as possible, planning was needed in the event that they are carried out.
Noted that Roger Byrom would discuss later in this meeting contingency plans that CB1 was drawing up.
- We received extremely positive news from the Department of Transportation about the displacement of
buses from the East River esplanade. The Academy buses – which make up the better part of the buses
involved – were moved to facilities that Academy already operates in midtown and New Jersey.
Academy agreed to try this on an interim basis and it is hoped that it will become a long-term solution.
This was a great victory for CB1 since we defeated a plan that was clearly inappropriate and our
intervention produced a much better result. Commissioner Sanchez agreed to our request that he
regularly update appropriate CB1 leaders on this matter. An additional group of buses will be displaced
when work starts farther north on the FDR Drive and we hope to work closely with DOT on these buses
as well.
- Thanked the CB1 members who agreed to mentor our new members. All of the new members attended
the CB1 orientation and the mentors agreed to contact them shortly thereafter.
- Commended Kasey LaFlam, the outgoing CB1 Urban Planning Fellow, provided by a program
administered by the Manhattan Borough President's Office, for her excellent work at CB1. Also thanked
the two high school students provided by the Municipal Art Society who presented graphics at recent
CB1 meetings to illustrate issues being discussed.
- Introduced Michael Levine to report about the Chinatown Working Group. Mr. Levine said a town hall
meeting will be held on June 1, 2009 and invited all interested to attend.

MANHATTAN COMMUNITY BOARD # 1
HELD
JUNE 30, 2009
SOUTHBRIDGE TOWERS
90 BEEKMAN STREET
COMMUNITY ROOM
Julie Menin, Chairperson, called the meeting to order.
Public Session:
Diane Stein – (Council Member Alan Gerson’s Office) reported that proposed cuts to Fire
Department service in Lower Manhattan were restored in the fiscal year 2010 budget adopted by
the Mayor and City Council. Library funds have also been made available. NY Downtown
Hospital will be able to purchase equipment to improve cardiovascular services and grab bars are
being provided free of charge.
Thomas Chase – Objects to the application for a newsstand at Liberty and Nassau Streets, based
upon its location in front of a commercial building he represents.
Alan Tannenbaum – Book of Alan’s photographs about NY in the 70’s is back in print. Photos
are on exhibit at the “Not Fade Away” art gallery.
Jim Cullen – Requests that a street be named after Frank Durkan, who worked as an attorney in
this community for more than 50 years.
John Ricker – (NYC Comptroller William C. Thompson’s Office) ClearView on the
Comptroller’s website allows you to retrieve information regarding contracts that have been
registered in NYC. For additional information regarding education and the lack of parental
input, go to www.comptroller@nyc.gov.
Jim Watson – B.P.C. resident shared his major concerns regarding the West Thames Street
Bridge: the loss of trees and the chaotic intersection.
Molly Hyojung Bidol – (Assemblywoman Deborah J. Glick’s Office) reported the Assembly
Member’s disappointment over the adoption, by the Hudson River Park Trust Board of
Directors, of an extension of the Pier 40 lease from 30 to 49 years. She’s concerned that DOT is
seemingly inconsiderate of seniors, by rerouting the M7 bus southbound down Seventh Avenue
while sections of Broadway will be closed to traffic at Times Square and Herald Square.
Assembly Member Glick continues to communicate with the NYPD as well as the State Liquor
Authority (SLA) regarding liquor license renewals. She voted “No” on Mayoral Control
although the Assembly passed legislation renewing it. Pointed out that this year, for the first
time in the history of the Rent Guidelines Board (RGB), the RGB’s yearly price study showed
that costs to landlords have not risen significantly. Owners have benefited from past rent hikes
and will be able to continue to make a profit due to last year’s rent increase even if rents are
frozen during the economic downturn. She voted to freeze rents at the current level for 2009-2010 so rent-stabilized tenants can get through these difficult times and our city can continue its
economic recovery.
Robert Sokolowsky – Expressed concern about the burlesque theater concept at Marilyn
Drodge’s Harmony Theatre revival at 279 Church St., corner of White Street. Stated that clubs
with sex, bondage and burlesque activities should not be permitted in this neighborhood.
Susan Streit and Avery Miller – Announced the opening of seasonal green markets that sell
produce from farms within 200 miles of NYC. For more information go to: www.ceyc.org.
Greg Kirschenbaum – (B.P. Scott Stringer’s Office) - thanked all who came to the rally to
restore Community Board budgets and invites all to attend the July 13th Small Business
Conference (the IRS will be present). The MBP issued a report focusing on using tools such as
zoning and tax abatements to increase availability of healthy food.
Erin Drinkwater – (Congressman Jerrold Nadler’s Office), a station optimization program is
being implemented to keep the postal service on track. They’ve been remiss in various ways.
CB 1 members noted that services at the Church St. station have been reduced and there are no
longer stamp machines there.
Jessica Loeser – Identified herself and noted that she was available to discuss or answer
questions about the development of a seven story residential building at 46-48 Lispenard Street.
Michele Quigley – AHRC, evaluates adults and children for behavioral and other services.
Michele.Quigley@AHRCnyc.org. Offered the AHRC facility for a meeting.
Andy Neal – Opposed the liquor license application for 27 Desbrosses Street.
Paul Goldstein – (Assemblyman Silver’s office) informed us that the school on Spruce Street
will open in a year. Issues related to the middle school have been settled. There is also potential
space for middle school students at 26 Broadway where space will be taken over by the Board of
Ed. The Gateway Plaza deal has been approved, allowing 11 more years of rent stabilization. A
continuation of commercial tax incentives for Lower Manhattan has been approved. The SLA
500-foot rule has been clarified in the Assembly, so that any 3 establishments will fall under the
rule, not just 3 establishments in a single category. The City is delaying the Chatham Square
project.
Daniel Koffler - Just learned about the LMDC Small Business Assistance Program and is
concerned that the Claremont School at 41 Broad Street is not eligible. The Chairperson said
that Ro Sheffe has been effective in this area and will look into this.
Joel Kopel – C.B. 1 Treasurer thanked the troops for the ballgame win.
Mary Cooley – (State Senator Daniel Squadron’s Office) informed us that the State Senate had
been ordered to reconvene this afternoon. Governor Paterson has put his foot down and wants
both sides to go back to work. What is needed is a bipartisan operating agreement that leaves the
question of leadership aside while enabling the Senate to pass the legislation that is so important
2for our city and our state.
Business Session:
The May 26, 2009 minutes were adopted as presented.
Chairwoman’s Report:
Chairwoman Julie Menin noted that:
 She and several other Board Members met with Chairperson Amanda Burden of the City
Planning Commission today regarding the Tribeca North rezoning. The meeting went
very well and the board’s ideas were well received.
 The Port Authority and Silverstein Properties are still deeply divided. The Community
Board wants public amenities, e.g. the performance center as well as other cultural
components, to move forward. Cited Jazz at Lincoln Center as the kind of use that could
go into an office tower.
We don’t know yet what will be built on Tower 5. It could be the location for a free-
standing performance center. Co-chair Catherine McVay Hughes suggested that since
the Tower 5 site will be turned over before the others, it would be a preferred location for
a cultural center.
 Intoxication on construction work sites in CB1 will not be tolerated. We’re pressing for
strict enforcement and the use of alcohol should be monitored very carefully. The Port
Authority has assured us that workers found drinking have been terminated. We shall
take up this issue at upcoming meetings because a zero tolerance policy must be
implemented.
 LMDC’s RFP for Lower Manhattan schools is moving forward. The grants will be
available to all schools in the catchment area. Members of the LMDC will be present at
the July Youth Committee meeting.
 Thanks to B.P. Stringer and others for successfully advocating for restored funds for
community boards in the City budget that was approved.
 Extended thanks, from the Board, to Judy Norinsky for her service; and best wishes in
her new endeavors.
 We are now seeking a community liaison to replace her and a job description has been
sent to the Community Board members and is available at the District Office.
District Manager’s Report:
Noah Pfefferbilt reported on the following issues:
 The CB budgets results are good news. But next year will bring new challenges.
 Send comments and or suggestions regarding the newsletter which was prepared with
valuable assistance from Helena Hovitz.
 Look out for the upcoming report on the CB1 rent stabilization project, implemented by
Tom Goodkind and others. The document will be forwarded to Ro Sheffe for formatting.
3 Thanks to Judy Norinsky. We hate to see her leave, but look forward to working with
Roger Byrom as Chair of the Personnel Committee in finding a replacement for her by
Labor Day if possible.
 Judy Norinsky thanked us and is set to segue her CB 1 experience into a degree in
Neighborhood Preservation at Pratt Institute.

Youth & Education Committee R. Skinner
Programs for youth at the South Street Seaport Museum – Report
Michael Lord is the new Director of Education at the South Street Seaport and will oversee the
upcoming programs, including some for toddlers and restoration of the tall ship, etc.
Zoning for new schools – Report
Sheldon Silver’s Task Force continues to discuss plans for the new Lower Manhattan schools. A
new concept has been designed for the two new schools, “Common Zone.” John White has
promised to return to the task force to provide more information. He has committed to attend an
upcoming committee meeting where he’ll provide additional information. A representative of
the CEC has also been invited.
Use of ball fields at Murray Bergtraum High School – Report
Discussions have been held with the Murray Bergtraum High School regarding use of their
ballfield by Lower Manhattan community organizations. We’d like to increase access to the ball
fields by Lower Manhattan community organizations. We’ll have to continue our dialogue with
the school regarding when and for how long the children use them. We would like to understand
clearly the procedures for use of these ball fields that are in place so that we can have as much
use of them as possible. These discussions will continue.
LMDC RFP for school funding – Report
The LMDC RFP was discussed as was the DOE capital budget. It looks as though the RFP is on
track and needed funding will be available to schools around the start of the coming school year.
Bob Townley has a nature camp. Children are taken to the Catskills weekly to learn about water
outings, etc. July 27th is the next nature trip. July 4th, there will be a noon BBQ and swim at the
Youth Center. Seniors should be told about the swimming pool, etc. We encourage the
intergenerational spirit.
Battery Park City Committee L. Belfer
4Report on issues covered by Leticia Remauro, Vice President for Community Relations, Battery
Park City Authority – Report
Extended appreciation to the Speaker and other elected officials who helped negotiatie an
agreement to extend rent stabilization protections for 11 years to Gateway Plaza tenants as of
midnight today.
The BPC Authority has control of Pier A and is considering what should be included in the RFP.
Anyone with suggestions about what should be at Pier A is encouraged to come to the next
meeting.
Paul Hovitz added his appreciation regarding the BPC success, but added his apprehension
regarding a subsidized program that could threaten our existing community center.
Chairperson Julie Menin acknowledged that we have to be sensitive about this issue, and that the
Manhattan Youth Center is an important Downtown facility.
CB 1 member and Founder of the Downtown Community Center, Bob Townley said that he is
optimistic that all will work out. He acknowledged his concern and hopes that support will
continue for the Downtown Community Center.
Presentation surrounding the proposed West Thames Bridge by BPCA architect – Resolution
Concerns regarding the bridge were stated, especially pertaining to the need for an elevator for
seniors and others. Leticia Remauro requested a write-up of the board’s concerns.
A friendly amendment was made so that the first “Therefore Be It Resolved reads “insists” and
not urges. It was accepted.
Bob Townley believes the whole resolution should be rewritten. (Elevators for the bridge are
needed on both sides.) Linda Belfer reported that there may be issues with the expenses
involved.
Chairwomen Julie Menin added that we should demand elevators on both sides.

Financial District Committee R. Sheffe
Proposal for Newsstand at the Southwest Corner of Nassau and Liberty Streets – Resolution
The building owner objects to the location. The building owner’s representative stated that
because the application requested a location across the street from their building, they didn’t
immediately oppose the proposed site. Now that the owner realizes the newsstand is intended to
be located in front of their building, they are strongly opposed. A motion to table was suggested,
5but the Department of Consumer Affairs gives the community board only 30 days to express an
opinion. Chairwoman Menin reminded the members that tabling it is the same as not taking a
position.

Albert Capsouto agreed that the website is not up to date.
Businesses that have not yet gone out of business have an opportunity to qualify for the LMDC
grant, but not those that have already gone out of business. We are asking the LMDC to extend
the opportunity for a grant to these businesses.

BOARD VOTE: 37 In Favor 0 Opposed 0 Abstained 0 Recused
27 Desbrosses Street Liquor License proposal. The establishment, owned by Ponte, wishes to
open a bar. Some members felt that scant, ambiguous, inconclusive and inconsistent information
was provided by the applicant.
Gunther Bilali, restaurateur, agrees to early closings – 1 AM during the week and 2 AM on
weekends, and promises not to apply for an outdoor café license and not to place speakers on the
ceiling. He also owns Anchor, another local restaurant. He resides at 47 Renwick, apt. 4-B.
Andy Neale, representing several condo boards in the vicinity of the applicant’s proposed
establishment, opined that this is a Trojan horse for a nightclub lounge. Moreover, he provided
testimony from numerous local residents who offered claims contrary to the owner’s statement
that there had been continuous use at this location. In reply, the restaurateur supplied an electric
bill. However, it apparently covered electricity for the public hallways.
There was no Board vote on this matter

Partial Building Collapse at 71 Reade Street – Report
The Buildings Department and the Landmarks Preservation Commission each had a
representative at our last committee meeting. They were thoroughly grilled regarding the
building’s collapse (second building on this block that has had issues within the past 2 years).
The recently restored cast iron façade was destroyed rather than preserved. There were many
violations and residents had made complaints. Both representatives agreed there were problems
with this situation. LPC said more care should be taken in the future, but the DOB felt they’d
done their job.
Lower Manhattan Sidewalk History Board Project – Report
A proposal to place more signboards downtown is not welcome in this landmark historic area.
We don’t want intrusive signage that doesn’t connect to anything. A decision was deferred to a
later date.
Planning and Community Infrastructure Committee John Foss
Columbia Student Studio Project Follow-up Discussion Regarding the Greenwich South
neighborhood. The committee would now like to meet with the City Planning Department to
discuss inclusionary housing as well as with other city agencies that may be helpful in planning a
cohesive community.
A CB1 Infrastructure study done will be conducted in the fall when CB1 hopes to receive
another Urban Fellow from the Borough President.
There is concern that some residential buildings developed with tax abatements after 9/11 are not
living up to the agreements. We shall meet in the near future to learn what if any requirements
were involved.

our area
Proposed Street Co-Naming – Southwest Corner of Reade Street and Elk Street for Frank
Durkan by Mathias Reilly, Friend and Client. The committee is concerned that there are no set
guidelines regarding co-naming of streets. The Chairman asked Chairperson Julie Menin to set
up a task force to establish such guidelines. The primary concern was that although Mr. Durkan
worked in the community, he wasn’t a resident, and therefore there may not be sufficient
justification to name one of our streets after him.
Proposed sidewalk and curb lane closure, on Fridays and Saturdays, 8 am to 8 pm, on South
Street between Beckman and Fulton Streets by South Street Seaport/GGP for the Fulton Stall
Market.

WTC Redevelopment Committee C. McVay Hughes
Fulton Street Transit Center - Update
The conical dome is not actually glass. The connector is expected to be finished in September
2011. The north side will be the first side to open for business in December of this year. The
south side will be open for business, January, 2010.
Lower Manhattan Development Corporation – Update
John DeLibero will take over the duties of Mike Murphy who has resigned as Spokesperson for
LMDC. John will meet with us monthly to provide updates on 130 Liberty St. and other matters
Later this month, Speaker Sheldon Silver will conduct a tour of the decontaminated building.
Drinking at the local bars by construction workers, as described in a recent Post article, is a
serious concern. At the next World Trade Center Redevelopment Committee we will discuss
this with the Port Authority.
8Next month, we hope to have DEP meet with us regarding Local Law 41, which Council
Member Gerson helped pass in 2005, requiring DEP to report annually on progress with
retrofitting of tour buses. Not all of them have been retrofitted according to the annual report.
Quality of Life Committee A. Capsuto
LMCCC met with us as usual. We had a PowerPoint presentation from NYPD Inspector
McCarthy regarding the WTC traffic management center operated jointly by NYPD with NYC
and NY State DOT. It was informative. Sam Schwartz, a consultant, is working to mitigate
pedestrian crossings and improve safety whereas NYPD is managing all of the vehicular
concerns. There is an enforcement task force monitoring all building projects. Discussed
problems on West Street, which is being monitored by cameras as well.
Representatives from EDC, FAA and the management of the Downtown Heliport met with the
committee. If you see an aircraft that appears to be flying too low, you should call: 800-319-
7410 and get the number of the helicopter so an agent can trace it back to the responsible
company and action can be taken.
Councilman Gerson and Madelyn Wils will schedule meetings regarding helicopter usage in and
around lower Manhattan.
Susan Sangara, Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, discussed the risks to different
categories of people from the swine flu. Seniors, 9/11 victims and those with underlying medical
conditions including blood disorders, obesity, etc. provide different challenges. A new vaccine
should be available within a few months.
Catherine mentioned her son’s school where the Swine Flu had affected several children. She’d
like to preempt this flu before school opens. Any product used to clean your hands should
contain 65 % or more of alcohol to be effective.

extend loft law protections to additional tenants. Also, he is sponsoring an initiative, along with
Speaker Sheldon Silver, to reduce the cost of doing business in Lower Manhattan by making
certain existing and new commercial leases eligible for reduced rent. In addition, the New York
State Sales Tax Exemption would help Lower Manhattan businesses purchase equipment for

community as we recover.

Business Session:
The June 30, 2009 minutes were adopted as presented.
Chairwoman’s Report:
Chairwoman Julie Menin reported the following:
The New York City Council Committee on Lower Manhattan Redevelopment held a hearing
focusing on the redevelopment of the World Trade Center site and Catherine McVay Hughes
and Pat Moore testified on behalf of CB1, outlining key CB1 concerns about development on
and around the WTC site, expressing concern about the ongoing delays in rebuilding, and
stressing the importance of all major projects including the PATH station, the Fulton Street
Transit Center and the Memorial adhering to their timelines. Copies of testimony are available
from the office.
She is concerned about continuing reports of children from Lower Manhattan being waitlisted at
local kindergartens for long periods of time, leaving parents unable to make definite plans for the
fall and about uncertainty surrounding the zoning process for PS 276 in Battery Park City and the
Spruce Street School, the two new schools planned for Lower Manhattan. Announced that John
White, an official at the Department of Education, agreed to speak at an upcoming CB1 Youth
Committee meeting regarding the zoning process to begin a dialogue with the community. The
board will do everything possible to advocate for a plan that will meet the needs of Lower
Manhattan families.
3Announced that applications for education grants from the LMDC would be sent to all schools in
the Lower Manhattan catchment area by the end of this week. CB1 will continue to follow this
process closely at our Youth Committee with regular updates from the LMDC and opportunities
for school officials and parents to raise questions.
Announced that an agreement had been signed to retain rent protections for existing tenants at
Gateway Plaza in Battery Park City. This was an important achievement that was due to the
efforts of Speaker Silver who played a key role in the negotiations and to Linda Belfer and other
board members and community activists.
Informed members that the City had authorized $8,000 for the budgets of all community boards
to cover the cost of providing cost of living increases to all City managerial employees. It is the
City’s practice to pass union settlements along to managerial employees to ensure that salaries
keep up with increases in the cost of living. The increase is automatically given to all managerial
community board employees except that the Chair or board must specifically authorize the
increase for the District Manager. The amount of the increase is funded by a specific allotment
of $8,000 from the City and does not come out of community boards’ budgets. A resolution was
distributed to authorize the increase for the District Manager and the Chairperson asked for a
vote. The increase was approved through a roll call by a vote of 38 in favor, 0 opposed, 0
abstained and 0 Recused.
District Manager’s Report:
Reported that he is continuing to work with Roger Byrom, the Chair and other members of the
Personnel Committee to find a Community Liaison for CB1. A great number of applications for
the position were received from people of many different backgrounds and varying experiences.
Several nights of interviews will be conducted.
Announced that the office would be staffed more lightly than usual during the summer due to
planned vacations and jury duty service and Judy Norinsky’s resignation. Thanked Pat Moore
who always offers to help out at these times by attending key meetings and helping out in the
office to reinforce the staff as needed.

Tribeca North Rezoning – Resolution
We appreciate that the Department of City Planning has welcomed and accepted the
community’s input regarding this rezoning.
Michael Connolly proposed an amendment, and Chairperson Julie Menin suggested we adopt it.
The resolution is historic and reflects a healthy working relationship between the Community
Board and Department of City Planning. By going for inclusionary zoning, we take into
consideration the proposed increase in FAR. Chairperson Julie Menin stated that, “Sixty-seven
affordable housing units were initially offered with this inclusionary zoning proposal, and we
would hate to lose that!” Albert Capsouto suggested that the housing piece should certainly be
included in Michael’s amendment.

DOT agreed to make additional changes and therefore, the resolution, as previously drafted, has
been taken off the table. At a meeting the previous evening there was discussion of
consequences from the design including the demolition of Tire Swing Park. The current plan
includes removal of the park’s wooden play equipment and some mature trees, to make way for a
new playground with more modern equipment and water features. Ideally, D.O.T. hopes to
maintain as much of the original park as possible. Also included in the new plan will be a dog
run, community gardens and playing lawns. Anyone wishing to weigh in on this plan was
advised to attend the next BPC working group meeting where the final decision would be made.

Three million dollars remains in funds for grants for small businesses, but there is no more
money to conduct outreach. HUD’s requirements are so onerous that we must think creatively
about how to get the word out to potential applicants. Few local merchants seem to know about
the availability of these funds.Albert Capsouto suggested the application is so daunting that there should be an LMDC, or other

important that we’re able to gather the information needed so that the registry is accurate and
comprehensive.

1. The waiver granted to developers is subject to a time limit of three years;

safely secured, especially paved-over foundation lots completed before tax abatements
expired in 2008 -- such that the latter are excluded from the program;

Community Board for approval; and
The success of the program shall be re-evaluated after its implementation by the City Council at
a future date to be specified.

Downtown Alliance’s Greenwich South plan – Report

Street Fair Task Force
Bill Love reported that the Task Force recently met with Joe Giovanni of Mardi Gras Festival
Productions to discuss our experience this year with street fairs sponsored by Community Board
No. 1. A number of the locations presented challenges this year due to construction issues in
Lower Manhattan. Of the seven street fairs held, three of them were held exactly as planned
(two on Maiden Lane and one on Lafayette) and a fourth (on Greenwich) was one block shorter
than planned but was still almost as financially successful as originally projected. One of the
larger street fairs that had been planned for several blocks along Broad Street was reduced to
Broad from Water to South and brought in $4,000 less than planned. The remaining two fairs
also had to be relocated from their original locations and were less successful financially than
hoped for.
So the bad news was that, due to the construction issues, the seven CB1 street fairs brought in a
total of $26,000, compared with $37,000 as originally projected and $28,500 in 2008. The good
news was that we added four new CB1 fairs this year that were held on City Parks Department
property and did not involve street closures. These four “park fairs” (three of which have been
held, with the last one to be held in early November) will bring in an additional $3,000 each.
Two of the park fairs have been held in Foley Square Park, and the location for the other two is
the sidewalk along Broadway on the west side of City Hall Park. The Broadway location has
proven to be the better of the two. So the total amount that will be raised this year from all of the
fairs combined will be $38,000, well above the $28,500 from 2008 and also exceeding the
planned total of $37,000 for 2009.

number of freelancers are being taxed not only for transportation, but other things as well. This
particular tax will serve as revenue for the MTA.
Bruce Ehrmann – (CB 1 Member and Co-Chair Landmarks) expressed discontent that our
community may, as a result of holding the 9/11 trials in Lower Manhattan, “become a police
state!”
Senator Squadron said the cost of holding the trials here must be analyzed and it would not be
acceptable to turn Lower Manhattan neighborhoods into a police state.
Paul Hovitz – CB 1 Member and Co-Chair of Youth and Education Committee emphasized
the need for our elected officials to look at the reauthorization passed in Albany and other
laws affecting education and tweak them to increase the role for parents. The Community
Education Councils lack the funds they need to carry out their responsibilities.
Tom Goodkind – (CB 1 Member) questioned the Senator about tenant rights.
Senator Squadron expressed the need for more bills to be passed in Albany in support of tenants.
Tricia Joyce – (neighbor and parent) expressed her dismay regarding the lack of progress in
creating additional Lower Manhattan schools to meet the need that will be created by the
expected population growth in Tribeca in coming years. According to calculations, 30 % of
these children who will be living in our area will lack a school to attend.

BOARD VOTE: 23 In Favor 11 Opposed 1 Abstained 0 Recused
Mayoral Control Resolution resulted in the following comments:
B. Love: Questioned the purpose of eliminating Mayoral control.
P. Hovitz: Mayoral control is now a dictatorship. Parents need a meaningful voice.
J. Menin: Agrees with B. Love. Taking away control from the Mayor would mean going
back to the old failed system.

old system would not be brought back.

revisit the issue again afterwards.
J. Menin: Said that Albany would not do anything and asked whether there could be
another way to increase parental input and address other concerns.
M. Connolly: We should address the need for DOE compliance with the reauthorization
legislation.

good working relationship with the Street Activities Permit Office and NYPD.
Applications for 2010 fairs must be submitted by December.

1. Has secured a “lock box” for capital funding for the BPC Library in order to
ensure it will remain intact.

School gym. During non-school hours, the gym would be available to the
community.

for funding for 9/11 responders.
4. Agreed that 9/11 trials should not be held in Lower Manhattan and suggested

5. Every effort will be made to prevent school rezoning option no. 3 from passing.

4. The Battery Park City skating rink has also opened and other projects are in
motion to rebuild and enhance Lower Manhattan.

budgets. Thanked Barry Skolnick, CB1 Board Member who’s soon moving out
of the state, for having identified the site for P.S. 276.
6. Said that a lot of the MTA’s problems are worsened by their lack of credibility.
They should examine their bureaucracy, budget, and credibility.
7. With regards to the terror trials, said that he had written a letter to the Department
of Homeland Security and others asking them to come to NYC to speak to the
Community Board and answer questions about how they plan to mitigate
transportation, safety and other issues. He wants to know what plans are being
made.

 Annaline Dinkelmann – Introduced herself as a tour guide who would like to work with
the community more.
 Greg Kirschenbaum, representative from the Office of the Manhattan Borough President

meeting to discuss safety issues. Goldman Sachs has promised to remove any
broken glass immediately.

Slip in the Seaport. On Sunday, there will be more than 80 vendors. Invited all to

taking a leadership role in efforts to bring about ethics reform in Albany.

decision. Believes that the trial will cause increased security risks for Lower
Manhattan residents as well as drastically affect the quality of life of the community.
This would also be a financial burden on small businesses that are already hurting.
He read a proposed resolution into the record for the Community Board to consider ,
officially requesting that President Obama relocate the 9/11 terrorist trials to a safe,
non-residential area.
Business Session
Adoption of Minutes
2The minutes of the monthly meeting held on November 24, 2009 were adopted as presented.
Chair’s Report J. Menin
Albert Capsouto has an inoperable brain tumor and is undergoing chemotherapy as an
outpatient, as well as radiation.
The Chair presented Barry Skolnick with a citation for his dedication and for helping to
make many improvements to the Lower Manhattan community.
She will not run for another term as Chair of the Board, and she will be stepping down
from the Board completely while moving forward with her television program and
spending more time with her three sons. However, she expressed her feeling that
Community Board 1 is the most dedicated board in the City and has accomplished much
during her tenure as Chair, including advocating for new schools and community centers
and stymieing the DOT’s ill-advised bus plan for Lower Manhattan. Extended thanks to
Catherine McVey Hughes for her many contributions as Chair of the WTC
Redevelopment Center and Co-Chair of the Board and to the District Manager, Noah
Pfefferblit, and CB1 staff Michael Levine, Lucy Acevedo, and Yume Kitasei for their
dedication and work.
District Manager’s Report N. Pfefferblit
New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) will reconfigure, effective
January 4, 2010, the Chambers Street traffic pattern. But in response to a very adamant
request, they have agreed to meet with CB1 before starting the work. The meeting date is
scheduled for next week, in the District Office and all interested are invited to attend.
A drastic budget cut has been proposed for community boards. Noah will attend a
meeting next week where he will be provided with more details.
The CB 1 website is nearly finished and can be viewed by members for suggestions
before it goes live after New Year’s Day. By using a City site, we will save money and
be able to administer the site more efficiently.
We’ve also begun to send out mailers regarding board business. Through the efforts of
Tom Goodkind and others, information on rent-regulated housing in CB1 is now
available for viewing online.
Marc Ameruso – wrote and read into the record a resolution regarding the 9/11 trials.
The resolution urged that the trials be relocated to a non-residential area,
Committee Reports
WTC Redevelopment Committee C. McVay Hughes
3Our Chair has represented us very well and helped bring about major accomplishments.
Many aspects of our community have been improved by Julie Menin’s determination
and hard work. Much of Lower Manhattan’s redevelopment success is the result of
Chairperson Julie Menin’s fierce determination. Julie has been able to help direct money
towards Lower Manhattan’s redevelopment.
1) Lower Manhattan Construction Command Center Update – Report
LMCCC, a key component to downtown, oversees many large construction projects and
works with many agencies in the Downtown area, including the Port Authority. We want

trials. We look forward to working with our new Council Member. It is imperative to
ensure LMCCC’s continued existence through the completion of major projects.

Battery Park City Committee L. Belfer
1) Discussion of noise issues related to NY Waterways Ferry Service – Report
4Complaints from Gateway Plaza residents regarding the ferries have been ongoing. “It is
unlivable.” Copies of a memo sent by Goldman Sachs, dated 2006, stated that the
catamarans are very noisy, but requested ferry service for their staffers.
2a) Discussion of falling glass from Goldman Sachs building on Saturday 11/28 resulted in
the closure of West Street, south of Chambers Street – Report
A near tragic occurrence resulted from a cracked window. Had someone been standing
underneath the fallen glass they could have been killed. Tishman agreed to inspect all of
the windows and take immediate action. Subsequently, three employees claimed that
there was another broken window, but Tishman has denied this claim.
If the 9/11 trials do take place in NYC, some of the money should be designated towards
affordable housing, primarily in BPC.

2) Millennium High School Gymnasium – Resolution
The Millennium High School needs a gymnasium. The school is exploring use of the
ground floor multi-purpose room as a recreation area and wants the DOE to revisit using
the 34th floor as a gymnasium which we support. The cigar store located next door to the
5multi-purpose room affects the air there. The air quality is very poor and has caused ill
effects on at least one of the students.

5) Discussion of school rezoning – Resolution
BOARD VOTE: 38 In Favor 0 Opposed 0 Abstained 0 Recused
School Rezoning Task Force P. Hovitz for A. DeFalco
1) Discussion of School Rezoning – Report
How do the people in Hanover Square and the Financial District fare in this rezoning
picture? People are most supportive of Option #2. Tom Goodkind, although he’s heard
it’s not the greatest, is more favorable of option #2. Option #2 divides the community
board district along Church Street and East. However, Option #1 splits buildings, with
one split in half; therefore Option #2 is the preferred decision. CB 1 member Mariama
James stated that M. Markowitz of the CEC drafted the initial version of proposal #3.
Then the Seaport Parent and Youth organization drafted a similar proposal. This is only a
one-year temporary zoning. All are invited to meet with the committee to discuss the
permanent zoning in the future. All parents are invited to join these upcoming
discussions.
Julie Menin thanked Paul Hovitz and the committee for their tireless work on this zoning
resolution.
Landmarks Committee R. Byrom
1) 60 Pine Street, LPC application for rooftop addition – Resolution
BOARD VOTE: 35 In Favor 0 Opposed 0 Abstained 0 Recused
Financial District Committee M. Skidmore
61) Final completion of security devices and pedestrian improvements upgrade project in the
New York Stock Exchange area – Report
The committee and board have been supportive of this project and are pleased that it is in
its final phase.
2) Presentation on proposed improvements at the Downtown Heliport – Report
Concerns regarding thousands of gallons of aviation fuel being stored at this facility are
intense. They are using containment measures, but security seems lax, e.g., parking is not
as secure as members would like it to be. This landing strip is the one used by the
President when he visits NYC, therefore we should be greatly concerned about safety.
New fliers for LMDC
A business doesn’t have to be losing money in order to apply. A retail establishment, if
eligible, can receive $5.00 per square foot, with a cap of $25K. Bruce Ehrmann urged us
to patronize the longtime neighborhood “Square Diner,” located on Leonard and West
Broadway. The owner reluctantly shared his concerns regarding its financial viability in
the future.
3) Discussion of film shoots – Report
Although we occasionally may feel bombarded by inconveniences generated by
filmmaking in our neighborhoods, this business generates revenue to our city and offers
lucrative jobs to those who work on the films. Therefore, patience may get us more than
complaints. The film industry is not going to leave our cities or our neighborhoods as it
is a lucrative business. If you have a specific complaint, phone the Mayor’s Office of
Film, Theatre and Broadcast with the complaint.
Tribeca Committee P. Braus
1) Removal of Small Truck Ban on Holland Tunnel – Report
Effective January, 2010. Most people who attended the presentation by the Port
Authority at the committee were okay with lifting the ban. Bruce Ehrmann spoke
against lifting this ban and Julie agreed to write to the Port Authority to ask them to
clarify the approval process for the ban removal.
2) 43 Murray Street, Biddy Early’s liquor license – Report
There was much objection to the liquor license renewal at a meeting with the owners.
However, they subsequently returned with a list of planned “improvements” that yielded
no objections from residents

Greenwich South. They agreed upon improvements that are needed at the crossing
between Greenwich St. and West Street through the Battery Tunnel Garage. The
Alliance set up a meeting with the City D.O.T., the Mayor’ Office, the Department of
City Planning and Michael Levine who represented CB 1 to discuss possible
improvements at this crossing.
A commuter bus garage was proposed for the Battery Garage, but the Alliance opposes
this plan. The January meeting will discuss this more thoroughly and all are welcome to
attend and express ideas.

PS/IS 89 AUDITORIUM
201 WARREN STREET
1. Public Session:
A) John Ricker (Office of Comptroller William C. Thompson) introduced the
Comptroller’s Update that attacks the below par Federal Aviation Association
(FAA) performance in the New York Area. The airports’ escalating flight
delays outpace those in the rest of the nation, adversely affecting our
competitive edge in the marketplace. Moreover, New York is recognized as
having the worse flight delays in the nation. Comptroller Thompson is
pushing for a sufficient number of air controllers to be hired to maintain
adequate air flight controls for both departures and arrivals.
 Comptroller Thompson sent a letter to President Bush requesting that he
restore Homeland Security funds for the City so as not to have to drain
taxpayer’s dollars. www.comptroller.nyc.gov.
B) Foiz Ahmed – 130 Duane Street requested that the beer and wine application
be removed from Board consideration until the full Board has an opportunity
to review it.
C) Barry Malin, esq., representing 25 N. Moore Street, asked that the Board
rescind the original support for 200 Water Group LLC at 25 N. Moore Street
because of the applicant’s misrepresentations. The applicant presented a
completely different plan to the State Liquor Authority than was presented to
the Tribeca Committee. The 65 neighbors present are in opposition to this
resolution. Seventy-five protesters attended the Tribeca Committee Meeting,
opposing this resolution.
D) Alan Murabayashi, president of 22 N. Moore Street, also in opposition to 200
Water Group LLC at 25 N. Moore Street, managed by former managers of
Buster’s Garage who presented a misrepresentation of facts for the approval
of its application.E) Paul Goldstein (NYS Speaker Sheldon Silver’s Office). Deutsche Bank has
been mute until LDI Services was designated to replace the John Galt firm in
the deconstruction of the Deutsche Building. This firm promises to do a good
job as it has a good safety record. Bovis Lend Lease, site manager who works
for L.M.D.C., was also present and determined to ensure that safety takes
priority. Mr. Master, supervisor for all of Bovis’ projects will be the person in
charge of 130 Liberty Street and his staff will be there around the clock.
D.E.P. indicated that they will also work around the clock with L.M.D.C.
 The noise at the WTC is a concern. There is a plan to mitigate the noise,
including windows for the local residents living adjacent to the site and
equipment will be put in place to quiet the noise. Ceasing the work at 11 PM
is now the noise abatement highlight.
 Elected Officials are working with Gateway and Battery Park City to
continue rent stabilization. A letter has been sent out to the Lefrak
organization to this end.
 Merril Lynch is expected to renew their lease at the World Financial
Center for another 5 years.
 $400 M is expected to be set aside this year for the affordable housing
efforts throughout the state.

will be held on January 31, at the Precinct. All are welcome, last Thursday of
each month at 6:30. First Precinct Council’s email is www.firstprecinct.org.
E) Bess Matassa (Office of Assembly Member Deborah J. Glick) is opposed to
the licensing of the 200 Water Group LLC at 25 N. Moore Street and their
misrepresentation to the State Liquor Authority. She is extremely concerned
about the Greenwich and Duane Streets intersection and lack of traffic
mitigation device. She hopes to arrange a joint meeting with the other elected
officials and Department of Transportation Commissioner to make this a safer
intersection. Additionally, she has serious concerns with Intro 650 City
Council that will put serious constraints on environmental testing. She
opposes it because it is an antithesis of an open democracy.
F) Michael Post, local artist will submit an application for a grant to LMCC
soon. He’s interested in bringing additional art to the area. The site of
interest is located between the Customs House and Bowling Green Park, in
the plaza; and a site at Wall St. and Exchange Place. He’s also open to
suggested sites.
G) Erin Drinkwater (Office of State Representative Jerrold Nadler) – Labor
Appropriations Bill, including $ 108 Billion dollars of funding for health
needs related to 9/11. This is the first time funding will be available for
residents and students. The Congressman is concerned about City Council Intro 650. If this was in
effect on 9/11, there would be serious ramifications pertaining to independent
data gathered to state that the EPA sampling was incorrect.
 Calls pertaining to the placement of mailbox have been received
 Pier 26, Hudson River Park Chair, Diana Taylor follow-up meeting, with the
Community Board will continue.
H) Matt Viggiano (NYS Senator Martin Connor’s Office) updated us on Senator

review this plan and his office will work closely with the PA and the
Community Board with the anticipation of creating a quieter Greenwich Street
South Area.
 Matt Viggiano (NYS Senator Connor’s Office) participated in a Battery Park
City Community Center Task Force meeting to discuss a Request For
Proposal.
 Matt Viggiano (NYS Senator Connor’s Office) also attended the recent
Tribeca Committee meeting in response to 130 Duane Street Hotel, proposal
for a wine and beer license. The Senator’s concern is that if we allow this
boutique hotel to acquire the license, they will return for a full-fledged liquor
license that would therefore establish a precedent that we do not want.
 Nelle Fortenberry, President of The Friends of Washington Market Park,
which has been lobbying for a comfort station, a 300 square foot structure, for
many years. Council Member Alan J. Gerson earmarked, through the
Department of Parks, the seed money for the comfort station and secured the
remainder from L.M.D.C. in 2006. Of the 3 viable sites, the recommended
site is in the northwest corner of the park that borders the IPN fence and the
BMCC stairs. The Friends of Washington Market Park requests: (a) the
relocation of the 8 plots on the eastern part of the garden following
construction, restoring the garden to 60 plots; (b) the reconstruction of
heirloom plants during construction; and (c) that the 60 gardeners will act as
consultants when discussing issues pertaining to soil, etc. during the
restoration and enhancement of this lovely park and community garden.
 Sanford Wurmfold, representing the Friends of City Hall Park. Respectfully
asked CB 1 to continue our vigilance regarding City Hall Park. He said the
greening of the plaza has not taken place and complained that City Hall Park
is being used as a gymnasium for several schools. He would like for the park
to be maintained properly and used accordingly.

Hotel, the only boutique hotel that wants a beer and wine license.I) Pam Frederick – Friends of Washington Park Board, followed Nelle
Fortenberry’s position that Parks has chosen the best site for the bathroom.

increase public access to various community boards through Civic Channel

Performing Arts Center at BMCC, there will be a meeting to further discuss
this.
K) Anne Libby – Duane Street Block Association, is in support of the N. Moore
Street residents pertaining to paying very close attention in monitoring liquor
licenses. It’s important that we look closely at these neighborhood
establishments to protect our teens.

A) Executive Committee J. Menin
1) New York City Traffic Congestion Mitigation Commission’s Final
Implementation Plan – Resolution

concerns about deleterious affects that will be thrust upon Lower Manhattan
residents. We’ve therefore asked for a tax credit for low and middle income
residents. CB 1 Member Marc Ameruso expressed strong objection to
congestion pricing and feels that if it’s implemented, ‘Manhattan residents with

objection. Albear Capsuto emphasized the effects on the small businesses, more
than on residents, in the Lower Manhattan Area.

2008 March 25,https://www.nyc.gov/assets/manhattancb1/downloads/pdf/full-board-meeting-minutes/FBM_Minutes_08-03-25.pdf,"MINUTES OF THE MONTHLY MEETING OF
MANHATTAN COMMUNITY BOARD # 1
HELD
ST. JOHN’S UNIVERSITY
101 MURRAY STREET, AUDITORIUM
MARCH 25, 2008
I. Public Session:
 Mohammed Ali – Zucotti Park vendor complained that his livelihood was
taken away when he and other vendors were mandated to move to make
room for the Greenmarket.
 Mohamed Reda – also a displaced Zucotti Park vendor who has worked at
the same location since 1992 complained about the move.
 Aaiai Aziz – another vendor who was displaced.
 Abdebbl Affezz – displaced vendor seeks community board’s assistance.
 Theresa Gonzalez – a self-employed vendor and taxpayer who supports
her family for more than 20 years and now doesn’t know where to go. She
needs her place.
 Fikvy Ahmed – another Greenmarket vendor whose spot supports his
livelihood.
 Sean Basinski – former vendor and attorney at the Street Vendor’s Project
of the Urban Justice League protested on behalf of the displaced vendors
surrounding the Cedar Street area, claiming the vendors had no advance
notice of the change.
 Ken Migliorelli – farmer and vendor who first lost his place when the 9/11
attacks displaced him. He doesn’t have the same opportunities to move
the farmer’s market as do the pushcart vendors.
 Senator Martin Connor – reported that the recent events that transpired in
Albany have delayed the budget. Much progress has been made
considering the new Governor’s challenging task of having to pick up a
budget at a late stage. LMDC has agreed to decontaminate 130 Liberty
Street before deconstructing it. The City will not receive the amount of
money initially sought from the State. Community Board cut-backs will
need to take place. Congestion pricing is still questionable, and there isconcern about how to address drivers coming into Manhattan from New
Jersey and the MTA’s credibility does not register above the midway mark.
We do not want to embark on something as huge as congestion pricing unless
we feel certain the monies received from the pending plan will be directed
toward capital improvements – the intended target. The City Budget will cut
back the recently approved 7-day a week library access to the current 5-day a
week operation. However, given Speaker Silver’s adeptness at wording
legislature I’m confident we’ll get what we need. The congestion pricing
support is very conditional. There is deep concern for the impact of forcing
the average resident to be further taxed.
 Rudy Greco – Senator Connor’s new representative, introduced himself.
His contact # is: 212-298-5565.
 Pauline Yu (Mayor’s Office), gave her contact information,
pyu1@cityhall.nyc.gov.
 Gregory Brender (B.P. Stringer), the Borough President is very concerned
about recent deadly crane accidents.
 Bess Matassa (Assemblywoman Glick) – concerns regarding the delays
for completing school construction. Is pushing DHCR to make regulatory
changes regarding demolition of rent-regulated units. She supports
Councilmember Tony Avella’s bill regarding the inhumane practice of
animal carriages, which are very dangerous to pedestrians, and urges us to
support him on this. Adult education is also of great concern to
Assemblywoman Glick.
 John Ricker (Comptroller William C. Thompson), encourages us to refer
homeowners on the brink of foreclosure to the comptroller’s website for
preventative measures. John can be reached at 212-669-3668. The
comptroller’s website address is: www.comptroller.gov.
 Allison Pulizzi – Total enrollment in the WTC Pediatric study of children
in the target area is a mere 35%. To participate in the study, you would
have had to enroll in 2003 or 2004. Ms. Pulizzi can be reached at 212-442-
2429. The WTC Pediatric guidelines are in effect now, but the adult
guidelines are in review.
 Jon Silvan – David Bouley supporter.
 Dana Sottile Reymond – Another Bouley supporter, as his presence
increases her and others’ real estate.
 Diane Rohan – Also a David Bouley supporter, along with FDNY Engine
6 whose letter of support she read.
 Lance Lappin – local businessman who also believes in David Bouley and
supports his efforts to be granted another liquor license, “which he
rightfully deserves,” for his new restaurant.
 Ivy Lappin – a friend and supporter of David Bouley would like his liquor
license request to be granted.
 Amy Sewell – has received many freebies from Bouley and therefore
supports his application.
 Kazie Parker Davidson – Said she is very active in the neighborhood and
supports David Bouley. Dr. Maria Nardone – supports the liquor license request for David
Bouley’s “Brushstrokes.” He stated that Bouley’s code violations are low
in number compared to others, citing Nobu as one of the others.
 Anna Pomykala – David Bouley’s assistant read a letter reflecting David
Bouley’s generosity when he assisted at Ground Zero.
 Jay Futch – Bouley’s General Manager, formerly with Disney World,
reviewed issues raised by the Tribeca Committee and is making every
effort possible to make this restaurant a positive and good neighbor. He
said, “the chef will bring a true Japanese experience to Tribeca.”
 Cynthia Vance Abrams – neighbor, supports David Bouley, “a visionary.”
She and her husband volunteered along with him in the aftermath of 9/11.
 Liat Silberman – another of the list of previous speakers who are affiliated
with local organizations that have received generous donations from
David Bouley, and wholeheartedly supports David Bouley’s liquor
license.
 Rick Landman – announced his departure from Community Board One,
with the hope there will be future openly gay CB 1 Members.
Additionally, he would like to see new reforms at CB 1. The media
seemed to have been his only opportunity to communicate displeasure on
some issues and the geographical structure of our committees, especially
in the area of ULURPs.
 Sydney Licht – a working artist, 85 White Street, is proposing an FAR of
5.0 for the proposed C6-2A rezoning for 84 White Street.
 Cassandra Dillenberger – resident of 83 White St. is requesting a
contextual change to line up 85 and 83 White St. so that the streetscape
won’t be awkward.
 Kevin O’Kane – owner of 88 and 90 White St., would like a caveat not to
restrict the development if rezoning is approved. He favors the C2-6A
rezoning plan.
 Mary Hahstritt – an industrial historian, and wife of the next-door owner is
in favor of industrial historical streetscapes. Although the C6-2A will
increase the value of the property, its historical value is more important to
them.
 Susan Needles – Tribeca Partnership, needs our financial support to assist
with the mission of helping homeless people who are trying to put their
lives back on track, by hiring them to sweep our local streets daily. This
organization is 99% funded by residents and businesses in Tribeca and
SoHo. Many of the workers learn skills after they have swept our streets.
Julie Menin will be one of the Partnership’s honorees for 2008.
 Owen Foote – EDC, reported on the Phase 2 portion of the Lower
Manhattan Financial District’s streetscape and security improvements.
Amenities will be installed throughout several streets and historical
annotation will appear on the walls of some buildings. His phone contact
is: 212-312-3748. They will not be using cranes.
 Tom Goodkind, CB 1 Member and Conductor of the Tri Battery Pops
gave CB1 members the Pop’s most recent CD and invited the board to theband’s upcoming engagements, including the Little League Parade and the
Bogardus Viewing Garden show.

Resolution.
In Favor: 35. Abstained: 5.
4) 109-111 West Broadway, application for liquor license for Brushstrokes Real
Estate LLC – Resolution.
 Julie Nadel reiterated the following issues: that there were charges that David
Bouley’s conduct during the aftermath of 9/11 was fraudulent and he went to
federal court to respond to insurance fraud charges; carbon monoxide
poisoning resulting in diners being carried out of the establishment; and idling
black cars emitting noxious fumes in the area; and many former staffers and
partners, including his executive chef have abandoned David Bouley.
 Marc Ameruso; opposes the Boluey OP application based on the bad history
cited by Julie Nadel and says that receiving a liquor licenses is not a right, but
a privilege. He noted that several public speakers in favor of Boluey had some
type of relationship with him. Ameruso also wanted to know how David
Boluey obtained all CB members email addresses and suggested the BP and
CB board office look into it. Ameruso was also concerned that board memberswere being asked by Boluey and his attorney Warren Pesetsky, to recuse
themselves for expressing their opinion.
 John Fratta is also concerned about the method by which David Bouley
received our emails, and also is opposed to the request made by his
representative for Julie Nadel to recuse herself from the vote.
 Andy Neale would like to have heard comments from Bouley supporters who
have not received free food from him. Bouley is not a good neighbor and is
known within the industry as such. Former workers have complained how
unpleasant it was to work with him.
 Albert Capsuto read an article highlighting David Bouley’s successes. He
disagrees that a liquor license is a privilege, nor should it be looked upon as
one. Bouley’s first restaurant, Montrachet, was the first 4-Star restaurant in
Tribeca.
 Bill Love suggested two (2) ‘whereas’ clauses stating that the applicant agrees
to address the traffic problem as it relates to the black cars, emissions, etc. and
also another ‘whereas’ whereby the applicant agrees to address sidewalk
cleanliness by utilizing a pressure washer.
 Peter Braus opposes too much oversight as to the type of restaurants we want
in Tribeca and questioned what kind of restaurateurs we want in Tribeca.
“Black cars idling” is a sign of success and we have to understand the
message we send to the business community and not to discourage them from
bringing business to Tribeca.

MANHATTAN COMMUNITY BOARD # 1
HELD
May 27, 2008
120 Warren Street
Downtown Community Center
I. Public Session
A) Comments by members of the public
(3 minutes per speaker)
II. Business Session
- Daniel Squadron – Opposes the Duane Street Hotel’s beer and wine license
application and strongly urges the community to reject the proposal.
- Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer – Welcomed CB 1’s new board
members and thanked Vice-Chair Catherine McVay Hughes for chairing
“Construction Watch” Borough wide. He advised that the initiative will
involve the Department of Buildings and will monitor construction programs
going on throughout the borough. The Department of Building’s Acting
Commissioner LiMandri promises to look at problems at all construction sites.
 The Borough President also voiced great concern regarding the growing
problem of school overcrowding. We’re now reviewing data that indicates a
3,900-seat shortage in the city’s schools. Numerous schools are already over
capacity. He noted that Comptroller Thompson is also working with the
committee addressing concerns about our overcrowded schools, construction,
etc. There will be a meeting at P.S. 234 on June 12th. We continue to
advocate for additional resources with the hope of resolving some of these
issues soon.
 B.P. Stringer reported recent negotiations that will result in regular Cable
access through a Civic Channel TV that will be available to the public, thus
allowing broader public access to issues pertaining to community activities,
events and issues that our local Community Boards discuss, propose and
resolve.
1 Encourages us all to study Charter revisions to broaden our understanding of
land-use as we prepare to make decisions for future developments. He cited
PlanNYC, a forward thinking document to study so that we can effectively
participate or act as spokespersons, as necessary.
 Discussed the budget and the growing fiscal crises. Our priorities must be
rational. In tandem with cutting, we must balance our spending and identify
stopgap measures when identifying schools overcrowding issues.
 The city needs a more aggressive Capital Plan, which is a five-year plan.
 Acknowledged politically motivated parents who are forming a movement to
improve our schools.
- Bob Townley, Director of Manhattan Youth Community Center and host for
this first meeting at the new center – thanked the community and all
community board members for their diligence and good will in making the
center a reality. For 17 years, Bob has worked toward this goal and looks
forward to its success.
- Bess Matassa, Assembly member Glick’s Office – Bess will leave our
community as she is going to be pursuing other opportunities. She circulated
a survey that assesses what is needed to improve problems with city schools.
The Assembly member can be reached at glickd@assembly.state.ny.us.
- Erin Drinkwater, Congressman Nadler’s Office – The congressman will attend
the very important 130 Liberty Street Community Advisory Meeting Friday,
May 30, 2008. The Pier 26 meeting will take place in June. The money
issues surrounding the Hudson Park Trust are being studied carefully. An
effort to combat mailbox graffiti has resulted in an “Adopt a Post Box” plan
whereby concerned neighbors will receive blue and green paint to use to paint
the affected mailboxes. All interested should contact the Congressman’s
Office.
- John Richter – Comptroller’s Update. Asked NYC Dept of Aging to revise
Service delivery plans to seniors. The Comptroller has proposed changes to
current forms, to provide more transparency. Concerned about water and
sewer ratepayers’ payments, he sent a letter to the Water Board suggesting
steps to help ease the burden for more New Yorkers. This letter and
suggestions about transparency and accountability in the city’s budgeting
process can be found on Comptroller Thompson’s website:
www.comptroller.nyc.gov.
- Paul Goldstein – Speaker Silver’s Office was very concerned about the
accident that occurred on the Goldman Sachs construction site, so close to the
Little League’s ballpark. This accident has resulted in immediate work
suspension, as well as a new safety plan to go beyond the current safety plan.
We have received from Goldman promises that there will also be a temporary
weekend work suspension. The new safety plan will include netting on
various floors and an independent site supervisor.
 School overcrowding – Speaker Silver is chairing a special task force to come
up with interim solutions to reduce school overcrowding. Bob Townley has
agreed to consider donating some space for a short-term solution to resolve
some of the school overcrowding issues. Battery Park City space is also being
2considered. Tweed Court House space is also under consideration as are other
alternatives. Input will be appreciated in making suggestions and commenting
on those mentioned. The Speaker supports the Fiterman Hall resolution. The
Speaker is also paying close attention so that the City does not shortchange
the school budget. He is also reviewing the affordable housing issues.
- Rudy Greco, Senator Connor’s Office – The Senator urges DOB to look into
the activities surrounding the Goldman Sachs construction last weekend when
the accident occurred. He also recently met with Luis Sanchez, Department of
Parks regarding local issues.
- John Scott – Is organizing a Green Fair that will offer, among other things,
electronic recycling. Warren St. between West Street and North End.
- Gideon Friedman, Downtown Alliance – Supports resolution in favor of 50
William Street’s Special Permit for underground parking.
- Goldman Sachs Representatives – Jeff Schroeder regarding 5/17th incident.
They care about the safety of everyone and will not allow Tishman
Construction, which shares this concern, to work again until safety measures
have been improved. They care deeply that the construction site is a safe one.
2) Timur Galen - Safety is important. 3) John Livingston, President of
Tishman Construction, expressed his sorrow regarding the incident. He
considers the safety of the community to be foremost and informed us that this
incident was the first of this nature. The company is implementing additional
safety measures, i.e., tying down the metal plates from the hoist, installing
full-height netting rather than limiting it to the 6,400 required by the
Department of Buildings.
Adoption of Minutes – Unanimous.
A) Chairperson’s Report J. Menin
 Requested on-site safety monitor, no weekend construction work at the
Goldman Sachs site during the Little League Season.
 Port Authority funding deficiency for the Calatrava Path Station. We will
fight for full funding.
 Avi Schick will join the private sector, but as Gov. Patterson has requested, he
will stay on as LMDC and GIPEC Chairman.
 Thanks to DOB for issuing the stop-work order on construction at the
Goldman Sachs site and not lifting it until Goldman Sachs met with the
community board.
 Recent board appointments include: Former NYS Assemlymember Paul
Viggiano; and Peter Braus Co-Chair of the Tribeca Committee.
 Testified at a City Council Hearing on the WTC Memorial, convened by Alan
Gerson.
 Our district’s population growth is an indication that there is a great need for
proper planning.
 In 2010, District #1’s population is expected to be approximately 76,000, up
from 26,000 in 2001. There is no other neighborhood that has experienced
3 In another incident at a construction site, debris fell from 130 Liberty Street,
causing great concern for CB 1. Julie and Catherine McVay Hughes wrote a
letter to David Emil to request a special session to discuss this incident.
 Joined B.P. Scott Stringer at his press conference opposing the budget cuts to
Community Boards.
 Bill Love pointed out 2 inconsistencies, non-compliance issues involving CB
1 practices and our by-laws; The first inconsistency is that our by-laws state
that all board actions shall be decided ""by a majority vote of those members
present and voting,"" whereas the community board provisions of the City
Charter require that the action shall be by, ""The majority of the members
present entitled to vote during the presence of a quorum."" A vote to abstain
has the same effect as a ""no"" vote with respect to passing a motion. For a
resolution to pass through committee of 40 there must be 21 or more “yes/no”
votes. The second by-law inconsistency is that our by-laws state that the
quorum for a committee or task force meeting ""shall be one-third of the
membership of any committee or task force."" State law, however, requires
that ""a majority of the whole number . . . shall constitute a quorum"". A
committee or task force will need a minimum of 8 “yes/no” votes to pass a
body membership of 15.
C) District Manager’s Report N. Pfefferblit
Mayor’s proposal reflects a 5% reduction representing a $ 10K deficit. Our
priority will be to maintain our current staff, but we cannot use private funds
for city allowances. The Community Board Office may need to change a staff
member to a consultant status because doing so would enable the use of private
funds for all or part of the consultant’s salary. Spoke at a City Council hearing
on the budget where many of our Council members supported the Community
Board and our need to for the monies proposed for cuts.
 Basha Estroff, Planning Fellow from the Borough President’s Office is
graduating and will be leaving to pursue a full-time career. She was very
helpful in providing demographic information that will be very helpful to our
Community Board and she was highly respected and liked by all. Basha
received a jubilant show of appreciation for her dedicated and tireless work
with Michael Levine on the CB 1 Use Groups. The results of her work are
now a foundation for us to follow.

Planning project. General Growth has offered us 29,000 sq. ft. of usable space
for a community center.
F) East Side Community Center Task Force - Report J. Fratta
Bob Townley inquired about “assisted living” for seniors. To deliver senior
housing is a serious area to consider. Mariama Jones responded that the East

RE: 130 Duane Street, application for wine and beer license for Duane Street
Hotel – Resolution.
Beer and wine application presentation by representatives of the Duane Street
Hotel went to the Full Board after it fell short of winning the Committee’s
approval. The threshold for a public hearing for a liquor license does not apply to
a beer and wine license. The applicant is not the previous owner. Neil Shah, the
sole owner, says he wants to target upscale and high end clientele and to cater
primarily to international travelers. He also said he wants to continue working to
gain the trust of our community.
- Tammy To – Council Member Gerson – opposes the application.
- Andrew Daugherty – referenced 2 letters of support from business owners in the
area.
6- Linda Pollak – resident of 130 Duane Street countered the assertion by another
speaker that the owner of this hotel is not the same as of the prior business. She
opposes the application based on size and location of where the bar will be
situated. The opening is next door to her building’s entrance.
- Jean Grillo – Pres. of the Duane Street Alliance and representing more than 50
Duane Street residents and businesses, opposes this proposal.
- Jeremy Gentry – spoke in favor for the license.
- Jeff Ehrlich - opposed the license.
- David Cleaver - favored the license.
Room service, mini bar and bar downstairs will provide wine and beer if this
license is approved.

RE: Governors Island – Update.
Opens this weekend, kicking off with various activities. The B.P. just donated
$500,000.00 to Governors Island.
I) WTC Redevelopment Committee C. McVay Hughes
RE: Update on Metropolitan Transportation Authority Fulton Street Construction.
- Uday Durg, Capital Construction, reported continuing progress with the
8undeground work, yet no news has surfaced regarding the above-ground
structural design. MTA will return to meet with us in June or July – hopefully
with good news, since the architect is looking to repackage the bids.
 Since MTA is negotiating the scope of work with the Port Authority, the
reopening of the R/W Cortland Street is expected to take from 6-8 months.
RE: Report on Lower Manhattan Construction Command Center updates
Robert Harvey, Acting Executive Director gave a “terrific” Power Point
presentation, outlining how the billions of dollars will be spent downtown. We’re
not at the hump of the bell curve yet. Manhattan is in non-compliance with
environmental rules. More can be found on:
www.lowermanhattan.info/extras/pdf/051208_cb1latest RNH_small.pdf.
RE: Report on Lower Manhattan Development Corporation updates
Bill Love inquired about the deal between Goldman Sachs, the City, etc.
RE: Lower Manhattan WTC PATH Transit Hub – Resolution.
CB1 asks New York State Governor David Paterson and New Jersey Governor Jon
Corzine to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that the promised entire allocation
– including the contingency funds – intended to fund the Lower Manhattan PATH Transit
Hub remain in place so that the PA can build the WTC PATH Station as designed. CB1
also asks the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which was created to oversee
the development of the WTC site, to become actively involved in this issue.
In Favor: The Board unanimously adopted this proposal.
RE: NYC Funding for Fiterman Hall Redevelopment – Resolution.
Community Board 1 is deeply concerned about the possibly that the promised funding
necessary to move forward with demolishing and redeveloping Fiterman Hall in the
coming year will not be made available. CB 1 therefore urges Mayor Bloomberg to
allocate sufficient funds in this year’s budget to match the amount allocated by the State
so that Fiterman Hall can be demolished and redeveloped as planned. We want this to
move forward as it was recently reported there may not be movement on the project
because of the de-funding issue.
In Favor: The Board unanimously adopted this proposal.
9J) Quality of Life Committee P. Moore
RE: Construction Projects in Lower Manhattan – Update.
 LMCCC is normally scheduled to be the first item at each meeting of this
committee. Please bring any concerns regarding quality of life to the meeting
for discussion and review.
 Film Shoots in Lower Manhattan - Update.
The Mayor’s Office of Film Theatre and Broadcasting (MOFTB) met again
with the committee. They will do their best to place a moratorium on future
requests, in certain areas, but cannot rescind already permitted filming
requests. Filming is a revenue-generating business that employs New Yorkers.
Placing moratoriums on filming would have a negative impact on the economy
and therefore be financially counter-productive. Regarding issues pertaining
to film locations, you may report them directly to either MOFTB during
business hours, or after hours call the NYPD, at: 718-281-1235.
 Placard Parking Presentation - Report.
The NYPD’s Internal Affairs Unit is monitoring this topic.
K) Youth & Education Committee R. Skinner
RE: Incident at the Goldman Sachs Construction Site on Saturday, May 17 –
Resolution.
 There was incredible coordination between City/State/Goldman Sachs and CB
1 Chair, Julie Menin, and others who met for hours to discuss safety measures
that must be put in place to prevent another accident and to ensure the
community that the site provides a safe environment for all. Mark Costello
received a special thanks from Ann.
I In Favor: The Board unanimously adopted this proposal.
RE: Development of gym and indoor field space on Pier 40 for Community Board One
Youth – Resolution.
 Indoor space is needed for a gymnasium and other amenities. If state or city
funds, or tax credits are to be used for the renovation of spaces such as Pier
40, then public amenities for Lower Manhattan families, including those from
Community Boards One, Two and Four, must be considered. There are few
opportunities for desperately needed athletic facilities to be created in Lower
Manhattan – with the exception of state-owned land at Pier 40.
In Favor: The Board unanimously adopted this proposal.
10RE: Battery Park City Library programs for Youth - Report.
Although an extensive program has been promised, there is a shortage of in funds
that can be allocated for the books. There has been discussion about approaching
Goldman Sachs to provide funds for the books.
RE: Murray Bergtraum High School – Report.
The Principal of Murray Bergtraum addressed concerns at a Meeting that all
the students being spoken about may not be enrolled at Murray Bergtraum H.S.
RE: Task Force on School Overcrowding Meeting – Report.
The Task Force is responding to growing concern about overcrowding affecting
our communities and the children residing in them. Schooling must be a priority
in developing communities.
RE: Community Role in Zoning for New Schools – Report.
The Committee will discuss forming a subcommittee to review school zoning.
L) Financial District Committee R. Sheffe
RE: Application for two Vessel Liquor Licenses for SeaStreak, LLC – Gouveneur
Lane and South Street – Pier 11 – Resolution.
In Favor: The Board unanimously adopted this proposal.
RE: Application for a sidewalk café by Pearlstone Burger Corporation d/b/a Burger
Burger, 77 Pearl Street – Resolution.
In Favor: The Board unanimously adopted this proposal.
RE: Application for additional parking spaces at 15 William Street – Resolution.
In Favor: The Board unanimously adopted this proposal.
M) Planning and Community
Infrastructure Committee J. Galloway
RE: Planning and Community Infrastructure – Report.
Progress is moving forward with development of a comprehensive set of
guidelines and principles that will govern the Board's planning-related decisions
(ULURP, etc.) for implementation over the coming years. Jeff presented the
11Committee's resolution – the Borough President's Development Principles for
Manhattan – a questionnaire that will be provided to any developer seeking a
Community Board's discretionary approval in connection with the developer's
project. The Manhattan Borough President's questionnaire is intended to be a
borough-wide document. The B.P. invited each Community Board to create a
district-specific supplement to accompany the questionnaire.
RE: Proposed Development Principles for Manhattan – Resolution.
Borough President initiatives should be based on site-specific criteria relevant to
the application criteria.
In Favor: The Board unanimously adopted this proposal.

MANHATTAN COMMUNITY BOARD # 1
HELD
JUNE 24, 2008
PACE UNIVERSITY
ONE PACE PLAZA, B-LEVEL
Election of Officers – Nominating Session L. Belfer
Prior to the Board Meeting, ballots were distributed to CB 1 Board Members to elect
members to the Executive Board: Chair, Vice-Chair, Secretary, Assistant Secretary and
Treasurer. Nominees delivered speeches for respective positions. The only contested
position was for the Assistant Secretary’s position. Linda introduced all of the
candidates.
Community Board 1 Chairperson, Julie Menin read a written statement by Vice-Chair
Catherine McVay Hughes, who was absent. Catherine thanked CB 1 Members for their
continued support of her ongoing commitment to ensure that Lower Manhattan has the
infrastructure necessary to recover from 9/11 and grow in a manner that insures the safety
and health of all who live and work in this densely populated area, and that “those
responsible need to be held accountable to that standard.”
Julie thanked CB 1 members for their support in her continued efforts and ended by
highlighting her own 3 years of accomplishments including:
 We are the only neighborhood to have the construction of two additional
Downtown k-8 schools; one will be the first green school.
 Completion of one West Side community center and anticipate an East Side
center soon.
 Awarded grants for new playgrounds and ball fields.
 Negotiated successfully with Silverstein Properties to have ultra low-sulfur diesel
fuel on all construction vehicles.
 Increased health awareness for those affected by 9/11.
 Increased oversight for the safe demolition of the Deutsche Bank building.
 Increased opportunities for post 9/11 residents.
 Liquor licenses, noise issues, etc.Noel E. Jefferson, CB 1 Secretary, thanked Community Board 1 Members and District
Office for their continued support and encouragement to run, unopposed, for a second
term.
Chelsea-Lyn Rudder and Marc Ameruso appealed to CB 1 Members for their vote for the
one contested position: Assistant Secretary. Chelsea-Lyn summarized a list of personal
accomplishments and professional affiliations. The incumbent, Marc Ameruso,
highlighted his numerous Lower Manhattan community service activities.
The ballot box remained open for one hour following the candidate’s speeches.
Toward the end of the meeting, Linda Belfer reported the results for the position of
Assistant Secretary: All voted with the exception of one abstention. The election tallied:
26 – 16 in favor of Marc Ameruso.
Public Session
 Erin Drinkwater – Congressman Jerrold Nadler’s Office, reported that 1)
Congressman Nadler accepted the position of Vice Chair for Congress’s Lesbian,
Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Equality Caucus. 2) Congressman Nadler
recognizes the importance of St. Vincent’s Hospital, specifically with respect to
its location and expansion. He nevertheless agrees with the proposal to demolish
its east side.
 Greg Kirschenbaum – Borough Manhattan President Office reported the passage
of two laws Borough President Stringer introduced in Albany: 1) Reduce
incentives for “Warehousing” Vacant Land Above 110th Street. Borough
President Stringer’s vacant property initiative uncovered more vacant land above
110th Street in Manhattan. Real property tax law assesses vacant land above
110th Street at lower rates than below 110th Street, thus encouraging owners to
speculate with their land. Under this new law -- sponsored by Senator José M.
Serrano and Assembly Member Herman D. Farrell -- all vacant land north of
110th Street will be assessed at the higher, commercial rate. This will have the
effect of earning additional revenue for the City, which it can use to develop
affordable housing for New Yorkers. The lower tax assessment will apply to
owners who pledge to build affordable housing through the development process.
Senator Serrano and Assembly Member Farrell are credited for their leadership on
this issue; and 2) Vehicular Law against halting traffic passed. This law, which
was introduced by Assembly Member Brian Kavanagh and Senator Andrew
Lanza, prohibits stopping inside “the box,” also known as “blocking the box.”
The legislation enables the City’s 2,800 traffic enforcement agents to issue tickets
carrying a $115 fine. 3) Training for new Community Board Members was held
yesterday, June 23rd, and 2 more training sessions are scheduled.
 Tom Goodkind – CB 1 Member reported that 1) the Tri Battery Pops will perform
in conjunction with the Macy’s fireworks in front of Wagner Park, on July 4th. 2)
Also, Harvard University has invited the group to visit the University.
2 John Ricker – Comptroller William C. Thompson’s Office delivered the
Community Update and reported that New York City is experiencing “growing
pains” in neighborhoods where school population outpaces available seats.
Comptroller William C. Thompson acknowledges the results are discouraging and
notes flawed projections. City Planners are remiss in not considering each
neighborhood’s needs in connection with development plans. To read the report,
visit the Comptroller’s website: www.comptroller.nyc.gov. Further, Comptroller
Thompson supports legislation to allow hospitals and pharmacists to give flu
vaccinations to stave off fatalities resulting from sporadic flu outbreaks.
 Rudy Greco – Senator Martin Connor’s Office, reported 1) an ongoing police
investigation targeting complaints by tenants of drug activity in Independent Plaza
North. Although a park light was installed, it doesn’t illuminate the benches
where many of the drug exchanges take place. 2) On June 10th, the Chinatown
YMCA honored local politicians who helped increase the number of schools in
Chinatown. Senator Connor, Council Member Gerson and others rallied
downtown for a gymnasium for Millennium High School. 3) The 200 ft. liquor
license rule––which addresses proximity to religious institutions––is being
revamped. When measuring the distance, the building lot line will be the starting
point rather than the establishment’s door. Otherwise, the door could be moved to
alter the measurement as desired.
 Susan Needles – Tribeca Partnership Chairperson thanked Julie Menin for her
continued support and announced Julie’s honoree award at the Tribeca
Partnership’s Annual Benefit. The Partnership’s mission is to train homeless men
and women and reform adults in preparation for reentering a productive society
and preparing for subsequent job opportunities. The Partnership’s population
works to keep our communities clean by picking up trash from the sidewalks and
streets. Because the Partnership is 99% privately funded, it relies on community
donations.
 Allan Tannenbaum, CB 1 Member and photojournalist, congratulated Susan
Needles and the Partnership’s work and noted its success stories.
 Bruce Priveterre acknowledged the Partnership’s 87% success rate in guiding its
population back to being fruitful members of society.
 Numerous local residents expressed support to open up the northern part of City
Hall Park to the public for pedestrian use, but opposed the inclusion of a bike
path. They said they support the proposed bike path the Department of Traffic
wants to create between the Brooklyn Bridge and the Hudson River, but agreed
that Chambers Street is not safe for a bike path and nor would running one
through City Hall Park be a viable alternative.
 Former CB 1 Member Rick Landman of Friends offered an alternate resolution,
disapproving of the bike path as presented by the D.O.T.
 David Truzman – Ayudese Outreach Coordinator, serving the Hispanic
Community. The Spanish Hotline is: 1-877-AYUDESE. This is a major public
health education and outreach initiative for Latinos and Asians. Additional
information can be obtained online at:
www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/about/mha_nyc.aspx.
3 Lisa Lin Ying reported on the recent successful fundraising event for 69,000
China – Sichuan Earthquake victims. This effort is ongoing and needs additional
support. All contributions are appreciated.
 Producer “Rachel” reported on the successful fundraiser for the Chinese victims,
held on Sunday, June 22nd, and thanked all CB 1 Members for their generosity,
but requested that we appeal to all within the CB 1 District for donations and
public awareness to aid the 70,000 victims. Thousands and thousands of children
have been affected. Millions of dollars are needed for the struggle to get funds to
build a school. She noted several CB 1 members who have been especially
helpful.
 Molly Hyojung Bidol – Assembly Member Deborah Glick’s Office reported the
Assembly Member wants clarification of the New York City’s Human Rights
Commission policy on the use of service animals because the current policy is
vague and the HRC has never provided written interpretation of the policy. In
addition to being out of conformity with State and Federal law, this results in
more discrimination and related difficulties for disabled people than would result
under a written policy.
 Diane Stein - Council Member Alan J. Gerson’s Office, presented Council
Member Alan J. Gerson’s newsletter for distribution. In the newsletter, Council
Member Gerson acknowledges the difficult budget year and emphasizes restoring
$243 million for education; $16 million to hire 1,000 additional police officers to
maintain the fight against crime, which is especially important due to increased
gang activity, drug use and street violence, etc.; and $45 million enhancement to
reverse NYCHA’s proposal to close senior citizen centers in an effort to balance
its budget. Additional initiatives include: $2 million to the Department of Health
and Mental Hygiene to combat the ever-growing rodent problem; $3.3 million for
grab bars (OMB tax credit) to seniors, 60 years and older; $4-5 million to DYCD
to better care for homeless and runaway youth; and $555,000 to DOE to provide
science centers throughout the city.

assessment.
Change to CB 1’s by-laws B. Love
RE: By-Law Revisions - Resolution
CB 1 Member Bill Love, Esq. reported that inconsistencies in our by-laws with
regard to our meeting and voting practices were recently identified. Therefore, we
must change our practices to reflect the standard law. The first by-laws
inconsistency reflects our practice that all board actions shall be decided ""by a
majority vote of those members present and voting,"" whereas the community board
provisions of the City Charter require that the action shall be by ""the majority of the
members present entitled to vote during the presence of a quorum."" The difference
is that under the City Charter provisions, a vote to abstain has the same effect as a
""no"" vote with respect to passing a motion. For example, assume 40 members of
CB1 are present at a meeting and no one is required to recuse him/herself (i.e., all 40
are entitled to vote). Under the City Charter formulation, 21 ""yes"" votes (a majority
of the 40) are required to pass the resolution regardless of whether the others vote
""no"" or ""abstain."" Under the current CB1 by-laws, if 10 people abstain from voting,
it would take only 16 ""yes"" votes (a majority of the 30 members who were present
and actually voted) to pass the resolution -- quite a different result. The City Charter
formulation is the stricter one and we have to change our by-laws to conform to it.
The second by-law inconsistency is that our by-laws state that the quorum for a
committee or task force meeting ""shall be one-third of the membership of any
committee or task force."" State law, however, requires that ""a majority of the whole
number . . . shall constitute a quorum."" For example, suppose the membership of
XYZ Committee of CB1 is 14 people. Under our current bylaws, a quorum would
be 5 members (one-third of the 14 members, rounded up). Under the requirements
of state law, 8 members (a majority of the 14 members) would be required for a
quorum.
Again, the state law requirement is stricter and we have to change our by-laws to
conform to it. As a result, we will need to pay greater attention to ensuring that
5committee members attend their respective meetings (or resign if their attendance
record is inconsistent or lagging) to avoid conducting business based in the absence
of a quorum.

Committee Reports
Executive Committee J. Menin
RE: Application for 421-a Tax Abatement by Forest City Ratner for 8 Spruce Street
Development – Report.
Under our by-laws, a resolution may be voted on by the Executive Committee on an
emergency basis when it is not practical to convene a full board meeting, but such a
resolution must then be ratified by the full Board at its subsequent meeting. Such a
situation necessitated an emergency meeting of the committee on June 18, 2008. HPD
brought before the board an application for a 421-a 20-year tax abatement to Forest City
Ratners development project at 8 Spruce Street asking for the board’s approval prior to
our full board meeting. At the June Executive Committee meeting, board members
criticized the policy of granting of such tax abatements––which are specifically intended
to promote affordable housing––to a building with many apartments garnering monthly
rents ranging from $4,000- $15,000. However, weighing the possibility of affecting the
“attached” school construction, the committee voted in favor of a resolution that
disapproves of including such a high-rent building in the 421-a program and encourages
HPD to weigh the board’s input before making a decision on this application, but
acknowledges that the school should not be jeopardized due to a negative decision by the
HPD on this 421-a application. Chairperson Julie Menin will initiate a process to be used
in the future where we comment on 421-a Tax Abatements.

Three Hundred Rector Pl. residents came to us because they are frightened about
what is happening with regard to development throughout the city and concerned
that they may be forced out of their apartments.
RE: The Goldman Sachs construction site in Battery Park City – Report
Timur Galen negotiated originally with Anthony Notaro regarding funds for the
library. GS representatives were apologetic about the sheet of metal that fell onto
the ballpark and reassured the committee that such an incident would not happen
again because they were taking preventative measures.
Seaport/Civic Center Committee J. Fratta
RE: Peck Slip Park Plan – Report
Although months ago the Board accepted the plans as presented, these plans were
subsequently rejected by the State Historic Preservation Office based on objections
to texture and materials. The approval process will have to begin again.
RE: Bike Path at the North End of City Hall Park – Resolution
 Skip Blumberg would like for CB 1 to write a letter to Mayor Bloomberg
demanding that the agreement to increase greenery on the northeast plaza,
made in February 2007, be fulfilled. Skip said that Parks Commissioner Bill
Castro has reneged on his promises and has not since met with us.
 Rick Landman requested that the Department of Transportation and the
Department of Parks be asked to return to CB 1 to show us what the plans will
look like before we vote to approve or disapprove.
Changes to the resolution in support of a bike path in City Hall Park were adopted and
included as follows:
WHEREAS: Bike Riders can now dismount and walk through the Park, making this
proposal unnecessary; and
WHEREAS: The City has not enforced the no-parking laws against placard cars
currently parking on the existing bike path on the eastern side of the park or against the
row of parked cars (or television vans) on the north side of Chambers Street, and hasn’t
looked into an alternative route that would wrap along Chambers Street; now
7THEREFORE
BE IT
RESOLVED
THAT: Community Board #1 disapproves of the proposal to create a Bike Path in
between the Tweed Courthouse and City Hall until the Department of Parks and
Recreation and the Department of Transportation return to CB#1 with a plan that satisfies
the conditions and recommendations set forth above.

how the operation functions. There are 2 tiers of representatives. The first one
forwards calls to the appropriate agencies; and the second tier channels calls to
representatives of the following agencies within the 311 center: HPD, DOT,
DOB, Sanitation and DEP. When calling 311, write down the complaint number
for future reference. If you have a complaint about the 311 Mayor’s Call Service,
call the Executive Group overseeing 311 at 212-504-4405.
A presentation introducing Council Member Gale Brewer’s curb cut legislation
was delivered. Its proposal is to extend oversight for curb cut requests to include
DOT as well as DOB, to extend the review period to 60 days from 30 days so that
community boards can get involved. Council Member Gerson is a co-sponsor of
this bill.
RE: New York City policy on granting access to individuals with service animals in
public places – Resolution
A resolution in support of Assembly Member Deborah Glick’s Animal Service
legislation did not pass in committee because committee members wanted
clarification of the definition of “service animal.”

Youth & Education R. Skinner
RE: “Crowded Out” - Report
School overcrowding is a primary concern requiring population analysis. There is
a definite correlation between population growth and school overcrowding. At
the next Youth & Education committee meeting, there will be a resolution in
response to the conclusions reached in the Manhattan Borough President’s
11“Crowded Out” report. We need school construction to accommodate growth.
We look forward to hearing the School Construction Authority feedback on the
overcrowded school problem.

Con Edison, the Department of Parks and the Conservancy for the British Memorial
Garden are negotiating who is responsible to pay for removal and replacement of pavers
(stones) in the Garden so that a transformer below the pavers can be replaced.
RE: CB1 Residential Population 2008 – Report.
A study completed this spring by Community Board #1 projects that by the year
2013, the residential population of District #1 will reach an estimated total
63,561. This represents an increase of 83% more than the population of 2000, or
an estimated 28,101 new residents.
The Financial District has sustained the bulk of this residential growth,
comprising nearly 70%––a number that could jump even higher if other currently
projected development adds more than 3,000 residents to the neighborhood.
Co-Chair of the Landmarks Committee, Bruce Ehrmann, suggested that we
concentrate on infrastructure BEFORE reviewing applications for new
developments. We need to press for comprehensive planning prior to entering the
ULURP process. Chairperson Julie Menin agreed that we must be proactive by
applying this strategy for Greenwich South and other areas with upcoming
development. More active participation is urged at these meetings to voice the
need for developing infrastructure before approving future developments. Julie
Menin also recommends that this item be put onto the agenda to be included in
our next planning meeting, as well as requesting that a change be made in the
ULURP process.
Mariama James questioned whether this is a function of City Planning. Pat
Moore interjected, “The population explosion is affecting our quality of life as
well.”
12Planning and Community Infrastructure J. Galloway
RE: CB 1 Housing and Population 2008 – Report
Jeff will include our infrastructure concerns at the next meeting. He asserted that
ULURP needs legislative change. It doesn’t capture 90% of what goes on.
RE: Greenwich South Planning Studio update – Report
Columbia University will add the Greenwich South Planning Project as a studio
for its graduate school of planning next year. We’ll thus have help from the
graduate school in developing a plan.
RE: Draft CB1 Supplement to Development Principles Questionnaire.
The board approved a questionnaire supplement and will approve the actual
questionnaire.

HELD
JULY 29, 2008
THREE LEGGED DOG
80 GREENWICH STREET
Public Session
Lee Gruzen – Seaport Speaks
Is happy to see Pier 15 starting to take shape. EDC needs to build a 100% functional
working pier particularly along the edge and dock space areas. Urged the CB to amend
the Landmarks resolution and not to allow cut-outs from the pier.
Vaidila Kungys - NYC DOT - Introduced the Plaza Program, an initiative to create new
plazas in neighborhoods, and asked community board and residents to send DOT
proposed locations for a new plaza.
Michelle Angulo - NYC 9/11 Benefit – Reported NYC 9/11 Mental Health Benefit
Program offers psychological counseling to eligible NYC residents who may be suffering
from the events of 9/11.
To determine eligibility, either call (212) 614-5750; or get additional information online
by contacting Ms. Angulo at: mangulo@mhaofnyc.org.
John Ricker – Office of NYC Comptroller Thompson – Reported Departments of Health
and Education were audited in response to improperly conducted vision and hearing tests.
He also cited that the United Nations owes the City 12 million dollars in back rent. The
current community newsletter is available on the check-in table.
Julie Shahradi - NYC Dept. of the Aging – Reported the Long Term Care Insurance
Resource Center will help with long term care for the aging, located at 2 Lafayette Street,
11 FL. Telephone contact is: (212) 442-1085.
1Molly Bidol – Office of Assembly Member Deborah Glick – Reported on the Assembly
Member’s legislation to prevent landlords from claiming phony demolitions of buildings.
Kevin Cunningham - Three Legged Dog Art and Technology Center – The board thanked
him for providing the meeting space.
Anthony Notaro - CB1 member - Announced National Night Out for crime prevention to
be held on August 5th at 6:30 at Zuccotti Park, Liberty and Church Streets.
Greg Kirschenbaum - Office of Borough President Stringer – Reported that the BP met
with the DOT commissioner regarding the proposed City Hall Park bike path. DOT
promised to listen to community concerns. NYC budget overview will be held on August
4th. The BP is opposed to any MTA fare hikes.
Rick Landman, former CB 1 member - is opposed to the bike path in City Hall Park and
says “the police do nothing when a bicyclist rides through.” An online site has been set
up for the public’s perusal. It is: www.Infotrue.com. And, there needs to be better
enforcement of placard parking abuse.
Ester Regelsom – Resident – expressed her opposition to the granting of a cabaret license
to 94 ½ Greenwich Street, stating that dancing late into the night would disrupt the
quality of life of the neighborhood. She asked the community board to vote against the
application.
John Fratta - CB1 member – Expressed concern over the many street vendors on the
Fulton Street corridor whose presence result in disruptions to pedestrian traffic. He
requests that NYPD and other agencies conduct enforcement so that existing vendors
adhere to current regulatory laws.
Rob Buchanan - New York Harbor Beaches - Thanked the Waterfront Committee and
Julie Nadel for their help supporting the pilot program for kayakers to use Brooklyn
Beach to land their boats. He also asked the full board to pass the resolution stating that
there needs to be continuing progress with the City and EDC for increased public access
to the beach as there is under the Manhattan Bridge in Brooklyn.
School issues:
Patricia Joyce – Resident – is concerned about school overcrowding at PS 243 and PS
89. She argued that temporary space at 26 Broadway is inappropriate for kindergarten
and first grade, but thinks the site could be appropriate for a middle school.
Chairperson Julie Menin concurs with Ms. Joyce’s points and will forward them, with
her concern to DOE. The favored option is the Cove, which we are currently pursuing.
Bob Townley addressed the need to place students in interim locations and said that as an
alternative to overcrowding this may be the only option.
2Paul Goldstein – Office of Speaker Sheldon Silver – Reported about an interim plan
for P.S. 234. Without the Community Center that Bob Townley has graciously offered,
we would be in a less comfortable situation. We have not forgotten the needs of P.S. 89,
but their crunch will come in 2009. DOE has finally hooked up with BPC regarding
possible use of the Cove Club. There might be some use for the 250 seats at 26
Broadway. Also, Speaker Silver’s Task Force has heard the parents’ concerns and is
looking into all options and working with DOE to find solutions. Speaker Silver is
opposed to the MTA fare hike and has suggested an additional tax for those earning
above a certain threshold amount.
Congressman Jerrold Nadler’s Office
 News Update - Joined with others in updating the bipartisan 9/11 Health and
Compensation Act, introduced in the House to reflect new considerations as they
relate to the consequences of the attacks. Speaker Pelosi and the leadership of
both committees of jurisdiction agreed that changes were needed to sharpen the
scope of the proposal. The Subcommittee on Health of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee will hold a hearing on the updated bill on July 31, 2008.
The 9/11 Health and Compensation Act (H.R. 6594) would establish a permanent
program to provide medical monitoring/screening to eligible responders and
community members who were exposed to WTC toxins, and medical treatment to
those who are sick with World Trade Center- related health conditions.” Rep.
Nadler applauded the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Military
Personnel for holding a hearing on the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” (DADT) policy.
In celebration of the 50th Anniversary of the Alvin Ailey American Dance
Theater, the House adopted Nadler’s resolution honoring the dance company.”
 Congressman Jerrold Nadler, Chair of the Subcommittee on the Constitution,
Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties held an oversight hearing on the role Bush
Administration lawyers played in creating, developing, and implementing
interrogation policies that have resulted in the widespread abuse of detainees in
U.S. custody and control.
 Rep. Nadler is urging the House to pass $1.7 Billion in mass transit grants so New
York would receive an additional $237 Million for transit service expansion. The
passing of this bill would allow the infusion of much needed capital to improve
our mass transit system.
 Rep. Nadler also lauds the House for passing the ADA Amendments Act of 2008,
H.R. 3195, the Americans with Disabilities Act, according to the congressman,
would help to restore the Americans with Disabilities Act to its rightful place
among this nation’s great civil rights laws.
Business Session
The minutes of the monthly meeting held on June 24, 2008 were adopted as presented.
3Chairperson’s Report
CB 1 had a very productive WTC Meeting. It was the first time all involved agencies
appeared at the same meeting. The top 10 issues discussed were:
1) Giving our community realistic deadlines for redevelopment of the WTC;
2) Memorial opening for 10th Anniversary of 9/11;
3) Creating a vehicular security center and bus parking facility;
4) Resolving issues related to building the Transit Hub;
5) Commencing fundraising for the Performing Arts Center construction and
bringing additional cultural anchor tenants to that facility;
6) Resolving issues between St. Nicholas Church and the Port Authority;
7) Safely decontaminating and demolishing the 130 Liberty and Fiterman Hall
Structures;
8) Ensuring that the Lower Manhattan Construction Command Center is properly
funded so that construction impacts to the community can be properly
ameliorated;
9) Working with the community to ensure that the retail at the site is not purely
tourist driven, but encourages a 24/7 community; and
10) Determine whether government tenants are the best use for the Freedom Tower
and whether there are ways to attract private-sector tenants.
We have to push hard on City Hall Park to get DOT to agree with us to remove the bike
lane.
Julie sent a letter to the DOT Commissioner in a continuing effort to push for traffic
regulation at the dangerous crossing at Duane and Greenwich Streets.
CB 1 Thanked Bob Townley for offering the Manhattan Youth Community Center for
classrooms.
District Manager’s Report
 All CB calendar and agenda changes will, in the future, be emailed to
everyone, rather than to a selected few.
 CB1 is continuing to work toward moving our website to an official City
website. The Department of Information Technology and
Telecommunications needs to make some technical changes in order for
the City site to serve CB1’s needs. This change will improve our current
website operation.
 Met with SLA last evening to receive update about their procedures. Two
CB1 members also attended.
 Two new summer interns, now working in our District Office, will answer
phones, etc.
4Treasurer’s Report
 There were no budget cuts in our office. Monies not used cannot be rolled
over from one year to the next. About $87,000.00 is now in our till.
However, we lost $3,700 because of a technical City policy that we were not
aware of or informed about in time.

Street Fairs Task Force
RE: Sponsorship of Street Fairs for Fundraising by CB #1 in 2009
As we begin consideration of CB 1’s street fair fundraisers for the coming year, we’re
required to take an affirmative vote to use street fairs as a money-generating vehicle to
support the organization. Additionally, the Street Fairs Task Force must determine the
appropriateness of working with the current promoter, or if necessary, solicit new
promoters for next year’s proposals. Geographic considerations were considered when
granting permission for these street fairs because of the ongoing construction in Lower
Manhattan. We’ve completed 4 of the ‘08 street fairs so far and will complete the others
soon. A couple of fairs have been moved from Maiden Lane, and will also generate more
money for us. We are expecting to earn $30,000.00 for the 7 Street Fairs we sponsored.
We don’t generate money for those that we don’t sponsor.

system for the 1-2-3 line on West Broadway from Franklin St. to Chambers,

extraordinary floods. Although the Committee unanimously voted against this street
furniture because it considered to be too large, obtrusive and unattractive, the LPC
unanimously approved it. Chairperson Menin will ask Councilwoman Jessica Lappin and

RE: General Growth Property
General Growth Properties wants to move the tin building to the pier the company plans
to build, but the committee and full board believe that it has to offer much more to CB 1
before we will agree to its proposal. GGP wants to build a 44- story tower that would
require zoning approvals, whereas they can build a 35-story building as–of-right. We
will have six months within which time to review this proposal. But, we want more
amenities before approving it, e.g. a community center or school.
Waterfront Committee

RE: Horse-Drawn Carriage Ban and House Pets. The committee decided not to proceed
with this issue because it doesn’t affect our community.
8Youth & Education Committee
RE: School overcrowding
Rebecca Skinner expressed the committee’s excitement that CB 1 has taken a proactive
role in this situation. However, because the committee didn’t have a quorum, the
committee vote was not official. Julie Menin expressed the seriousness of committee
meeting attendance to ensure the presence of quorums.

RE: Subcommittee Formation on School Zoning for Year 2008-2009–– School zoning

RE: School Overcrowding Meeting Held on July 14th––Ann DeFalco reported the
following items from the recently held meeting: 1) a written request for plans for schools
in the district; and 2) need for involvement by the community. Congresswoman Carolyn
Maloney and Comptroller William C. Thompson attended the meeting and expressed
support for community needs. The meeting also highlighted the extent of the need for
additional seats in School District 2. Namely, we need to know which community areas
will be zoned for the two new schools so that we can identify which children will be
given priority for the new space.

RE: 421-a Tax Abatement application for 56 Leonard St. and 254 Front Street
The board has the right to proffer an advisory opinion on 421-a tax abatement proposals.
Under the regulations, community boards must comment within 45 days. We sent a letter
requesting more information on the N.Y. Law School project. Bruce Ehrmann noted that,
“as the largest building to be built in this area . . . it should be discussed with the full
board.” This item is on the September agenda, and can be further discussed there.
RE: General Growth Properties South Street Seaport Plan
GGP has presented its plan to us. The plan will require several approvals from the
Landmarks Preservation Commission and a ULURP application will be filed
subsequently. These applications will be considered by CB1 in meetings in coming
months. It is our decision to determine whether we do or do we not want to accept their
proposal.
RE: Proposed Changes to the City Uniform Land Use Review Process
The committee may recommend changes to the ULURP process. We need
comprehensive planning, not the haphazard methods currently applied to land use. There
must be further discussion of community give-backs and board priorities in this area.

Nominating Committee
RE: Election of Officers
Members of the Committee joined Linda before the full Board meeting and expressed
dismay about the aftermath of our last election where it appeared that the integrity of
committee members was questioned. In summary, the margin between the two
candidates could not have been affected by one missing vote. Linda stressed that she had
nothing to do with the disputed ballot, and regrets that her name has been impugned. She
clearly stated that she will never chair this committee again. Pat Moore and Mariama
James reviewed their steps in handling the votes. Pat asked the board for constructive
criticism. Many board members expressed their opinions about the situation. Ann
DeFalco said she did not appreciate receiving a call from candidate Marc Ameruso
asking her why she voted as she did. His reply was that he merely called to ask her for an
explanation. Members objected to his actions. Julie Menin stated, “It is not right to
impugn anyone for making their decision to vote.” Michael Connolly objected to
receiving phone calls so close to an election. Marc Ameruso has asked that the following
written statement be added to the Minutes; therefore they are attached as written.

RE: Missing Community Board One Ballot 7/29/2008
When viewing the Community Board One voting ballots on June 25th 2008 at 10:00am
from the election of the previous night, it was discovered that one ballot was missing.
This was reported to and reviewed by the District Manager Noah Pfefferblit immediately,
who then notified board chair Julie Menin and nominating committee chair Linda Belfer.
Who won or lost the election and by how much is not relevant at this time.
The only relevant issue in this matter should be the integrity of the community board
voting process.
I have only said that it simply appears that somewhere along the line a mistake was made.
At no time have I suggested there was any intentional wrong doing.
Those persons and individuals who have directly made such accusations need to
immediately stop making these unfounded allegations.
My primary goal and the goal of this community board and its leadership must be to
assure the board membership and the public that a mistake like this will never happen
again.
12In the next month I intend to submit recommendations to tighten up and improve the
voting process and better define the duties of the nominating committee to avoid future
mistakes.
I implore my fellow board members to submit ideas as well because the board election
two years from now will most likely be contested at all four positions.

Commission to demolish and reconstruct Pier 17, relocate the Tin building and
construct seven new buildings and pavilion structures – Resolution.
 Roger Byrom identified the historical impact of what is before us now,
from the landmarks preservation point of view. There will be a separate
ULURP in the spring. There are probably as many people for this
proposal as there are those against it. As confusing as it may be not to
vote on this proposal together with the ULURP, it is very important that
we consider the parts of General Growth’s proposal that are under LPC’s
jurisdiction.
 Paul Hovitz recommended an amendment regarding GGP’s promise to
provide us with a school.
 Julie Menin suggested that we hold off on such an amendment until we get
to the ULURP phase.
 A National Registry listing carries no legal weight. It’s just an honorary
citation. Anthony Notaro suggested, regarding the Tin building, that in light of the
financial status of GGP, we need to strengthen our position for any
subsequent developer who might succeed GGP.
 Catherine McVay Hughes added that the Tin building must be completed
before moving on to other phases. Sequencing the development process is
important.
 Bob Townley advised us that there is no school involved.
 Julie Menin corrected Bob, assuring him that “the school is on the table.”
 However, GGP’s representative informed us that the size of the school has
not yet been determined.
 Rebecca Skinner reiterated Julie’s statement that the school has been
discussed as an active inclusion to this development.
 The City must tell GGP what the needs for the school will be before they
can describe its design package.
 Diane Lapson feels the “some affordable housing” statement needs to be
strengthened.
 Catherine McVay Hughes gave the square footage of other YMCAs:
McBurney – 67,000 in 2003; Dodge – 40,000 in 2004; and Chinatown –

1) Port Authority Construction - Update
 Discussed Council Member Alan J. Gerson’s recent hearing regarding the WTC’s
construction timetable. The PA has assured us there will be no effect on this
development from the downturn in the economy, therefore he is confident about
the timetables presented.
 It will be very inconvenient for pedestrians if Vesey Street is closed by the PA. It
would impact subway riders as well. The Barclay Street subway entrance will be
more crowded and once the street is closed, the entrance to the E train station,
next to the post office, will be completely closed.
 There will be better signage around the WTC and stepped up enforcement against
illegal vendors.
2) MTA, Fulton Street Transit Center Reconstruction – Update
 A contract will be going out for the MTA Fulton Street Transit Center
reconstruction, for the A/C mezzanine which includes the 4/5 platform.

Community Advisory Committee Meeting at Speaker Silver’s Office, we learned
that floors 15, 14, 13, and 12 have been abated. They’re currently cleaning floors

K) Street Fair Task Force B. Love
Our task force met with Joe Giovanni, Mardi Gras Festival Productions, to discuss
our experience with the 7 fairs held during 2008. Twenty-eight thousand five
hundred dollars were generated in revenue this year, vs. $25,000 last year, netting
an increase of almost $4,000. However, had construction not marred the fair
slated for Whitehall Street, we would have possibly realized an additional
$1,500.00, totaling $30,000.00 annual revenue. We discussed 2 relocation
possibilities from the 4 street fairs scheduled for Maiden Lane. We also discussed
whether or not to continue with Mardi Gras Productions, or solicit bids from other
companies. We also raised the possibility of adding more fairs, such as a holiday
street fair to be held in a park. Noah will investigate whether we can have fairs in
the parks and during holiday periods. Mardi Gras will give us next year’s
proposal for 2009.

III. Committee Reports
A) Executive Committee J. Menin
Chairperson Menin is setting up a Charter Revision Task Force to address
numerous issues, e.g., ULURP, term-limits, etc. She has assigned Jeff Galloway
to chair the task force, which will research rules and regulations regarding
controversial issues.
1) The Extension of Term Limits for New York City Elected Officials –
Resolution.
At yesterday’s Executive Committee Meeting, Jeff Mihok made a
motion to present a resolution opposing the Mayor’s proposal to change term-
limit law. The Chairperson said that she recused herself, but other CB 1 members
had a very lively debate as to whether or not we should proceed with writing a
resolution calling for a referendum. Jeff Mihok’s resolution failed passage (10 –
1) at yesterday’s meeting.
However, with the assistance of Jeff Galloway, Jeff crafted new language to
present the revised resolution to tonight’s full Board.
- Paul Hovitz’s position was that the Community Board should consider the
Mayor’s proposal - sanctioned by Counsel Speaker Quinn, as being illegal in
as much as it does pose a conflict of interest. - Community Board members
and attorneys Michael Connelly and Bill Love discussed the legitimacy of the
Mayor’s act.
- Noel Jefferson further suggested that because CB 1 is a community advisory
board, it should not press political issues that can very well be voted on by the
individual voters or decided by the Court that’s currently considering a ruling
on the matter. Each voter has a right to vote for the party s/he feels is best for
the job and will have the opportunity to do so on election day.
- Bruce Ehrmann countered that if we are not a political organization, then he
doesn’t know what we are.
- Linda Belfer supported our right to comment.
- Ro Sheffe pointed out that the Board is clearly very divided on this issue.
- Julie Menin closed the discussion as it was clearly no less contested than it
was in the Executive Committee Meeting.
4BOARD VOTE: 17 FOR 16 AGAINST 2 ABSTENSIONS
The motion did not carry.
1) Discussion of revising the General Growth Properties resolution - Update.
The Executive Committee discussed GGP’s financial state and the possibility that
the company may file for bankruptcy, LPC’s concern about the inappropriateness
of relocating the 101-yr old Tin Building, as well as their response to the overall
appropriateness of the Seaport redevelopment project. Roger Byrom said that
GGP’s situation has ‘deteriorated badly.’ and suggested that the board needs to
strengthen its position on this redevelopment in the event that another developer
takes over the project.
B) Waterfront Committee R. Townley
1) Governors Island Development – Resolution.
BOARD VOTE: 35 In Favor 0 Opposed 0 Abstained 0 Recused

handicapped access. The traffic pattern will change according to the needs of the
construction project.
2) Battery Park City Authority report
Community Board Advisory Role to the Battery Park City Authority in
Determining Community Amenities – Resolution.
Committee members questioned whether the BPC Authority can or will include
us in the process of choosing operators for public amenities before an RFP has
been approved. Bill Love suggested opening up the Request For Proposal process
to a larger group of candidates. Taxpayers fund many of these organizations, so
we would like to have some say as to who is selected for these public spaces.

BOARD VOTE: Unanimous
B) Chairperson’s Report J. Menin
- CB1’s Planning and Community Infrastructure Committee will consider possible improvements
that can be made by a New York City Charter Revision Commission to be appointed by the Mayor.

- The CB1 Landmarks Committee has had low attendance. Volunteers are needed to serve on

Lower Manhattan Redevelopment. CB1 will testify.

the development up for sale.
C) District Manager’s Report N. Pfefferblit
- Things are not looking good with the latest round of City budget cuts. The City has proposed to

would be impossible for CB1 to cover its personnel costs using City personnel funds.

6:00am on the N, R, and W lines. The MTA has scheduled a public hearing on its service

committees are also having difficulty with quorums and better attendance is needed.
- Beginning with the January meeting, the minutes will no longer be distributed in paper at
meetings. In order to save money and be helpful to the environment, minutes will be distributed
by email unless special requests are received.

COMMUNITY BOARD 1 - MANHATTAN
JANUARY 16, 2007
SOUTH BRIDGE TOWERS
Chairperson, Julie Menin, called the meeting to order at 5:00 PM.
SPECIAL EXECUTIVE SESSION (5 PM - 6 PM)
The Chair commenced this session by explaining the ground rules.
Presentation by the Office of the Mayor regarding the search for human remains around
the World Trade Center site and the question of whether to call in the Joint POW/MIA Account
Command (JPAC) to assist. Ed Skyler, Deputy Major, explained how the City stores and
searches for human remains at and in the vicinity of the WTC site.
 10.19.06: human remains were discovered in a Consolidated Edison manhole
 10.26.06: Mayor announces plan for exploratory search
 Search is a $30,000,000.00 project
 Exploratory project entails subterranean search of 760 manholes belonging to public and
private entities
 Project is an interagency effort headed by Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in New
York City (OCME)
 Conducing the search are OCME forensic anthropologists, archeologists and
investigators.
Other considerations presented were cubic yardage estimates, WTC Haul Road activity,
exploratory phases, and soil stratigraphy. Sifting operations are conducted at 11 Water Street in
Brooklyn that victims’ families and Community Board members toured. Deputy Mayor Skyler
described the sifting operations as a high-tech archaeological operation containing a custom-built
screening system.Community Board Factual Questions and Comments
Q: In light of Dr. Adams’ experience with JPAC, why did the City reject JPAC’s
involvement at no cost to the City?
A. Where the City can do the job itself, it would not be fair to drain JPAC’s resources.
C: Given that the City’s forensic expertise exceeds JPAC’s, the City won’t get a better
operation than it will with resources and agencies currently involved.
C: Public Comments and Questions
Q: Why not have more experts working on the operation by including JPAC?
A: JPAC does not have the resources to help right now.
Q: Is there a written protocol for the operation? How is the search conducted? How are
decisions made?
Comments:
 The City failed us over the last five years
 The current approach is the result of pressure from the families and the community
 There is a double standard with regard to Ground Zero -- an outside agency is involved in
the Sean Bell murder
 Deputy Mayor Skyler is providing misinformation: in an October 20th letter to the mayor,
JPAC stated that the Defense Department is willing to bring JPAC to the operation.
(Copies of the same were provided to the Community Board.) Skyler is determined that
JPAC is not available
Further Discussion with the Community Board Generated the Following Comments
 Demands for JPAC emotionally driven and are a major way of getting back at the City.
 Resistance by City generates mistrust.
 No evidence of harm in having JPAC.
 9.11 was an act of war and the WTC site the battleground. There are 1,200 people MIA,
and JPAC’s mission is to find those MIA. JPAC should do in NYC what it did in
Vietnam.
 Why ask a military entity to drain its resources doing something we can do?

MANHATTAN COMMUNITY BOARD #1
HELD
JULY 31, 2007
THE NEW YORK LAW SCHOOL
The Chairperson, Julie Menin, called the meeting to order.
Public Session:
Sayar Lonial, Office of NYC Council Member Alan J. Gerson - Announced
the following Resolutions presented to City Council (1) Billboards and signs should
reflect a residential neighborhood rather than the manufacturing district as is currently
zoned; (2) We would like sufficient open space assurance, in the City, before City
Planning certifies more residential development throughout the City; (3) The same
assurance is being requested in regards to school space; and (4) A new Use Group will be
created to oversee regulations as they pertain to Telecom Hotels.
Pursuant to Governor Spitzer “Grab Bar” Bill signature, City Council will grant
property tax rebates to owners, upon request, for installing grab bars.
Thanks to Congressman Weiner’s Office that federal funds were cleared to
facilitate Governor’s Island ferry service. Councilmember Gerson encourages us to all to
visit the Island and weigh our comments into: www.Parkatthecenteroftheworld.org.
Also, forward comments to Council Member Gerson’s Office for input inclusion in the
“Open Space Selection” process in early September.
Assembly Member Deborah Glick – While studying Mayor’s Congestion
Mitigation Plan, disagrees with the exemption of the black cars as they only serve a
wealthy few, unlike taxicabs, which should be exempt as they provide transportation
predominantly for the middle-class populous. Stresses the need to address abuse as in the
misuse of permits and monitor the large number of permanent parking permits. Those
now penalizing the existing congestion-related regulations, i.e., “blocking the box”
should be subjected to fines. The passing of this plan will necessitate revamping our
mass transit system to accommodate the additional commuters.
It is very important that the Pier 26 estuary be responsive to the community needs,
i.e., a restaurant doesn’t have to be the size of a banquet hall.DHCR’s recent Determination closes the “Unique And Peculiar” loophole
landlords formerly used when buying out of the Mitchell Lama Program. This victory
favors maintaining affordable housing. The loopholes “as of right” condition permitted
landlords to apply market rate rents to apartments upon exiting the Mitchell Lama
Program.
The proposed DOE formula, requesting additional funding to reduce class size, is
questionable. Future discussions with Dep. Mayor Dennis Walcott will cover (1)
parochial schools closing and consolidation in and around Lower Manhattan; and (2) the
possibility of retrofitting buildings, in a cost efficient manner, to reduce overcrowding of
Lower Manhattan schools.
Assembly passed the Marriage Equality Bill, 85 – 61.
NY State Senator Martin Connor – Concurs with many of Assemblywoman
Glick’s Congestion Pricing points, but would add flexible pricing plans. Views the
Mayor’s “hidden catches,” i.e., $8.00 for residents leaving the congestion zone; and
$115.00 fine for late payment, as unreasonable and unfair to the commuters. Moreover,
environmentalists should conduct Environmental Impact Statement, as is required for any
traffic plan, before proceeding. Adjusted prices for commuters would possibly reduce
street traffic, but believes the Mayor’s proposed payment initiative is questionable.
Advocates that low-emission and hybrid cars should pay less than larger gas guzzling
vehicles. A more scientific approach to this proposal must be implemented. When the
Senate reconvenes in September, among the issues the Commission will address include:
(1) Campaign Finance and (2) healthy schools.
Gregory Brender - Office of NYC B.P. Scott Stringer - Supports the Quality of
Life and Affordable Housing Committee Resolution. BPO’s Community Labor Task
Force finds common ground between community groups and labor, on issues regarding:
(1) recruiting union groups; and (2) insuring safety and labor. Over 80% of last year’s
construction accidents occurred on non-union sites. CB 1 is experiencing many issues
regarding demolition wherein major construction projects we’re facing are asbestos
buildings. Many of those buildings impacted by the WTC construction are ones for
which we need to insure that workers are decently compensated and have appropriate
training.
In September, Manhattan Neighborhood Network, MNN, will air our June
Meeting on Time Warner, Ch. 34.
October 20th, B.P. Stringer will host a Town Hall Meeting focusing on education
issues and how parents can work within the school system. B.P. Stringer appointed
Patrick Sullivan, PTA Member and leader, to the Panel For Educational Policy. G.
Brender’s contact is 212- 669- 8774 and gbrender@bp.org.Erin Drinkwater - Office of Congressman J. Nadler – Congressman Nadler
appreciates the passage of the 9/11 Commission Bill he introduced years ago, requiring
100% maritime cargo scanning aimed to keep our ports safe and protect America.
HHS Appropriation Bill passed, allocating $5M to the 9/11 Health Plan.
Committed to working with 333 Rector Place tenants and representatives. Also
supports the Pier 40 Task Force for whose recommendations he is promoting.
John Ost - Board of Directors Southbridge Towers - “No Permit Parking
Zone” resolution is highlights safety issues between Gold and Pearl Streets during
construction. The 75-story structure being constructed between Spruce and Beekman
Street creates a massive traffic jam and the site also impacts the ambulances at Beekman
Hospital as well as the fire trucks operating from the Beekman Street Fire House.
Joey Longo – Commerce Bank – Announced Grand Opening at 258 B’Way,
Thursday, August 2, 2007. This two-times award-winning community bank’s, operating

PM; and on Sunday from 11: 00 AM – 4:00 PM, 352 days a year.
John Ricker – Office of Comptroller William Thompson - Supports the
Mayor’s PLAN 2030 and Congestion Pricing, but as does Senator Connor, has
suggestions he’d like to see implemented: (1) more capital projects; and (2) service
improvements, including a guaranteed maintenance effort in place should precede the
implementation of congestion pricing. Comptroller Thompson pledges to continue the
fight with the Rent Guidelines Board reasonable rents.
Bob Townley thanked Comptroller Thompson’s Office for assisting in the timely
navigation of the Community Center contract’s final stage approval.
Deborah Morris - Downtown Alliance – Departing post for graduate school.

IN THE MINUTES, PLEASE CONTACT THE CB 1 OFFICE AT 212 442-5050.
A) West Street Task Force R. Townley
The Mayor’s Traffic Congestion Pricing will continue to be discussed. School
safety site major accomplishments are: (1) Crosswalks now exist underneath the
Chambers Street Bridge; and (2) The Governor’s ruling not to institute turning lanes on
Warren Street. Giant electronic signs over West Street are not only useless, but could
become hazardous for pedestrians and school children crossing West Street.MTA made an egregious mistake by removing the North End stop sign.
Changing the light pattern on West Street is a goal, but most of the resolution is
demanding enforcement of current laws, i.e., speed limit, 35 miles per hour or less.

Board One Member, Ruth Ohman.
 Hearings following the August 18th seven-alarm fatal fire at130 Liberty Street
have addressed numerous concerns, dating back to the Town Hall Meeting,
sponsored by CB 1 and the LMDC two years ago. (CB 1 Members adamantly
opposed the LMDC’s decision to hire the John Galt Corp. for the demolition of
130 Liberty Street.) It was argued that Harold Greenberg’s firm, Safeway
Environmental, which according to press reports may have mafia links, actually
controlled the John Galt Corporation.
 Today, at Speaker Sheldon Silver’s Office, LMDC Chair, Avi Schick, promised
to look into the method to be implemented on the Fiterman Hall deconstruction.
Resealing 130 Liberty St. will commence in 3 weeks. It was reported, “ALL
agencies involved reached a deal.”

funds that had to be returned to the City treasury when they were not used in the

begun implementation of an arts program designed to enhance the appearance of
construction sites in Lower Manhattan. The resulting 3 installation proposals
follow:
“Fulton Fence” - to be located on Fulton Street, between B’way and Nassau
Street. Colored scrim mesh fencing will not only protect the area from dust, but
will also provide night lighting.
“Concrete Jungle” – consisting of a stenciled zebra-like painted pattern on the
existing concrete barrier will run along B’way, from Ann Street to John Street,
adjacent to the Fulton Street transit center.
“Best Pedestrian Route” – a protective sidewalk shed, constructed from
plexiglass. aluminum and plywood will have a laser cut design and will light the
night as it also offers an attractive alternative to a typical shed. This structure will
be located on Jay Street and B’way.All installations, being sponsored by the Downtown Alliance, are planned for
installation during the first 2 weeks of October and will remain for 6 months.
In response to Laura Braddock’s comments, we were subsequently assured of its
safety and informed that 2 structural engineers will inspect the aluminum mesh
shed before installation to assure its safety.

RE: New York Department of Sanitation, Manhattan 1/3/5 Garage Complex,
Located at Spring Street – Report.
The Sanitation Department plans to move its district stations for CB’s 1, 2, and 5
to the Canal Street Area, where a total estimated 30,000 gallons of combustible
fluid would be stored near the opening of the Holland Tunnel. Each garbage
truck’s sound and pollution, according to an EIS, is equivalent to the combined
sound and pollution of 85 cars. The concerted protests from CB 1 and CB 2
elicited the support of several other groups, including UPS, Trinity Church and
others who also oppose the proposal. We anticipate a reversal of this proposed
ULURP action and DSNY has resumed its search for a more suitable location for
this facility.

Resolution unanimously adopted.
RE: Battery Park City Library Design - Report
After many years of diligent work, BPC will finally get its long-promised library
in February 2008. Yet, the actual build-out will take 18 additional months. A
significant sum to fund this library is being donated by Goldman Sachs, in
connection with their agreement to provide a public amenity in connection with
development of Site 26 in BPC. Their donation will greatly contribute to the
build-out efforts. Councilmember Alan Gerson will also contribute capital funds
to the BPC Library. The library’s glass façade will show the books from the
exterior, reflecting a library’s true character. Its approximately10,000 sq. ft. of
space, larger than the New Amsterdam Library, will have a balcony, aprogramming area, and an outside space. The library will also provide a separate
reading area for adults. Effective today, the BPC Library will accept donations!
RE: 2B Bad News and Good News - Report
The School Construction Authority may want Site 2B delivered to them sooner
than expected, by next Summer, to be able to open the BPC school by 2010.
However, site 2B must be vacated of its current tenants, and the relocation of
these uses may cause impacts elsewhere, including the nearby dog run.
Gateway Plaza houses 1,700 units in BPC. Agreements affecting lease increases
expire in 2009. Various tenants within BPC formed a grass-roots organization
that met with Councilmember Alan Gerson. In total, there were 25 people present
to discuss affordability. Rising property values are forcing many long- term
residents out of their homes. Everyone agreed it is vitally important to retain
housing affordability.
F) WTC Redevelopment Committee C. McVay Hughes
RE: Silverstein Properties World Trade Center Towers 4, 3 and 2 Development
Update – Report
We appreciate Silverstein Properties for hosting our meeting.
The respective towers, # 4, 3 and 2, will be located at: 150, 175 and
200 Greenwich Street. Although it will become a through Street, looking into the
Memorial, it’s doubtful that Cortland Street will be open to vehicular traffic. The
ground’s elevation change will be taken into consideration when building. Machi,
DeShirk and Forrester are designing the retail floors: above and below ground.
RE: 130 Liberty Street – Resolution
Chairperson Julie Menin’s June 7, 2007 appointment to the LMDC Board was
much too late to have brought about additional oversight on 130 Liberty Street.
We recently learned of another incident where a worker fell 40 feet from and was
severely injured at the building under Bovis Lend Lease’s oversight.
Additionally, in 2006, a smaller fire than the one on August 18th occurred. The
Board was not advised.
A friendly amendment was adopted, pertaining to the March 8, 2007 school cell
phone ban. Individual schools should fashion their own cell phone policies. The
Board of Education is encouraged to place a moratorium on the ban.
Another friendly amendment was also adopted, requesting that all contracts
appear online. In addition to tomorrow’s decontamination resumption, (130
Liberty Street), 2 staircases will also be built, in 2 different locations, to increase
the safety measures while deconstruction work resumes. Bovis Lend Lease willreseal the building, beginning on the first floor. This contractor will also be
responsible for building the staircases. Both procedures are expected to begin
tomorrow, as it was reported that the respective agencies are satisfied with the
materials to be used for resealing.
Allan Tannenbaum suggested, and it was agreed upon, that signage outside the
work site indicate, daily, the number of days the site has been accident-free, as
appears to be standard practice at many other construction sites. Additionally, a
strong vetting process for identifying proficient construction workers should be
implemented.
Chairperson Julie Menin stated there needs to be a method whereby agencies will
be required to respond to Community Board resolutions and communications
within a timely basis and not ignored. In 2005, CB 1 raised strong objections, on
several levels, to the hiring of John Galt. The DA is now investigating the
company. Julie stated that had prescient resolutions passed by CB 1 been adhered
to, the fire and subsequent fatalities may have been prevented. We would like for
the City Charter to be revised to ensure that forthwith a mechanism is set up,
whereby LMDC and other agencies must respond to CB 1’s resolutions and other
correspondences in a formalized manner as opposed to being ignored.
A roll call vote unanimously adopted this resolution.

MANHATTAN COMMUNITY BOARD # 1
OCTOBER 16, 2007
SOUTHBRIDGE TOWERS
90 BEEKMAN STREET COMMUNITY ROOM
The Chairperson, Julie Menin, called the meeting to order.
Public Session:
Council Member Alan J. Gerson – Reported the following works in progress:
 Diligent oversight in the aftermath of the Deutsche Bank fire. At the request of
the Mayor and the Governor, who are cooperating with him, he has postponed the
planned City Council Oversight Hearing on safeguards going forward to prevent a
hazardous recurrence at 130 Liberty Street. Structural, building and
environmental safeguards should be in place at the time of the Hearing, before
work resumes. Recommendations for emergency notification need to be in place
as well, followed by funding recommendations.
 The Port Authority is working at Ground Zero to meet its deadline. However, the
ill effects resulting from 24/7 pile driving, etc. is not acceptable and he is meeting
with the Port Authority to modify work schedules and impacts. Julie Menin said
she will call Tony Shorris, Exec. Dir., PANYNJ, to follow-up on requesting their
cooperation.
 On 11/19, a community meeting will be held at Pace University, to discuss the
Fulton Street Reconstruction project parameters. All should attend.
 Sponsored capital funding through the City Council to further health research, and
awarded a small block of money to the lead lab, NYU Medical Research Library
– the only one tracking and focusing on the overall epidemiology of the toxins
emitted from 9/11 attacks. Hopes that LMDC will match this monetary award to
further assist the library.
 The Councilman is investigating who hired the John Galt Company and why.
Believes the investigatory process will answer these questions. Julie met with the
D.A. and is confident that his office is looking at how the LMDC made their
decision to hire John Galt. Preserving affordable housing as it relates to Gateway Plaza is a priority, as in
2009 rent stabilization protection will expire there. He is reminding the City and
the HPD Commissioner Shaun Donovan that if we lose Gateway’s stabilized
apartments, we’ll lose more than we can ever create again.
 The ULURP application for 50 West Street is being considered. Is actively
pursuing an affordable housing linkage with the application. It will remain a
threshold condition, although land use negotiations have legal precedents that
limit linkage.
 Congestion pricing and traffic are high on the City’s policy agenda. Town Halls
are avenues for community input at which traffic mitigation priorities can be
expressed.
 Tweaking of the bus management layover plan is in dire need and must include
every community.
 The Councilman is co-sponsoring a politically inspired Halloween Party on
October 25th. All are invited to the Chinatown Grand Harmony Restaurant, at
7:00 PM.
Bruce Ehrmann praised Council Member Gerson’s efforts and successes in funding
numerous local arts groups.
Paul Goldstein – The Office of Assemblyman Sheldon Silver – Announced
that talks regarding commuter and tour buses are progressing. The mission of getting
buses off busy streets in such a congested neighborhood will require creating a
parking garage to accommodate 175 buses. This garage could occupy one wing of
the existing 2000 car Battery Tunnel Garage.
Assembly Member Silver is recruiting local residents to sign up to participate in a
“Community Notification Plan For Lower Manhattan.” Moreover, he is also
working with the City’s Office of Emergency Management (OEM) and LMDC
officials to assure accurate and timely updates from OEM to local residents and
businesses – in the event of local emergencies. Those interested are encouraged to
sign up and return the “Lower Manhattan Community Notification Plan” card to
Assemblyman Silver.
Assemblyman Silver provided strong leadership in our ongoing efforts to convert
the Battery Park City ball fields to artificial turf in order to allow more children
access. Because the ball fields are oftentimes closed while natural grass is being
replaced following repeated use, children are not getting maximum use of the ball
fields. Therefore, Assemblyman Silver argued that artificial turf would not only
extend the ball field’s availability, it would also best safely serve the maximum
number of local children. The dissenting BPC Authority Chairman, James Gill, will
be heavily influenced by the vote of the task force that has been formed, although the
Authority will make the final decision. The next meeting is scheduled for February
2008.Erin Drinkwater – Office of Congressman Jerrold Nadler – Reported that she
will present details on the 9/11 Health Bill at next month’s Lower Manhattan
Redevelopment Committee Meeting. This bill was introduced by Reps. Maloney,
Nadler, and Fossella in support of health care compensation for 9/11 responders.
This bi-partisan legislation will address the health impacts of the 9/11 attacks,
resulting in the need for further research to develop appropriate medical and treatment
protocols.
Congressman Nadler is supporting the Employment Non Discrimination Act
(ENDA), which would prohibit discrimination against employees on the basis of
sexual orientation and gender expression in the workplace. However, as only one
version of the bill stipulates both protections, Congressman Nadler will vote for the
one that offers both.”.
Matt Viggiano – The Office of New York Senator Martin Connor - Reported
that Senator Connor is actively working on the Pier 40 development. Senator
Connor convened a meeting on October 10th, attended by local elected officials,
including Senator Duane, Assembly Members Glick and Gottfried and representatives
from Congressman Nadler’s Office and Council Member Quinn—all of whom feel
strongly about the need to develop strategies to shape development of the Pier 40
project. Both current proposals–as presented by the Related Companies Plan and the
Camp Group/People’s Pier Plan–lack luster.
In the coming week, Congressman Nadler and Borough President Stringer will
meet with the new Hudson River Park Trust Chair, Diana Taylor and HRPT President
Connie Fishman to further discuss the future of Pier 40.
Southbridge Parent’s And Youth Association received a $2,000.00 grant from the
Senator. The group was rewarded for coming together for the betterment of the South
Street Seaport Area children and their families.
Bess Matassa – The Office of Assembly Member Deborah J. Glick – Brought
registration forms for the Greenwich Village Girls’ Basketball League for amateurs
and professionals, throughout the boroughs, ranging from 9-14 years old. Deadline
is Oct. 20th.
Supports Council Member Mendez’s initiative on Intro 340, which would crack
down on phony demolitions by requiring landlords who are filing for demolitions and
could potentially evict rent stabilized and controlled tenants to first notify local
elected officials and community boards before taking steps to evict tenants with what
would amount to phony demolitions.
Urged the NYPD to shun the aggressive and racially motivated practices of the
Giuliani administration and to undertake a thorough review of the mishandling of the
racially motivated attacks against members of the Borough of Manhattan Community
College’s (BMCC) basketball team near City Hall. It is inexcusable that the NYPD is
unwilling to agree that these incidents do indeed meet the threshold of a racial attack
and should be treated as a biased hate crime against a class of people, not merely
reported that racial epithets were yelled at the group of African American students
and their athletic coach, who was also beaten.Gregory Brender – Office of NYC B.P. Scott Stringer – Announced a proposal
for Borough-wide support of CD 9’s contextual rezoning proposal.
Parents and all those interested in our children’s education are urged to attend
Borough President Stringer’s Education Conference–to be held on Saturday, October
20th at 8:30 AM, at the New School. Keynote speakers will address important issues
and workshops will be offered on finding the right school and roadmap to college,
fundraising for schools, etc.
It would empower community boards to mandate that the DOB notify the
community board and local elected officials when there is a planned demolition that
could affect local residents.
John Ricker – The Office of NYC Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. -
Announced Comptroller Thompson’s 15-year study spanning the period from 1990 –
2005, highlighting the increasing health disparities among socio-economic levels.
Lower income families living in NYC have shown a much broader rate of heart
disease, cancer and diabetes. Economic and social conditions are contributors to
health discrepancies, hospitalization, and mortality rates. Comptroller Thompson
asserts that primary and preventive care saves lives and thus is key to reducing these
broadening disparities.
High School violence has increased. Moreover, the Department of Education
(DOE) has failed in its obligation to properly record and report incidents – as is
required by the state, Comptroller Thompson uncovered in a recent audit. The
flawed reporting system prohibits the parents, public and government officials from
assessing a school’s safety. More information can be found on the Comptroller’s
Website, www.comptroller.nyc.gov.
Comptroller Thompson urges anyone who has knowledge of governmental waste,
fraud, or mismanagement within NYC, to please report it.
Foreclosures resulting not only from sub-prime or secondary mortgages, but other
factors as well, have reached a high level. Comptroller Thompson’s Foreclosure
Prevention Helpline, 212-669-4600, will direct calls seeking assistance in this area to
the appropriate financial representative who can try to help thwart foreclosure.
Florence Craddock –Resident is fed up with the current physical conditions in
the area around Fulton Street and the South Street Seaport. Missing curb cuts and
broken cobblestones create hazardous conditions for wheelchair bound and walker-
assisted residents. Seniors need access to the park, etc.
Ryan Martinez - The Battle for Manhattan Rep.– Announced an athletic
competition in 2008 between the East and West Sides of NYC. A series of
recreational activities that promote goodwill and the spirit of NYC will celebrate its
diverse communities. For additional information, go to:
www.Battleformanhattan.com, or email ryan@and-entertainment.com. Events will
run from April 1st to April 15th, 2008. Registration begins in November.Business Session:
The minutes of the September 18th monthly meeting were adopted as presented.
Chairperson’s Report:
Julie Menin reported on the following issues:
 Tribeca North rezoning will include a very important inclusionary affordable
housing component, with use groups ensuring that Tribeca North retains its
contextual character.
 In response to General Growth Properties’ interest in CB1’s concern for an East
Side community center, Julie and John Fratta met with the company’s corporate
representatives. General Growth Properties is planning to meet with the 92nd
Street YMCA in January to discuss partnering with them to develop a feasibility
study for the Seaport Area. Such a plan and/or feasibility study would in no way
guarantee a CB1 endorsement for any development proposed by General Growth.
This will be discussed at an upcoming Seaport Committee meeting. All interested
members and the public are urged to attend.
 Avi Schick recently discussed ideas about the future development of Greenwich
South and the sale of air rights around the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel. We shall
study this issue in our Financial District and Planning Committees.
 Forthcoming LMDC community enhancement grants will indeed be welcome.
The results are expected as early as November.
 Governor Spitzer and Speaker Silver announced at a recent press conference that
NCR, a Fortune 400 company, will relocate more than 200 employees from Ohio
to 7 WTC. Larry Silverstein announced that nearly three-quarters of 7 WTC has
already been leased.
 Still untangling the kinks of the August 18th Deutsche Bank Fire. The failure to
notify local residents was very disturbing to CB 1 and our community. We’ve
requested LMDC to discuss, face-to-face, a comprehensive notification plan this
month with CB 1. LMDC is considering offering CB 1 a grant to handle a
notification piece. However, if this plan were implemented, the state would have
to stipulate, in writing, that CB 1 would not bear sole responsibility.
 M.B.P. Scott Stringer and CB 1 echo the local elected officials’ sentiments
opposing the Pier 40 proposals.
District Manager’s Report - N. Pfefferblit:
 Attended a meeting to review changes in procedures for street activities. Changes
will be made in the handling of street fairs and other street activities, which have
been moved to a new Office of Citywide Coordination.
 Budget consultations were held and were useful.
 Ninety Broad St. space will become available for a not-for-profit organization, at
a deeply discounted rate for the next 5 years.
 We welcome Basha Estroff, Urban Fellow, to CB 1. Basha will work closely
with Michael Levine on land use issues.
 Judy Norinsky is the new Community Liaison for CB 1.
 Congratulations to Liz Berger, former CB 1 Member and local resident, in her
new position as President for the Downtown Alliance. Thanks to Noel E. Jefferson for a great job on the Minutes and submitting them
accurately and within a timely basis.
Treasurer’s Report – J. Kopel:
 Budget increased from $186k - $199K in personnel services (D.C. 37’s increases)
and incorporating Judy’s salary for one week.
Committee Reports:
A) Executive Committee:
 Report on Lower Manhattan demographic data revealed that we’re the fastest
growing community in the City.
 In support of Borough President Stringer's proposal for a West Harlem Special
District surrounding the Columbia University expansion plan. Julie will represent
CB 1 through her vote at Thursday’s Borough Board Meeting.
Roll call: 37 In Favor 0 Opposed 0 Abstained 0 Recused
 Capital and Expense Budget Requests for FY 2009 – Resolution.
o The Middle School has been a long-time priority. Because the
Department of Education is no longer building Middle Schools, wording
now reflects K-8.
o Julie Nadel is confident that Piers 25 and 26 will be funded, considering
the fundraising abilities of Diana Taylor, H.R.P.T.’s new Chairperson.
o Bob Townley informed us that the “Downtown Community Center” has
copyright protection, therefore legally we need to refer to it as such; and
not as the Manhattan Youth Center.
Roll call: 37 In Favor 0 Opposed 0 Abstained 0 Recused
NOTE: IF YOU WISH TO RECEIVE A COPY OF A RESOLUTION SUMMARIZED

B) WTC Redevelopment Committee - C. McVay Hughes
Port of Authority of New York and New Jersey, Quarterly Construction
Update:
 PA is working very hard to construct 6-ft. walls for Towers 3 and 4.
 N/R subway stations won’t be open until Towers 3 and 4 are completed. This
area will be used for dropping off materials and making deliveries.
 Liberty Park, next to Tower 5, is still under design.
 The Performing Arts Center location won’t be available for another 4 years at
which time it is expected that the site will become available to begin constructing
the center.WTC Health Coordinator for the City of New York - Report
 A portion of the funds allocated to address WTC issues has been earmarked to the
“Three Centers of Excellence:” 1. FDNY; 2. Mt. Sinai; and 3. Bellvue Hospitals.
Another portion will be dedicated to outreach for the people who live and work in
the area. For additional information, please go to NYC.gov/healthinfo.com.
 A pediatric health initiative is being conducted.
C) Financial District Committee R. Sheffe
Landmarks Committee R. Byrom
Waterfront Committee J. Nadel
Proposed Development of the Battery Maritime Building Presentation -
Report:
 On October 3rd, EDC and the developer attended a joint meeting regarding
proposed plans, but will return with revisions. The proposals were presented.
Because of many questionable issues surrounding the public access versus private
events, we requested clarity. We do know that Cipriani plans on opening a
restaurant/bar. The “Great Hall” is a 9,000 sq. ft. open space on the 2nd floor; 3
floors of hotel space are to include a restaurant and other amenities. Roger, Chair
of the Landmarks Committee will present the details to his committee on
Tuesday, although it is unlikely the committee members will opine on this very
important building until a following meeting.
 A tour of the building by boat will be arranged for interested CB1 members.
 Discussions will continue at the Landmarks Meeting on November 8th. Bear in
mind that the S.I. Ferry Terminal and this building were built to resemble each
other. However, this is not the case with the present ferry building.
D) Landmarks Committee: R. Byrom
RE: 46 Laight Street, LPC application for restoration of front façade with
modifications and rebuilding of rear facade and construction of two story
addition.
Resolution: Unanimously approved.
RE: 60 Hudson Street, LPC application for installation of security bollards around the
doors as well as inside the building. WHO SAID THIS? If the building is safe,
why are bollards needed? Landmarks committee feels that “if it is an unsafe
building,” the 6 exterior bollards will improve its safety.
Resolution: Unanimously approved.
RE: 345 Greenwich Street, LPC application for replacement of windows.
Resolution: Unanimously approved.RE: 44 Lispenard Street, LPC application for 2 story rooftop addition. This will block
another 2-story roof condition.
Resolution. 36 In Favor 1 Opposed.
RE: 14 Wall Street, LPC application for ground floor storefront, signage and entry
alterations. Because of security, entrance designations have been instituted.
Resolution: Unanimously approved.
RE: Building 550, Governors Island, minor exterior alterations to accommodate
school use of former medical building, not in the master plan. They’re converting
a parking lot into a brick terrace with a garden. Will install window louvers to
accommodate air conditioners. We approve of the design.
Resolution: Unanimously approved.
RE: 213 Pearl Street, request for LPC designation. Rockrose’s sale of this building
complicates resolution inasmuch as the previous owner’s constraints no longer
apply. However, we’re attempting to attain cultural landmark status, which would
limit the current owner’s design plan.
Resolution: Unanimously approved.
RE: Landmarks Preservation Commission Procedures.
CB 7 suggested that community board resolutions should be distributed to staff
and the Commissioners before the Commission votes on it, as is stated in the
Charter.
Resolution: Unanimously approved.
RE: Battery Maritime Building Proposed Development Plan.
Because of the complicated modifications and substantial additions to this
Landmark building, the Landmarks Preservation Commission has agreed to hold
open public comment until a later date in December; therefore CB 1 will issue a
substantive resolution after further consideration.
Resolution: Unanimously approved.
E) Seaport/Civic Center Committees P. Hovitz
RE: DeLury Square Park Design Proposal.
Expansion and reconstruction will enhance the open space for this park located at
Gold and Fulton Streets. The Dep’t of Parks and Recreation will return to CB 1
with a final site plan, operating schedule and security plan.Resolution: 33 In Favor 2 opposed.
RE: Collect Pond Park, (Worth/Lafayette and Broadway) Design Proposal.
Reconstruction will enhance and expand the open space for residents, visitors and
local workers. The Dep’t of Parks and Recreation will return to CB 1 with a final
site plan that includes bench and lighting locations, trash receptacles, operating
schedule and security plan. Both drafts appear to be good and both parks are
scheduled to close at dusk. They each will have a small waterfall and senior
accessibilities. However, Southbridge’s Board of Directors has to agree on the
sale of a portion of its property to the Department of Parks and Recreation for the
plan to go forward.
CB 1 Members raised objections to the park proposals, and followed with a
proposal to table the motion, until the NYPD can respond at our next meeting.
The Board rejected this motion and then voted on the resolution.
Resolution: 33 In Favor 2 opposed
Paul Hovitz considered a friendly amendment in response to the objections.
The appropriate CB1 Committees will meet with NYPD to discuss these security
concerns.
Friends of City Hall Park – Update:
We have concerns pertaining to promises rendered by the City regarding City Hall
Park, but never fulfilled. We promise to follow up and report in the near future.
Proposed Improvements to Chatham Square and Park Row – Mitigation
Recommend by Final Environmental Impact Statement for One Police Plaza
Security Plan – Report:
The inadequate EIS does not allow for the opportunity to implement changes.
We’ve asked what traffic mitigations plans they have. They couldn’t answer,
other than to say, “We’ll have to get back to you.” Additionally, other issues
under Brooklyn Bridge and on Pearl Street still exist.
F) Waterfront Committee J. Nadel
East River Waterfront Plan – Report:
Information will be forthcoming next week. There’s nothing to report pertaining
to Governor's Island, except that a design team has yet to be selected.
Hudson River Park – Report: M. Ameruso
Pier 40 committee rejected 2 proposals, including the one the HRPT favors. The
Pier 40 Partnership, a coalition of parents, is trying to raise funds for a different
approach. On May 3rd, a public hearing drew 1,500 attendees, most of whom
opposed the existing plans.G) Planning and Community
Infrastructure Committee R. Landman
Special sub-district for the C6-9 Greenwich Street South Area – Report:
Plans are in progress to develop a Master Plan for future development in the C6-9
Area. It will include identification of an affordable housing component within
this proposed development.
H) Tribeca Committee A. Neale
Tribeca North Rezoning – Rezoning Proposal in Tribeca’s Mixed-Use
District – Report:.
We have for a long time collaborated with M.B.P. Scott Stringer, Council
Member Gerson and CB 3 to encourage developers to provide affordable housing
in vacant areas we’ve collectively identified in Lower Manhattan. Developers are
allotted a 30% FAR increase for providing an affordable housing allotment of
20%. They may chose to take advantage if this program, although they are not
legally bound do so,
We wish to replace the CB 1 Tribeca North rezoning resolution adopted in 2006
with new stipulations for height, set-back and FAR provisions.
Resolution: 35 In Favor 5 Opposed.
Tribeca North Rezoning, discussion of uses – Report:
We’re working with the City Planning Commission to develop a use-group plan
for the areas to be rezoned in Tribeca North.
56 Leonard Street – Report:
The developer of the New York Law School site will build a 57-story, non-
contextual, as-of-right building. In exchange, we’re hoping for a Tribeca
community enhancement such as assistance with our estuarium proposal. We
admit to having been remiss in not requesting landmark status when we had the
opportunity.
Canal Area Transportation Study, Track II – Report:
Our goal is to change parking regulations as residential development proceeds.
Broadway Bus Bulbs – Report:
Lax enforcement is resulting in some worsening of existing traffic problems.
RE: 349 Broadway, transfer of liquor license from MHA Entertainment Corp
d/b/a Peppers to Wonderworks d/b/a Eros., Recommendation to oppose.
Resolution: Unanimous approval.RE: DEKK 134, located on Reade Street, applied for a liquor license for 134
Reade Street Associates. Agreed to move sidewalk furniture.
Resolution: Unanimous approval.
RE: 249 West Broadway, application for renewal of unenclosed sidewalk café
for Anotheroom, Inc.
Resolution: Unanimous approval.
RE: 355 Greenwich Street, application for renewal of unenclosed sidewalk
café for Harrison Greenwich, LLCU
Resolution: Unanimous approval.
I) Battery Park City Committee J. Galloway
Site 2B – Report:
The relocation of Site 2B’s current uses could affect the BPC community,
including the West Thames Street Dog Run. Displacement will probably occur in
the summer, but problems would more likely occur if they have to work faster.
Local bus shelters are also affected by rerouted buses while 9A is being worked
on. We discussed the possibility of using some of the BPC Authority surplus to
alleviate affordable housing strains within the community as a whole, not just
BPC.
J) Quality of Life Committee/Affordable Housing – Report: P. Moore
LMCCC is the first item on this and every monthly meeting. It’s important to
attend this committee meeting, especially if you have an issue regarding quality of
life situations. Its representatives will answer your concerns.
RE: Report on Construction Projects in Lower Manhattan
K) Youth & Education Committee/ P. Hovitz
New School Task Force R. Skinner
Beekman Street School – Report.
Speaker Silver, the Department of Education and Forest City Ratner have assured
us that the Beekman School is on schedule to open 9/09.
Millennium High School Gymnasium – Report:
The fate of the Millennium H.S. gym lies with the upcoming LMDC Grants.
PS 234, Walkway – Report:
Council Member Gerson is working closely with us to find financial sponsorship.PS 89 School capacity and after school programs – Report:
Capacity remains virtually the same as last year, to the best of our knowledge.
However, the after school programs certainly need additional funding. Manhattan
Youth is seeking more funding as the programs are full and in need.
Middle school selection process – Report:
The Board of Education delayed submissions by more than a month, resulting in
applications that won’t be submitted until perhaps mid February 2008. We are
concerned that parents won’t be notified until June. This creates the arduous task
of finding a school for their children so late in the year. We shall draft a letter
requesting that DOE not change the submission date and expressing our
dissatisfaction with the decision delay.
Bob Townley reported on an underestimated “explosion of teens,” within BPC,
Tribeca and the Financial District. That there are more toddlers in zip code 10013
is a misnomer. The teen population, 12-16/18 year olds, outnumbers the toddler
population. Moreover, within the past 5 years, there have been 3 teen suicides
within this concentrated zip code. The absence of a teen infrastructure is
tantamount to teen chaos. We must face this serious issue before it gets out of
control. Catherine McVay Hughes suggested writing a resolution on this matter.
Rebecca Skinner added that peer, after-school and weekend activities could help

C. Youth & Education Committee/New School Task Force - Reports P. Hovitz
R. Skinner

(DYCD), raised questions pertaining to the appropriation of funding for
programs based within CB1.
 Although all kids deserve funding, CB 1 would like assurance of equitable
financial distribution. The committee asked to be apprised of the DYCD funds serving the area and
that there be a minimum reestablished to ensure fair allocation for all
community boards, particularly CB 1.
 Moreover, the committee requested that CB 1 be added to DYCD’s mailing
list whereby we’ll receive all Requests For Proposals.
. Security School Safety - Report
 Teenagers and high school kids, particularly on Fulton Street, but also in the
surrounding area, occasionally causing disturbances.
 Sergeant Kott, from the 1st Precinct, met with and advised the committee that
from 1:30 PM– 5:00 PM on most school days, there is police presence at
Burger King – unless the officers are called away to handle emergency issues.
 Paul countered the sergeant’s response stating the officers’ habit of occasional
assessment visits, followed by lax follow-up – as they may deem necessary,
should not be considered a sufficient measure.
 We are looking forward to working with the local schools to determine
strategies to thwart issues that are considered to be creating neighborhood
disturbances.
 Paul Goldstein, from Speaker Silver’s Office, has spoken with the Murray
Bergtraum Principal, who is awaiting the approval from the Department of
Education to meet with us, hopefully soon.
School Grading System – Report
 Postponed until January, since no one from the Board of Education was
available to attend our November or our December meetings.
 We are concerned with the value of the new grading systems and question the
manner in which school reporting is conducted. Under the present system, IS
89, recipient of the Federal Education Department Blue Ribbon Award,
received a “D” grade. We hope to address these inconsistencies at the January
committee meeting.
Schools and Youth Amenities – Gratitude
 Extended gratitude to our Elected Officials – in particular to Assembly
Member Shelly Silver and Council Member Alan J. Gerson for their
tremendous support and diligence while gaining momentum for our schools
and youth program.

1. Brooklyn Battery Tunnel Approach – Resolution.
Chairperson Julie Menin suggested tabling this resolution to allow LMDC an
opportunity to include their viewpoints and to obtain input from other affected
parties.
BOARD VOTE: TABLED.
2. Proposed Zoning Text Amendments: Floor Area Calculations in Stairwells of
Residential Building Taller than 125 Feet – Resolution
A change in NYC Building Code, adopted in 2007, will require an increase in the
width of stairwells of residential buildings taller than 125 Feet without an
increase in floor area. This will provide safety and evacuation ability. Yet, this
loss of bulk will result in someone bearing the financial burden. The committee
suggested the following as a means of applying the proposed zoning changes
while not increasing the housing costs: 1) Build more than one additional floor; 2)
Application would not apply to buildings in excess of a footprint of 5,000 sq. feet
unless there’s an affordable housing element included; and 3) Any increase in
permissible height or bulk may not be transferred.
BOARD VOTE: 35 In Favor 1 Opposed 0 Abstained 0 Recused
3. Bulk Modifications and a Clarification Proposal by the American Institute of
Architects – Resolution
A contextual zoning amendment, proposed by the NY Chapter of the AIA, was
presented to the committee. Of six points, five appear to be applicable to CB 1. 1)
Zoning will allow greater lot coverage for smaller corner lots; 2) Remove a
limitation on no more than 2-residential units to allow additional units as
permitted by height and bulk limitations; 3) Restrictions on rear building dormers
will be waived to allow bulk to be shifted more efficiently; 4) Allow the first
setback to be adjusted so that it is consistent with neighboring building’s adjust
setbacks; 5) Allow greater bulkhead flexibility; and the sixth one does not apply
to CB 1.BOARD VOTE: 34 In Favor 2 Opposed 0 Abstained 0 Recused

ATTACHED HERE. PLEASE CONTACT THE CB #1 OFFICE FOR COPIES OF
OTHER RESOLUTIONS.
A. Executive Committee
RE: Proposed recommendation to Governor Pataki that the next appointment to
serve as a State Liquor Authority Commissioner be given to a resident of New York
City
A New York State Liquor Authority Commissioner vacancy currently
exists. The residency and experience of the current Commissioners, none of whom
reside in New York City, does not leave them adequately familiar with the special
circumstances faced by NYC communities regarding liquor licenses to effectively
represent those communities or adjudicate those communities’ issues regarding liquor
licenses.
By a unanimous vote, the Board strongly supports the letter by NYS
Assemblymember Deborah Glick, calling for the appointment of a NYS Liquor
Authority Commissioner who resides in the City of New York, and supports the
proposal that requests Governor Pataki consult with the legislative delegation from
New York City in considering the appointment of the next New York State Liquor
Authority Commissioner.
RE: Grant requests to Friends of Lower Manhattan to support Community Board
operations and projects
By a vote of 33 in favor and 1 abstention, Community Board #1 requests
that Friends of Lower Manhattan provide the Community Board with funds totaling
$92,100 for operations and project expenses.
RE: Appointment of Community Representation to the Board of the Battery
Park City Authority
On January 13, 2006, Governor Pataki signed into law the Public
Authorities Accountability Act of 2005 (the “Act”), which provides for the
increase in the number of board members of the Battery Park City Authority (the
“BPCA”) from three to seven.
One of the stated purposes of the Act is to “ensure greater efficiency,
openness and accountability for our State’s public authorities,” including specifically,
the BPCA.
By a unanimous vote, the Governor is respectfully requested to include
among his new appointments to the enlarged BPCA board a resident of Battery ParkCity, and to fill vacancies on the board in the future with the objective of having at all
times at least one board member who is a resident of Battery Park City.
RE: Thanking Judy Duffy for her services to Community Board #1
Judy Duffy has served as the Assistant District Manager for the past eleven
years, and has consistently performed her duties at CB #1 in a professional and
effective manner.
By a unanimous vote, CB #1 wishes to extend its sincere thanks to Judy
Duffy for her eleven years of excellent service to Community Board #1.
RE: Support of IBO Review of WTC lease issue
The Independent Budget Office (IBO) provides non partisan economic
analysis for the people of New York City. The IBO has provided an analysis of other
major land use projects including the Westside Stadium, Atlantic Yards and the NY
Stock Exchange expansion project.
By a unanimous vote, the Community Board supports the IBO conducting
an independent analysis of the City and Silverstein Properties economic conclusions
regarding the ability of Silverstein Properties to build out the WTC site.
 The salary adjustment for the CB #1 District Manager was discussed.
B. Arts & Entertainment Task Force
RE: Cultural enhancement funds (LMDC) for not-for-profit organizations
The LMDC has established a $35 million Cultural Enhancement Fund and
plans to utilize these funds to provide grants to cultural groups south of Houston Street.
Eligible organizations must be not-for-profit groups that run, or would like to run,
dance, theatre, arts or other cultural programs.
By a vote of 33 in favor and 1 recusal, Community Board #1 authorizes that
letters of support are provided to each of the following organizations which presented
their proposals before our Arts & Entertainment Task Force:
1) Battery Dance Company
2) Collective: Unconscious
3) Synagogue for the Arts
4) Three Legged Dog Theatre

C. Waterfront Committee Una Perkins reported on the possible uses for the newly remodeled Battery
Maritime Building. One option may be to open a food market there.
 Ms. Perkins also reported on the status of Governors Island. Several possible
uses are being considered, including the possibility of opening the ball fields for
use in Spring / Summer.
D. Financial District Committee
 Ray O’Keefe reported on the 4/5 Wall Street Station rehabilitation project.
Rector Street will need to be closed during the project work. The committee
requested to have additional bus service during the project, as well as signage.
James Garvey will provide artwork.
E. Battery Park City Committee
 Linda Belfer reported on Poets House at site 16/17. Poets House is currently
located on Spring Street, and will be relocated to site 16/17. Poets House will
open in 2007.
 The Gateway Plaza taxi stand issue was discussed. A problem exists with the
location of the taxi stand and the entrance and exit areas of the nearby garage at
Gateway Plaza. NYPD temporarily eliminated the taxi stand. A meeting was
held at the Battery Park City Authority, and Steve Weber of NY City DOT was
asked to address the problem. The problem will continue to be addressed.
 The hours of operation of the free bus service provided by the Downtown
Alliance for Lower Manhattan was discussed. A request was made by CB #1 to
extend service hours. The Downtown Alliance cannot accommodate this
request.
RE: Extension of #22 bus service into southern portion of Battery Park City
Prior to 9/11, the #9 bus from South End Avenue, ran up Vesey Street to
Park Row (City Hall) and continued to Chinatown adjacent to the courts. Vesey Street
is now closed to traffic and the #9 bus now has been rerouted via State and Water
Streets. The #22 bus runs from Vesey Street and North End Avenue to Chambers and
Centre Streets and then to Park Row (City Hall) before continuing to Chinatown. On
the return trip the #22 bus enters North End Avenue at Chambers Street makes a left
turn at Murray Street, a right turn at West Street and a right turn on Vesey Street to its
last stop.
By a unanimous vote, CB #1 urges the MTA to extend the route of the #22
bus so that, instead of terminating at Vesey Street, it continues down West Street to
enter southern Battery Park City at West Thames and turns right onto South End
Avenue, to terminate at the #9 terminus at Gateway Plaza, thereby returning to
residents and visitors to southern Battery Park City access to the City Hall area.
F. Seaport / Civic Center CommitteeRE: Association of Indians in America Street Activity Permit for October 1,

and 36 seats and a bar area with 18 seats.
By a vote of 34 in favor and 1 recusal, CB #1 approves the liquor license

 The Ratner / Beekman Street site plans were discussed.
RE: Expanding Pearl Street Park
The Community Board is very pleased that the City has decided to retain
the Pearl Street Park and allocate funds received from the LMDC to renovate thisheavily used park. This park is the only children’s playground located east of
Broadway in CB #1 and this area is experiencing a dramatic increase in its residential
and youth population. There is an opportunity to expand this park to the west by
closing the lightly trafficked leg of Pearl Street which runs along the west side of the
park and expanding the park into this space.
By a unanimous vote, CB #1 strongly urges the LMDC, the NYC
Department of Parks and Recreation and the NYC Department of Transportation to
close the existing one block stretch of Pearl Street which lies west of Pearl Street Park
between Beekman and Fulton Streets and to expand the Pearl Street Park into this area.
G. World Trade Center Redevelopment Committee

Authority regarding retail plans.
RE: Appointment of Federal September 11 Health Czar
Tens of thousands of first responders, Federal employees and residents and
workers and volunteers in Lower Manhattan may suffer from health problems caused
by exposure to toxins at or near the World Trade Center site, including asbestos, lead,
mercury, pulverized glass and other toxic substances.
By a unanimous vote, Community Board #1 strongly supports the bipartisan
call by Representatives Carolyn Maloney and Vito Fossella for the appointment of a
September 11 Federal Health Czar to coordinate the Federal government's response to
short and long term adverse health effects resulting from September 11. The Federal
government must assume responsibility for this and should allocate the necessary
federal funds to ensure that all Lower Manhattan residents, workers, students and
responders have reasonable access to health and mental health monitoring and
treatment.
RE: Proposed State legislation to relocate WTC remains from the Fresh Kills
Landfill
The NYS Legislature is currently considering proposed legislation which
would require the Port Authority of NY and NJ to relocate the ashen remains from
September 11th from the Fresh Kills Landfill to the site of a memorial to be determined
by the Governors of NY and NJ. The NJ Legislature has already passed similar
legislation, signed into law by the Governor, also requiring that the Fresh Kills remainsbe relocated but their legislation specifically says that it should be returned to the WTC
site in Lower Manhattan.
By a vote of 35 in favor and 1 abstention, CB#1 strongly opposes any effort
to re-introduce any WTC debris that currently sits at the Fresh Kills Landfill, back to
the WTC site or anywhere else.
RE: EPA’s 2005 Final Test and Clean Program
The destruction of the World Trade Center not only killed thousands but
also caused multiple contaminants, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs), lead, man-made vitreous fibers (MMVF), mercury, asbestos, and other toxic
substances, to be deposited upon and within residences, places of employment, and
mixed-use buildings in Lower Manhattan. In the summer of 2002, EPA implemented a
poorly publicized, voluntary residential test and clean program that failed to adequately
characterize and clean up WTC contaminants and that provided an inadequate cleanup
of only 3,425 of the more than 25,000 apartments below Canal Street.
By a unanimous vote, CB #1 calls on the EPA to abandon its technically
and scientifically flawed 2005 Test and Clean Program, and work with the residents
and workers, community and labor organizations and elected officials to design and
implement an effective, science based sampling and cleanup program for residences
and workplaces in all affected areas.
CB #1 also calls for the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to
undertake an investigation into the EPA's failure to establish an effective, science-
based testing and clean-up plan in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.
H. Tribeca Committee
RE: Taste of Tribeca Street Activity Permit
The Taste of Tribeca has applied for a street activity permit for Greenwich
Street from Jay to Duane Streets and Duane Street from Hudson to Greenwich Streets
for May 20th. This event provides much needed funding for the local schools and has
become one of the most anticipated downtown events of the year.
By a unanimous vote, Community Board #1 approves the granting of a
street activity permit to the Taste of Tribeca for May 20th.
RE: Tribeca Family Festival Street Activity Permit
The Tribeca Family Festival has applied for a street activity permit for
Greenwich Street from Hubert to Duane Street for May 4th, 5th and 6th as part of the 5th

those impacted by the festival to mitigate the effects of the street closures, includingthe Independence Plaza Tenants Association, Friends of Greenwich Street and
businesses in the area.

granting of a street activity permit to the Tribeca Family Festival for May 4th, 5th and
6th.
RE: 275 Church Street, beer and wine license for Neighborhood Inc.
The applicant proposes to operate a restaurant with 4 tables and 12 seats.
By a vote of 34 in favor and 1 abstention, CB #1 does not oppose the beer
and wine license application for Neighborhood, Inc. located at 275 Church Street for a
period of two years subject to compliance by the applicant with the limitations and
conditions set forth above.
RE: Tribeca North Re-Zoning
Community Board #1 concurs with the Department of City Planning’s
comprehensive approach to having a Study Area that includes all of the remaining land
in the Special Tribeca Mixed Use District.
Community Board #1 concurs with the planning concept of dividing the
block fronts between West Street and Washington Streets into two different areas,
where the street wall and other criteria for the buildings facing the narrow Washington
Street would be at a lower height.
Community Board #1 concurs with the Department of City Planning that
the area known as “A1” (northeastern portion of the Special District) should be a C6-
2A with an FAR of 5.0.
Community Board #1 concurs with the Department of City Planning that
the area known as “A4” (north central portion of the Special District) should also be a
C6-2A, but with an FAR of 5.0 consistent with the FAR of the surrounding areas.
By a vote of 34 in favor and 1 abstention, Community Board #1 urges the
Department of City Planning to work with the Community Board to expeditiously
develop a comprehensive plan for the entire Special Tribeca Mixed Use District and to
clarify its stance and actions in reference to the EIS process.
RE: Jack Parker Site Rezoning Proposal
In 2004, after meeting on several occasions with members of CB 1, the
NYC Department of City Planning created a study area to examine the area of northern
Tribeca in a comprehensive manner which includes the subject area of the this
proposed zoning change (“Parker Site”).The NYC Department of City Planning has sent representatives several
times to discuss the analysis developed by CB #1 and its consultant and their proposed
study to re-zone the northern Tribeca subject area in a comprehensive manner and
promised to respond to our issues in a timely fashion.
The NYC Department of City Planning recently finalized a rezoning of the
area immediately to the north of the Parker Site in its Hudson Square rezoning and in
analyzing that rezoning, City Planning performed a full Environmental Impact
Statement wherein alternative zoning scenarios were reviewed and their respective
impacts analyzed.
By a unanimous vote, CB #1 strongly urges that the City Planning
Commission NOT consider the “Parker Site” application ready for certification until all
items including, but not limited to, a full Environmental Impact Statement has been
completed, and we further urge that the Department of City Planning expeditiously
move on preparing its own Environmental Impact Statement and work with CB#1 to
develop a comprehensive plan for the entire study area.

has been meeting with State politicians to ensure that the City receives funding as part of
the five – year capital plan. The Beekman Street School and the P.S. 234 annex represent
2 of a total of 32 schools included in the plan. Deputy Mayor Walcott urged Community
Board #1 to write to its political leaders and demand that funding is secured for these
schools and construction is completed in a timely manner.
Deputy Mayor Walcott addressed questions from the audience and engaged in a
spirited discussion regarding the propriety of cutting funding for promised schools in an
effort to achieve more State funding.

Street School and the P.S. 234 annex, and acknowledged that funding for the construction
of the schools is critical. He further stated that it is unacceptable to allow any delay in

Tribeca Committee
RE: Jack Parker Group Application for Amendment to Zoning
Over the past several years Community Board #1 (“CB#1”) and the New York City
Department of City Planning (“DCP”) have been working in a joint effort to develop a
comprehensive plan for the entire study area of the northern part of the Tribeca Mixed Use
Special District (the “Study Area”).
Representatives of DCP subsequently presented a preliminary comprehensive
rezoning plan for the entire Study Area to the Tribeca Committee of CB#1 and advised
CB#1 that an Environmental Impact Statement would be required to change the zoning in
the entire study area and that DCP would assign an employee to work on the project and
address questions presented by CB#1.
CB #1 requested schematics for several Floor Area Ratio (FAR) variations of the
proposed comprehensive rezoning plan for the Study Area and answers to various
questions concerning the entire Study Area that have not been provided to date.The Jack Parker Group has filed an application for an amendment to the Zoning
Resolution requesting the following actions: (a) the rezoning from M1-5 to C6-3A and C6-
2A of four blocks in the Special Tribeca Mixed Use District; (b) certain text amendments
to the Special Tribeca Mixed Use District; and (c) a Special Permit under Sections 13-562
and 74-52 to permit a public parking garage of 180 spaces in a proposed, new, primarily
residential building to be constructed on Block 224 bounded by West, Washington, Watts
and Desbrosses Streets (collectively, the “Parker Application”).
By a unanimous vote, CB#1 strongly and unequivocally opposes the Parker
Application (ULURP application) on the grounds that it is inappropriate for the area and
untimely in light of the proposed rezoning of the entire northern portion of the Special
Tribeca Mixed Use District, especially since this area will continue to undergo the
cumulative impact of significant traffic, noise and other environmental effects of all the
Lower Manhattan redevelopment projects (including the Route 9A project which will
directly interact with the Parker site) and these effects should have been taken into account
by City Planning in evaluating whether or not to issue a negative declaration.
RE: 360 Broadway, liquor license application for Lower Manhattan Pool Gallery Inc.
The applicant proposes to operate an art gallery along with an eating and drinking
establishment in a 3000 square foot space at 360 Broadway. The proposed maximum hours
of operation will be 6:00 PM until 3:00 AM Thursday through Saturday.
By a unanimous vote, CB #1 strongly opposes the new liquor license application
for Lower Manhattan Pool Gallery Inc. at 360 Broadway and requests the State Liquor
Authority hold a 500 foot hearing to address the above concerns.
RE: 134 West Broadway, sidewalk cafe renewal for Jada Restaurant Inc. d/b/a Petite
Abeill
The applicant has applied for a sidewalk cafe renewal license for 7 tables and 14
seats. The proposed hours of operation will be 8 AM until midnight Monday through
Thursday, 8 AM until 1:00 AM on Friday and Saturday and noon until midnight on
Sunday.
By a vote of 41 in favor and 1 opposed, CB #1 does not object to the sidewalk café
renewal license for Jada Restaurant Inc. d/b/a Petite Abeill at 134 West Broadway for a
period of two years.
RE: 156 Chambers St., wine and beer license application for Tribeca Kitchenette, Inc.
The applicant proposes to operate a restaurant with 12 tables and 55 seats. The
proposed maximum hours of operation will be 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM Sunday
through Thursday, 9:00 AM to 11:00 PM on Friday and Saturday.By a unanimous vote, CB #1 does not oppose the restaurant wine license
application for Tribeca Kitchenette Inc. located at 156 Chambers Street for a period of two
years.
RE: 53/55 Beach Street, BSA application to allow Montessori school on the third floor
In 2003, Community Board #1 and the BSA approved variance applications to
permit the operation of a Montessori school at 53/55 Beach Street in portions of the first
and second floor. The applicant is now seeking to expand this pre-school use (Use Group
3) into the third floor. The Montessori School has proved to be quite successful serving
approximately 150 students with a staff of 25. The proposed expansion would allow
approximately 60 additional children to attend to be serviced by 10 additional teachers.
By a unanimous vote, Community Board #1 recommends that the BSA approve
application #359.02-BZ to permit the expansion of the existing Montessori school at 53/55
Beach Street to the third floor.
Combined Tribeca & Landmarks Committees
RE: 180 West Broadway, modifications to the proposed building and BSA application
The variance request to “build full” on the 180 West Broadway footprint, which is
actually a combination of two lots, when zoning requires a 1,200 square-foot courtyard
with a 30-foot setback, is still before the Board of Standards and Appeals.
A motion seeking disapproval of the remaining variance being sought was voted
down by the Community Board by a vote of 15 in favor, 22 opposed, 1 abstained and 2
recused.
Youth & Education Committee
Paul Hovitz reported on the progress of the Ball Fields Task Force. He further
announced intentions to send a letter of support for New York Academy of Science.
RE: Beekman Street School Catchment Area
Community Board #1 supports and expects that the planned Beekman Street school
will begin construction on schedule. This new 630 seat school is intended to serve grades
pre-Kindergarten through 8th grade. Recognizing that our Lower Manhattan district is
experiencing dramatic population growth and that it is critical that we provide additional
school seats now to address this serious issue, Community Board #1 received wide support
and a commitment from the Mayor, the School Chancellor and Dept. of Education, the
Governor, the LMDC and all our local elected officials to build the new Beekman Street
School.By a vote of 37 in favor, 1 opposed and 2 abstained, Community Board #1 strongly
urges the NYC Department of Education and Region 9 to zone the new Beekman Street
elementary school to serve the Community Board #1 district so that these additional school
seats would serve the surging population of Community Board #1 with preference for
students living east of Broadway and south of the Brooklyn Bridge.
Battery Park City Committee
Jeff Galloway provided a progress report of the planned recreational space along
Route 9A. He further discussed the upcoming dredging of the Battery Park City North
Cove Marina.
Landmarks Committee
RE: 117 Hudson Street, aka 50-54 North Moore Street, application for approval to
create a mezzanine above the level of the sixth floor and a one-story rooftop
penthouse addition
The application is to replace the windows with wood 2-over-2 painted frames as
were originally used, the color of which will be based on a paint analysis which is yet to be
completed.
By a unanimous vote, CB#1 recommends that LPC approve the application, after a
paint color is provided for the windows and a profile drawing of the building has been
reviewed.
RE: 254 Front Street, formerly Jeremy’s Ale House, application for approval to do a
total demolition of the building, and build an 8-story building that includes condos
on 7 stories and 1 retail tenant on the ground level
The applicant’s historian explained that the building was noted as non contributing
in the Designation report while the new building drew inspiration from other modern
buildings in the Seaport Historic District. The 8- story building of full height corrugated
metal pilasters, used to connote brick columns, veneer wood like panels around the
windows to recall brick on neighboring buildings, and a totally bland stucco penthouse
addition would, it is claimed, be a comfortable and contributing modern building on this
very visible historic corner site.
By a unanimous vote, CB #1 recommends that LPC reject the application.RE: Parker Rezoning Proposal, impacts on historic resources
Community Board #1 strongly disagrees with the opinion of the Landmarks
Preservation Commission staff that an Environmental Impact Statement is not required for
the rezoning proposal under consideration because “development under rezoning would
not have the potential for significant adverse impacts on this historic resource (the Fleming
Smith Warehouse, at 451 Washington Street),” (DCP letter dated 02/09/06). The L.P.C.
makes no mention of all the other historic structures affected by this application.
By a unanimous vote, CB #1 recommends that Landmark designation should
ensure that when construction occurs near a landmark building, construction procedures
will be specified and monitored by qualified professionals.
RE: 140 Nassau Street, proposed designation
140 Nassau St., The Morse Building, was designed by Silliman & Farnsworth in
1878-80 and because of its popularity, enlarged with a five story addition
by Bannister & Schell in 1900-02.
By a unanimous vote, Community Board #1 highly commends the restoration of
140 Nassau St. and strongly recommends that the Landmarks Preservation Commission
approves this application for designation.
RE: 253 Broadway, application for window replacement
This 1892 Harding and Gouch building has windows that are in poor condition.
The proposal is to follow the window replacement scheme previously approved by LPC for
the neighboring 256 Broadway.
By a unanimous vote, CB #1 recommends that LPC approve the application.

ONLY RESOLUTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN REVISED / MODIFIED ARE
ATTACHED HERE.
PLEASE CONTACT THE CB #1 OFFICE FOR COPIES OF OTHER
RESOLUTIONS
Seaport / Civic Center Committee
RE: Co-naming of Park Row between Beekman and Spruce Streets for Elizabeth
Jennings
In 1854 an African-American teacher named Elizabeth Jennings was
forcibly removed from a whites-only streetcar at the corner of Pearl Street
and Chatham Street (now Park Row).
With the support of her family and her abolitionist church community she
sued the Third Avenue Railways Company and won a court ruling stating
that African-Americans “had the same rights as others” an important ruling
that ultimately helped to overturn segregated public transportation.
By a vote of 37 in favor and 1 opposed, CB #1 supports the co-naming of
the eastside of Park Row between Beekman Street and Spruce Street
Elizabeth Jennings Way. CB #1 requests that some sort of plaque be
installed in the sidewalk or elsewhere informing people of who Elizabeth
Jennings was and why she is being honored at this location.
RE: Reconsideration of boundaries for Peck Slip open space
CB #1 is very supportive of plans to create a new community open space in
the center of Peck Slip. The Peck Slip open space has not yet been designed
but has already generated considerable community discussion. NYC DOT
had come before the Community Board in December 2004 both to create
footprints for the new park space and to establish the parameters of their
capital project to re-cobblestone Peck Slip and vicinity. The Community
Board was recently approached by local residents and representatives of the
Seaport Speaks charrette in support of a piazza-style design for Peck Slip
which calls for no curbs and all cobblestones.
By a unanimous vote, CB #1 rescinds its December 2004 approval of a
geometric street plan for Peck Slip and the curb locations for the new open
space. CB #1 calls on the NYC Parks Department to immediately begin a
design process, with considerable Community Board and community input,
for the new Peck Slip open space.Seaport / Civic Center & Tribeca Committees
RE: Proposal to allow on street parking from 7pm – 12am on the south side of
Canal Street from Broadway to the Manhattan Bridge
This application, made by the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and the
Chinatown Partnership, would change the current parking regulations from
“NO STANDING ANYTIME” to a revised regulation allowing on street
parking after 7 PM seven days a week on the south side of Canal Street
from Broadway to the Manhattan Bridge, possibly with the installation of
meters.
By a unanimous vote, CB #1 supports this proposed parking regulations
change and requests that a feasibility study be conducted by the NYC DOT.
Tribeca Committee

RE: 181 Duane St., wine and beer application for 181 Duane Ristorante d/b/a

for 7 tables and 24 seats. The proposed hours of operation will be 8 AM
until midnight Monday through Thursday, 8 AM until 1:00 AM on Friday
and Saturday and noon until midnight on Sunday. The owner of Radiante
LLC is also the owner of the building and the Community Board is on
record expressing its serious concerns regarding their aggressively seeking
the improper eviction of his tenants.
By a vote of 22 in favor, 12 opposed and 3 abstained, CB #1 recommends
rejecting the application as submitted by Radiante LLC.

examined to ensure that the tables placed on the sidewalk (as opposed to the

RE: Liquor license establishments facing revocation of licenses due to proximity
to mosque on West Broadway
The Mosque has reported that it has no objection to co-existing in close
proximity to the three existing restaurants that are within 200 feet of its
entrance. Community Board #1 has no objection to the continued operation
of these three existing restaurants. The signage printed on the glass panel of
the recessed door has wording that is not clear that the building is a house of
worship.
By a vote of 37 in favor and 1 opposed, CB #1 has no objection to the
Liquor Authority finding that the existing restaurants operated in good faith
and should continue to operate with a liquor license.
Financial District Committee
RE: 10 Hanover Square, BSA variance application to allow the operation of a
Physical Culture Establishment
10 Hanover Square was recently vacated by Goldman Sachs and the upper
floors are being converted to residential use. Goldman Sachs had for many
years operated a physical culture establishment (PCE) as an amenity to their
employees on the ground floor, cellar and sub-cellar of this building.
Goldman Sachs still wishes to maintain the PCE facility for use by
employees of Goldman Sachs and residents of the building. Because this
facility will no longer be an accessory use, it now requires a BSA special
permit.
By a unanimous vote, CB #1 supports the granting of a physical culture
establishment variance at 10 Hanover Square.
RE: Proposed relocation of the Bowling Green Greenmarket 2 blocks south to
Whitehall Street between Water and Pearl Streets
Construction planned for Bowling Green necessitates the relocation of the
Greenmarket which has been operating at this location for over 10 years.

Landmarks Committee
RE: 166 Duane Street, application for modifications to a roof deck fence
The applicant did not appear at the Community Board.
By a unanimous vote, The Landmarks Preservation Commission is urged to
hold over this application until the applicant makes its presentation before
the Landmarks Committee of Community Board #1 Manhattan.
RE: 72 Reade Street, application to add a rooftop terrace
This application requests the modification of, and exterior addition to, an
existing rooftop terrace. The proposal does not ask for any additional fully
enclosed space. Four 6 ½ -foot pylons would be added to the southern edge
of the terrace, forming and supporting the ceilings of two square
“pavilions.” One “pavilion” would have a seasonal canvas top and opensides, and the other would have an innovative ceiling made of plantings
supported invisibly by a modular cable system underneath it.
By a vote of 35 in favor and 1 opposed, Community Board #1 recommends
that the Landmarks Preservation Commission approve this application, with
the substitution of pylons of smaller volume.
RE: Tribeca Historic Districts Extension
In July 2005, members of Community Board #1, met with Tribeca residents
who had created a Conservancy Committee to sponsor research and request
an extension of the Tribeca South Historic District.
The Board and Committee agreed that the area bounded by Broadway to the
east, Church Street to the west, Chambers Street to the north and Warren
Street to the south meet the criteria for designation on the grounds of both
architecture and historic events, and noted that the designation would help
provide much needed guidance to signage and storefronts for commercial
tenants on Chambers Street as well as improve the sense of place of the
neighborhood One important building in the proposed extension, 16
Warren Street has been completely demolished since the submittal of the
proposal to the Landmarks Preservation Commission. This part of Tribeca
is under constant threat of inappropriate and architecturally unreviewed
redevelopment, and since July 2005, at least three structures (8-10 Warren;
88 Chambers; and 92 Chambers) have been altered.
Tribeca North, the area bounded by Canal to the north, Hubert Street to the
south, West Street to the west, and Hudson Street to the east is under the
same constant threat of inappropriate redevelopment, and also contains
many unprotected areas. A large number of Tribeca North residents seek to
sponsor the research and request for an extension to the Tribeca North
Historic District (""Tribeca North Historic District Extension-2006"").
By a unanimous vote, CB#1 strongly recommends that LPC schedule a
public hearing in the immediate future to review applications for Tribeca
South Historic District Extension-2006 and Tribeca North Historic District
Extension-2006.
RE: New Department of Buildings safeguards for construction adjacent to
landmark structures
Development is widespread in Community Board 1. A significant amount
of new construction takes place in close proximity to historic buildings.
The existing New York City Buildings Department standard, NYC
TIPPN#10/88, has not been updated for many years. New, more informed
standards have been recently created regionally; notably, MassachusettsHighway Department – Central Artery/ Tunnel, “Design Policy
Memorandum No1 (Revision 6) Construction Impact Mitigation.” and
internationally, Swiss Standards Association, SN 604312, “Criteria for
Construction Vibrations” to preserve these masterworks from the past.
These documents as well as others have significantly raised the bar for
protection and preservation of historic structures world-wide.
By a unanimous vote, Community Board #1 recommends that the
Landmarks Preservation Commission work with the New York City
Department of Buildings to create and enforce a new more informed
standard to safeguard and preserve the rich architectural history of New
York City.
Youth & Education Committee
A report was given regarding the proposed Waldorf School in Lower Manhattan.
The Beekman Street school 6th to 8th grade configuration was also discussed. Finally, a
report was given regarding the Battery Park City ball fields and community access.
Waterfront Committee
RE: NY Trapeze School Request
The applicant has been operating the NY Trapeze School located in the
north end of Segment 3 of the Hudson River Park Trust (HRPT) for the past
five years. They seek approval to make some modifications to their existing
operation prior to their move several blocks north.
By a vote of 35 in favor and 2 opposed, CB #1 approves the request by the
NY Trapeze School and encourages them to continue to work closely with
the HRPT to ensure they can continue their operation.
An update was given regarding Governor’s Island, and a report was given on the
Seaport Speaks Charrette and its recommendations for the Seaport area.
New Business:
RE: Deutsche Bank Demolition Update (aka 130 Liberty Street)
The demolition in a densely populated area of the heavily contaminated
high-rise building at 130 Liberty Street, poses risks to the workers on the
job and to people who live and work in the surrounding area. The
abatement and demolition of 130 Liberty should be carried out only by
responsible contractors with the experience and qualifications to do the job
safely and effectively.John Galt Corporation has been contracted by the Lower Manhattan
Development Corporation (LMDC) for abatement and deconstruction work
at 130 Liberty Street. Safeway Environmental was also contracted by
LMDC to work at 130 Liberty Street.
Recently, two workers employed by Safeway and John Galt Corporation,
respectively, have suffered serious injuries in the course of their work at the
site. The New York Daily News has reported that Safeway and John Galt
Corporation have ties to each other, and Safeway has a poor safety record
and is barred from bidding on New York City School Construction
Authority contracts (NY Daily News article “Mob link eyed in bank
demolition,” by Greg B. Smith, April 16, 2006,
http://www.nydailynews.com/news/local/story/409209p-346370c.html).
Serious questions have been raised regarding the business integrity of
Safeway and the City Department of Investigations is probing Safeway’s
ties to Harold Greenberg, who according to the New York Times was
convicted of paying a bribe to a federal environmental inspector to overlook
violations in an asbestos removal project in 1988 and was convicted of wire
fraud in a bid-rigging scheme in 1993 (“Demolition Company To Have
Role Downtown,” New York Times, by Alan Feurer, July 16, 2005).
We understand that John Galt Corporation has only recently obtained an
asbestos removal license, as required by New York State Department of
Labor and the New York City Department of Environmental Protection.
The Procurement Policy Board Rules of the City of New York state that
“the City may award contracts only to responsible contractors. A
responsible contractor is one who has the capability in all respects to
perform the contract requirements fully and the business integrity to justify
the award of public tax dollars.”
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has expressed serious
concerns (again recently in their latest letter dated April 11, 2006,
http://www.epa.gov/wtc/demolish_deconstruct/130libertyst_41106.pdf )
about the abatement and demolition plans and procedures the LMDC and its
contractors are developing and following.
By a unanimous vote, Community Board #1 demands that LMDC only use
companies with appropriate qualifications and experience to properly
conduct abatement and demolition at 130 Liberty. Community Board #1
calls on LMDC to adopt the procurement policy language from the City of
New York in its contracting process, and that LMDC and its contractors
adhere to it in all hiring decisions. Community Board #1 calls on LMDC to
quickly revise all demolition plans in accordance with EPA and the
regulatory team. Community Board #1 calls on the EPA to play a moreactive role not only in assessing the abatement and demolition plans and
procedures, but in fully evaluating and approving any contractor to be hired.
RE: Commencement of Construction of Memorial and Memorial Museum
CB #1 has reaffirmed its position in numerous resolutions (September 2002,
January 2003, July 2003, February 2004, April 2004, July 2005, October
2005, November 2005 and December 2005) that the WTC site should be
redeveloped as quickly as possible in a manner compatible with the goals of
developing a vibrant economy and a livable and dynamic mixed-use
community.
CB #1 is concerned about additional possible delays in the planning and
construction of the memorial and memorial museum and strongly opposes
the lawsuit brought by the Coalition of 9/11 Families and others against the
Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC) in an effort to stop
construction of the memorial on various grounds.
CB #1 believes that the extensive cumulative effects analysis conducted in
connection with the excavation and construction work to be conducted at
the WTC site satisfies the requirements of the World Trade Center
Transportation Hub Section 106 Memorandum of Agreement and that the
plans for the memorial and memorial museum strike a reasonable balance
between the need to commence construction promptly on the WTC site and
to protect remnants at the site that have been deemed eligible for and
worthy of such protection under the National Historic Preservation Act.
By a unanimous vote, CB #1 urges Governor Pataki, Mayor Bloomberg,
City Council Member Gerson and other elected officials involved in the
rebuilding process to support the rebuilding of the WTC site without further
delay in accordance with the Master Plan and the designs for the memorial
and memorial museum approved following the public design process.
CB #1 strongly supports the LMDC in its defense of the lawsuit brought by
the Coalition of 9/11 Families and others to stop construction of the
memorial on various grounds and hereby approves and authorizes the
participation of CB#1 in the filing of a brief as amicus curiae in support of
the LMDC by various Section 106 Consulting Parties and others if the
Community Board is permitted to do so by law.CB #1 urges the WTC Memorial Foundation to reject demands being made
by the Coalition of 9/11 Families and others to expand the scope of the
memorial and memorial museum beyond that approved and to proceed
without any further delay to construct the memorial and memorial museum
and the Gehry-designed cultural and performing arts center as part of the
Master Plan for the WTC site.

instituted for Lower Manhattan. Pat Moore responded that since permits for fireworks

NOTE: SEE RESOLUTIONS AT END OF MINUTES
A. WTC Redevelopment Committee
It was reported that there is a plan for the deconstruction of 4 Albany Street. The
time line is approximately 26 weeks.
Regarding the future or Fitterman Hall (aka 20-32 West Broadway), the President
of BMCC will keep the Board updated on the plans for the site. BMCC and its Board said
that the building will be coming down and be rebuilt, but it needs financial assistance to
do so.
A schematic design is coming to fruition for the World Trade Center memorial
site.
B. Landmarks Committee
Eric Anderson presented on behalf of the committee.
RE: 321 – 323 Church Street, application to legalize alterations to a storefront,
installation of awning signs, a rooftop railing and a through-wall air conditioning unit
without Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) approval
The three violations are to a one-story, noncommercial building on the corner of
Lispenard Street. A new awning was installed with inappropriate dimensions and signage
that does not appear to follow DOB code. The original awning was approved and it was
recommended that a master plan be prepared for 321 and 323, which would bring both
awnings into compliance with the DOB code and LPC practice for awnings. The rooftop
railing complied with DOB code which the Committee had no objection with legalizing.
The poorly installed through-wall air conditioning unit should be replaced with a roof
vented system.
By a unanimous (38 member) vote, the Board resolved to recommend that the
Landmarks Preservation Commission legalize the alterations.
RE: 71 Hudson Street (3 Staple Street), application for a storefront alteration.
By a unanimous vote, the Board recommends the LPC approve the application for
an alteration to replace a poor infill storefront on Staple Street.
RE: 16 Hudson Street, application to construct a rooftop addition
By a unanimous vote, the Board urges LPC to reject the application. While the
proposed materials are acceptable, the committee believes that, given the importance of
the building, any rooftop addition should be invisible from the south, and less visible
from the east than proposed in the application. If these goals can be achieved, the
application will then be reconsidered and referred back to the Board for an approval.RE: 31-33 Vestry Street, application to construct a new nine-story residential building
By a unanimous vote, the Board resolves that it urges LPC to reject the
application and asks the ground floor of the site be modified by the applicant to be more
transparent and to not set back from the street wall.
The Committee found the design above the first floor fresh and oddly contextual,
but the Committee found the Vestry Street ground floor to be unacceptable as proposed
due to its setback from the street and its extensive use of stone both on the opaque façade
and at the sidewalk level within the recess.
The applicant must be referred back to the Community Board and the Tribeca
Committee with its proposal if it intends to seek a BSA variance. A presentation that
includes rendered elevations and a thorough study of sightlines is to be included.
C. Battery Park City Committee
A report on complaints regarding helicopter noise in Battery Park City was given.
Tour operators are scheduled to attend the March Battery Park City Committee meeting
to discuss the issue.
A traffic study performed by the Department of Transportation will be requested
by the Committee regarding the pedestrian crossings on South End Avenue.
D. Financial District Committee
RE: 63 Wall Street, CPC special permit to allow a public parking garage with 85
spaces in the cellar level of an existing building
After extended discussion among Board members regarding the parking and
public policy concerns, there was a vote of 30 in favor, 3 opposed and 3 abstaining to
approve the application for a special permit pursuant to Sections 12-562 and 74-52 of the
Zoning Resolution of the City of New York to allow a public parking garage with 85
spaces located in the cellar level of 63 Wall Street.
RE: 55 Church Street, CPC application to permit the establishment of an open air café
in an existing urban plaza
The Millennium Hilton at 55 Church Street seeks approval of an application to
modify the requirements of the Zoning Resolution to permit the establishment of an
open-air café in an existing urban plaza.
The hours of operation of the café would be noon until 10 PM seven says a week
and there has been a proposal by the applicant to add 150 linear feet of public seating on
the Fulton Street side of the plaza.
By a unanimous vote by the Board, the application for a special permit to allow
the establishment of an open-air café at 55 Church Street was approved.E. Seaport/Civic Center Committee
A report was given on the problem of illegal parking by vehicles with NYPD and
other agency parking permits in the district. A crackdown on this abuse was requested.
There is no news to report regarding the NYU hospital site. Talks continue
regarding putting a school into the new residential building.
RE: Co-naming of Duane Street for FBI agent Leonard Hatton
By a vote of 36 in favor, 1 opposed and 1 abstention, the Board urges the City
Council to co-name Duane Street between Broadway and Lafayette Streets for FBI
Special Agent Leonard H. Hatton who joined NYC firefighters in evacuating occupants
of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001 and was killed when the towers
collapsed.
F. Tribeca Committee
RE: 60 Hudson Street, proposal to install planters and bollards
60 Hudson Street is proposing to place a combination of planters and bollards on
the West Broadway and Hudson Street perimeters of 60 Hudson Street and the Board
applauds the proposal to remove the unsightly Jersey barriers, which have been put in
place since September 11, 2001.
The proposal, though, does not include placement of bollards or planters on the
Worth or Thomas Street sides of the building, which raises questions about why they are
needed at all. Also, the proposed planters are unnecessarily large and unsightly
obstructions that will occupy too much of the sidewalk, impede pedestrian flow and look
inappropriate in front of this historic building.
By a vote of 36 in favor, 1 opposed and 2 abstentions, the Board would prefer that
there not be any obstructions on the sidewalk in front of this building, including planters,
bollards, and Jersey barriers. If it is determined by the Police Task Force on Terrorism or
some other agency having jurisdiction over the security for the building that some sort of
security barriers are needed for 60 Hudson Street, they should be limited to bollards,
which the Board understands provide better security than planters.
If it is necessary to install planters, there should be as few as possible and they
should be designed to be small and unobtrusive and complement the historic character of
the landmarked building. The City should ensure that there are enforceable guarantees in
place requiring these planters and the plants housed in them be maintained.
The building management, too, shall use all reasonable efforts, including but not
limited to, requesting police department enforcement to keep all push-cart vendors on the
street side of any security barriers.
The bus stop currently in front of the building should be maintained and there
should be unrestricted access to both bus doors from the sidewalk.Community Board #1 requests a meeting with the security consultants and
designers to better understand the need for any barriers outside the building and review
the actual designs for them.
G. Tribeca Licensing Task Force
RE: 319 Broadway, liquor license transfer for Dracula’s House Inc.
By a vote of 38 in favor and 1 opposed, the Board does not oppose the transfer of
the existing two-year license two years subject to compliance of the applicant with the
limitations and conditions set forth below.
The applicant agrees to reduce the proposed maximum of hours of operation from
the hours initially requested to 11 AM until 12 AM Sunday through Thursday and 11 AM
until 2 AM Friday and Saturday.
The applicant will not be seeking a cabaret license or sidewalk café license.
The applicant represented that the kitchen in the establishment is properly vented
and that all reasonable steps will be taken to ensure that residents in neighboring
buildings will not be bothered by cooking smells.
The applicant indicated that the establishment will continue to have live music,
but represented that the insulation was adequate and agreed to operate it as a piano bar
only and with not more than 3 musicians playing at any time without amplification as
appropriate for an establishment located in a residential neighborhood.
The applicant has agreed to cooperate with the residents of adjacent buildings to
ensure that it is operated in a reasonable manner taking into consideration its location in a
residential neighborhood.
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned."

E. Landmarks Committee
RE: 53 Murray Street, application to alter storefront and legalize existing windows
By a unanimous vote, the Board has no objection to legalizing the windows at 53
Murray Street, but requests that the Landmarks Preservation Commission hold over this
matter until the Board has the opportunity to fully consider the application.
The application to alter the storefront could not be properly considered because
there were no tax photos, section plans, or material boards prepared for the meeting.RE: 130 Duane Street, application to install canopies, signage, and new storefront
treatment not previously approved by the Landmarks Preservation Commission
This application requests the addition to the new hotel being built in the Tribeca
South Historic District of metal canopies on both Church and Duane Streets, as well as a
redesign of the Church Street street-front façade.
Councilmember Alan Gerson appeared at the Landmarks Committee hearing of
Community Board #1 Manhattan, urging the Board to reject all consideration of this
application until Hersha, the hotel’s developer/builder, and Gene Kauffman, the project
architect, respond to frequent and ongoing concerns of Councilmember Gerson, the
Community Board, and neighborhood residents.
By a unanimous vote, the Board recommends that the LPC reject the request for a
canopy addition on Duane Street. The Board cannot recommend approval of any other
elements of this plan until the developer/builder and architect honor their commitments to
the community to make a full presentation of building plans.
RE: 85 Leonard Street, application to legalize transoms above the door
By a unanimous vote, Community Board #1 recommends that the Landmarks
Preservation Commission hold over the application until the Board has the opportunity to
fully consider the application. This matter could not be considered, as there were no
pictures detailing the illegal installation.
RE: 245 Water Street, application to alter storefront
By a unanimous vote, the Board recommends that the Landmarks Preservation
Commission approve this application. The new storefront will match the historic tax
photo and consist of painted wood, in historically appropriate colors.
RE: 276 Water Street, application to construct a new six-story residential building
By a unanimous vote, the Board recommends that the Landmarks Preservation
Commission reject this application in its present state.
Because of the existing site’s extremely difficult relationship to its surroundings,
the lot’s irregular shape, the architects have attempted to freehand the structure’s Dover
Street and rear elevations; the result is risky.
RE: 141 Duane Street, application to alter storefront
By a unanimous vote, the Board urges Landmarks to hold over this application
until the applicant returns to the Community Board with the required items for full
presentation (material samples and color samples provided by the applicant).RE: 45 White Street, application for a one-story penthouse addition, new windows,
and storefront alteration
By a unanimous vote, the Board approves of the alterations to the windows and
storefront with noted amendments, has no objections to the one-story addition, and
recommends the LPC approve this application.
RE: 21-23 South William Street, application for a rooftop addition
This application is identical to one the Board recommended for approval
previously, except for the elimination here of one of the two stories proposed originally
for a rooftop addition. The Landmarks Preservation Commission has suggested that this
plan would be approved after the removal of that extra story.
By a unanimous vote, the Board has no objections to the Landmarks’ suggestions
(to which the applicants represent they have complied), and recommends approval.
RE: 25 Peck Slip, application for a one-story addition, storefront restoration, and
removal of existing fire escape.
By a unanimous vote, the Board recommends that the LPC approve this
application for a one-story addition, storefront restoration, and removal of existing fire
escape.

The LPC has found the transom installations technically illegal because they do

mounted on a simple armature attached to a currently blacked-out wooden infill panel
above the front door. The existing flagpole should be removed. The signage change is
acceptable to the Board.
The color of the storefront, however, is inappropriate and should be changed.
By a vote of 42 in favor, the Board suggests that the LPC approve the flagpole
and sign changes, but reject legalization of the storefront colors.
RE: 25 Leonard Street, application for restoration of façade, waterproofing, repainting,
and restoration of bulkhead, replacement of doors and transoms, lobby restoration, and
replacement of interior finishes
By a vote of 42 in favor, Community Board #1 recommends that the LPC reject
the applicant’s designs for doors, transoms, and colors. Approval of remaining work,
however, is recommended.
The property is the center structure of an architecturally matching three-building
assemblage, each whose first-floor facades work together harmoniously. The new doors
and transoms should match those of the neighbors immediately to the east and west of 25
Leonard Street.
The proposed jet-black color for the doors and applicant’s proposal to replace the
front doors and transoms with reconfigured ones is unacceptable.
RE: 145 Hudson Street, application to amend Certificate of Appropriateness, for
rooftop recreation area, and clarification of prior approval of rooftop addition and
mechanical equipment
By a vote of 41 in favor and 1 abstention, the Board cannot make a
recommendation on the penthouse addition if the plans for the construction were stamped
“approved”, mistakenly or otherwise, by the LPC.
By that same vote, CB #1 does not recommend that the LPC legalize the
noncompliance of the mechanical equipment as presented and recommends that the LPC
reject the application for an enlarged recreational area as presented.C. WTC Redevelopment Committee
Richard Kennedy welcomed the new construction coordinator, Charles Maikish.
He also reported to the Board on the clean up of 130 Liberty Street. Once new
information is received, the Board will be updated.
D. Combined Waterfront, Financial District, and Seaport/Civic Center
Committee
RE: East River Waterfront, revised restoration plan by the City
Many of the recommendations in the City’s East River Waterfront Plan derived
from the East River Waterfront Plan put together in 2002 by the Community Board, the
Alliance for Downtown NY and Skidmore Owings and Merrill.
The revised plans for the East River Waterfront include the following elements:
 A new esplanade and bike path with plantings, a boardwalk and
new street furniture
 Improved connections to the waterfront by removing current
blockages (barriers, fences, parked cars, buses)
 Pavilions beneath the FDR Drive for community recreational,
cultural, and retail use
 The rebuilding of Pier 15 as a maritime and community amenity
 The creation of Peck Slip Park
 Funding to restore the New Market Building into a community
amenity
 Improved pedestrian and vehicular connections at the Battery
Maritime Building by extending the tunnel from West Street, with
funding coming from other sources
 Integration of this plan with other proposed improvements in the
area to Fulton Street, Burling Slip, Pier 17 etc.
By a vote of 43 in favor, the Board strongly supports the revised East River
Waterfront Plan prepared by City Planning and the Office of the Mayor, which outlines a
short-term series of improvements to the waterfront from the Battery to the Williamsburg
Bridge in Community Board #3.
Community Board #1 reiterates that the full funding of this project ($150 million)
and the $70 million needed for Hudson River Park are our two highest priorities for
funding from the remaining $800+ million from the LMDC controlled CDBG funds and
we very strongly urge the LMDC to provide these two vital projects with this requested
full funding.
The estimated year of completion of this project is 2010.E. Battery Park City Committee
A report was presented to the Board on the helicopters flying overhead in the
area. Liberty Helicopters came to the Committee meeting in March to discuss their
business over lower Manhattan. The representatives were very cooperative to community
needs. They have decided to fly the helicopters higher overhead so that the noise caused
will be reduced.
Information was provided on the rebuilding of the North Cove Marina. Michael
Fortenbaugh from Manhattan Sailing Club and Dennis Conner, along with two other
partners, head The North Cove Marina Management. The management company was
chosen by the Battery Park City Authority to operate the marina. The marina will house
yachts and hopes to host other events once the sailing season begins.
A new dog run in Battery Park City, near the Gateway Plaza, is to open in a few
weeks.
F. Financial District Committee
A discussion was held before voting on the proposed street fairs. There were
conflicts of interest regarding on the voting procedures of proposed fairs. It was
suggested that instead of voting all street fairs together, the Community Board #1-
sponsored street fairs should be voted on separate from other street fairs proposed in the
CB #1 district.
RE: Proposed street fairs (please see attached)
The Community Board approved all street fairs but three. Those three were to be
located on Broadway, but the Committee stated that they would be approved if the
location changed. Other possible venues suggested by the Committee were Maiden Lane,
Water Street, and West Street.
G. Youth & Education Committee
Paul Hovitz reported on the new Eastside K-8 School. A meeting will be
scheduled soon to discuss the logistics of the site.
The Committee has decided to endorse a request for seats in 6th grade classes to
be zoned for local children only (especially with the addition of the new Eastside K-8
School, thus opening seats for children in the local school district).
A report was given on Big Brothers & Big Sisters, 9/11 Response Team. It is a
mentoring service offered to all children who were impacted in any way by the events of
9/11.H. Tribeca Committee
RE: 88 Leonard Street, CPC special permit to allow a 225-space parking garage

Authority to hold a 500-foot hearing on the proposed liquor license application for M.P.
Liquor Inc. at 235 West Broadway and provide members of the community an
opportunity to address their concerns with SLA.

MANHATTAN COMMUNITY BOARD #1
HELD
APRIL 19, 2005
SEAMAN’S CHURCH INSTITUTE
241 WATER STREET
The Chairperson, Richard Kennedy, called the meeting to order.
Public Session:
Martha Gallo, a resident of Downtown, praised Madelyn Wils’ effective
leadership as Chair of Community Board #1. She spoke of Madelyn’s accomplishments
in the Downtown area post-9/11 and also criticized the manner in which the Borough
President, C. Virginia Fields, took Madelyn off the Board. Ms. Gallo made it clear that
she will not support Fields’ mayoral campaign this year.
Yvonne Morrow, a former staff member of Sheldon Silver, first reported on the
need to stop the development of the West Side Stadium (pointing to the “Stop the West
Side Stadium” shirt). She then praised Madelyn for her work in the rezoning of Tribeca.
Ms. Morrow credited Madelyn for her great working relationships, especially with the
opening of Millennium High School, in the district.
Robert Rhodes, Principal of Millennium High School, also praised Madelyn for
her dedication to the opening of the school as well as the needs of Downtown.
Richard Corman of the Tribeca Organization will miss Madelyn and her effective
leadership of the Board and thanked her for all of her hard work.
Gwen Bey, a resident of Battery Park City was shocked by the outrageous
removal of Madelyn from the Board by C. Virginia Fields. She thanked Madelyn for her
community outreach and supports the 29 members who signed the letter to the Borough
President.Madelyn Wils gave a few words about her time with the Board. She thanked her
husband, Steven, for standing by her during her many hours working for Downtown. She
thanked the staff at Community Board #1, the staff at Friends of Community Board #1,
her fellow Board Members, Alan Gerson and others. She looks forward to working with
the Board on numerous issues facing downtown. She promised that whatever we have
started as a community, we would finish as a community.
Laura Starr, a resident of 270 Water Street and a landscape architect, thanked
Madelyn for her tireless leadership as a builder and designer of the Downtown area.
Dr. Michael Lunski, of Life Matters, spoke about his post-9/11 healing program.
Life Matters is a non-profit organization formed in the wake of 9/11. Their office is
located at 3 New York Plaza. They provide educational outreach programs and summer
youth programs in Chinatown.
Lana Farina and Kelley Dugen from the Infant-Toddler Pre-school Post-9/11
Initiative spoke about their organization. It is a no-cost therapy and research program for
children, 2-to-8-years-old, who lived below Canal Street on 9/11. She also thanked
Community Board #1 for listing the program in the 2005 Youth Directory.
Letricia Watler from the Borough President’s Office gave the Borough
President’s Report to Community Board #1. She spoke about the Health Department’s
overlooking of minority communities and their health issues, the Hudson Rail Yards,
expansion of the Jacob Javits Center to the north, and costly school construction delays.
City Council Member Alan Gerson first thanked Madelyn for her work on the
Community Board and her continued work on other Boards such as Hudson River Park
Trust and Lower Manhattan Development Corporation.
The Council Member then gave a report on issues facing Downtown residents:
 He spoke about the Town Hall meeting (Community Youth Forum) sponsored by
his office and Community Board #1. He is absolutely assured that every child
Downtown will have the option to attend a middle school in the community. He
contacted Region 9 about short-term and long-term plans to accomplish the task.
He is asking for expansion of the schools in the area by less than a homeroom-
class size and wishes to construct a Middle School Task Force to deal with the
issue.
 He gave a report on the construction of Telecom Hotels to house diesel fuel near
residences. The Department of Buildings is favoring variances to allow an
increase in storage capacities in exchange for additional safety conditions
(firewalls, safety drills, etc). The Council Member has yet to receive these
conditions in writing. He also has been informed that the DOB is looking to
increase the storage capacity in these buildings without regard for residents. At
the present time, the DOB has put the issue on-hold until a meeting with the
Council Member has been arranged within the near future. A report was given on the Solid Waste Disposal Plan. At the present time, City
garbage is shipped out of the area and recycled, except for Lower Manhattan
refuse. The garbage from Lower Manhattan is shipped to New Jersey and then
incinerated. With the wind shifting from the West (New Jersey) to the East
(Lower Manhattan), residents in the area get the smell and fumes. The Council
Member is asking all residents and the Community Board to write letters to the
City Council opposing this practice.
 Regarding the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, they are still sitting
on $700-to-800 million. The LMDC ruled out money to be given to Human
Services, but unfortunately many post-9/11 counseling services, including job-
training programs, are up for renewal. They need the money. Also, the Hudson
River Park is in need of money. The Council Member submitted to the LMDC a
Renaissance Plan for distribution of the money.
Nancy Owens, a Community Board #1 Public Member and former Community Board
#1 Member, praised Madelyn as Chair.

Committee Reports:
NOTE: SEE RESOLUTIONS AT END OF MINUTES
A. Executive Committee
Michael Connolly spoke in favor of the resolution, praising and thanking Madelyn
Wils. He thought that the language should be much stronger. The Borough President
should be mentioned. He stated that the Borough President has proven to be out of touch
with her constituents’ needs. He will campaign against her in her bid for mayor.Anthony Notaro spoke about Madelyn’s ability to raise the bar of great leadership
at Community Board #1.
Bruce Ehrman also expressed his deep gratitude to Madelyn.
Tim Lannan spoke in thanks for Madelyn’s work.
Jeff Galloway reported that the Borough President’s move could be seen as a
violation of City Charter. Appointments are for two-years. No such thing as a one-year
term.
Paul Goldstein explained that there is such a thing as a one-year term and that it is
not uncommon. If a member leaves the Board prior to the expiration of their term, and the
seat has to be filled, the Borough President will appoint someone to that seat for the
remainder of the term of that seat. When the term is up, the member will be up for
reappointment.
Jeff Galloway stated that it should be examined whether or not Madelyn was
appointed to fill such a member’s seat at the time of her appointment last year.
Arthur Gregory spoke about becoming a Community Board Member after moving
here post-9/11. He thanked Madelyn for her hard work and said that he will be watching
the candidates for Chair closely.
Pearl Scher expressed her gratitude towards Madelyn and told of her decision of
becoming a Board Member two years ago at the suggestion of Madelyn.
Patricia Moore directed her question towards Jeff Galloway about whether or not,
if it’s true that the Borough President violated the City Charter, the Board should take
action. Jeff responded that we would need the support of the full Board and of Madelyn
in order to take any action.
Una Perkins asked if the Borough President was invited to defend herself against
these allegations of wrongdoing. She recommended that the Borough President be invited
to next month’s full Board meeting. Raymond O’Keefe seconded the motion, which the
full Board endorsed.
RE: The departure of Madelyn Wils and thanking her
Inviting the Borough President to next month’s Community Board #1 meeting to
discuss the departure of Madelyn Wils was added as a Friendly Amendment.
By a vote of 39 in favor and 3 abstaining, the Board expresses its gratitude to
Madelyn Wils and thanks her for the many significant contributions she has made to
Community Board #1 and the Downtown community.B. Youth & Education Committee
Paul Hovitz reported that Rebecca Skinner had been appointed Assistant
Superintendent for the Hempstead School District.
The Youth Directory is now available. Thanks were extended to Mary Kate
Cudahy, the staff at Community Board #1, Tom Goodkind and the rest of the Youth &
Education Committee for all of their hard work. A special thanks was given to Julie
Menin and Wall Street Rising for funding the production of the directory.
The Youth Fair is to be held on May 18th from 4 PM to 7 PM at the Southbridge
Towers Community Room.
RE: PS 150 After-School Program
By a unanimous vote, the Community Board asks Governor Pataki and the New
York State Department of Children and Family Services to extend all the contracts of
current Advantage After-School grants that are set to expire this year.
RE: Creating additional Middle School seats in Community Board #1 for local
children
By a unanimous vote, Community Board #1 specifically urges that Region 9 take
steps to implement the following options intended to create additional middle
school seats in our district:
 Creation of new locally zoned middle school(s) in CB #1
 Giving official preference to local children seeking admission to IS 89
if they list the school as their first choice
 Establishing a selection process wherein, if a CB #1 5th grade child is
denied admission to IS 89 as their first choice, notice from the regional
administrator as to why the child was denied admission, notice as to
the appeal process, and an alternative placement in the best interest of
the family will be provided
Region 9 and Community Board #1 establish a joint advisory and planning
committee to begin determining how the new Beekman Street school will serve the
children of our ever-growing Lower Manhattan district.
Region 9 and Community Board #1 establish a joint advisory and planning
committee to oversee the planning of the new middle schools and IS 89.C. Combined Seaport/Civic Center, Financial District, WTC Redevelopment
Committees
Richard Kennedy presented on the LMDC off-site studies report. He said that the
LMDC made a presentation to the Committee on Greenwich Street South and the
Chinatown/Seaport Circulation Study. Park Row is to open in May for buses allowing for
direct access between Chinatown and the Seaport.
D. Combined Financial District, Landmarks and Battery Park City Committees
Ray O’Keefe presented to the Board about the Pier A development. There is a
new Principal in charge of Pier A, but he has run into bureaucratic problems on his plans
to reopen this facility.
RE: Bowling Green, new canopy for escalator and new ADA elevator kiosk
The new canopy is to be made of a granite base, stainless steel arched frame and
clear reinforced glass.
The Community Board was unable to see a rendering of the proposed kiosk.
Many members feel that the design was inappropriate for the location. They
would prefer a less conspicuous design that would not draw so much attention.
The Committee would normally ask the applicant to return having given
consideration to these comments, but they did not want to delay the completion of this
important public amenity.
By a unanimous vote, CB #1 recommends that the Landmarks Preservation
Commission take these comments into account when approving the application.
The members of the 2005 Nominating Committee
are:
 Albert Capsouto
 Catherine McVay Hughes
 Patricia Moore
 Raymond O’Keefe
 George OlsenE. Tribeca Committee
RE: 55 Avenue of the Americas, City Planning Commission Special Permit
Application
The applicant has applied to the City Planning Commission for four Special
Permits for the rehabilitation and conversion of the former light manufacturing or
commercial building located at 55 Avenue of the Americas, which is on the southwest
corner of Canal Street and Avenue of the Americas.
The four Special Permits requested for the conversion are (a) conversion of a loft
building with a greater than 5,000 square foot floor plate to loft dwelling or joint live
work quarters, (b) enlargement of a building containing loft dwellings within an area with
an M1-5 zoning designation, (c) to allow a community facility in a M1-5 zoning district,
and (d) to allow an accessory parking garage with 47 parking spaces (including 9
reservoir spaces).
The owners of 55 Avenue of the Americas specifically acknowledged and agreed
that if the requested Special Permits for conversion and enlargement of the building are
granted (a) they will appoint a neighborhood construction liaison to address concerns of
neighboring residents, (b) they will not apply for a permit to work after hours or on
weekends except in the case where the work is deemed too dangerous by the Department
of Buildings to be scheduled during regular work hours such as crane installations, and
(c) they will work with the New York City Department of Transportation to arrange for
the installation of improved traffic safety equipment and signage in the area, and
particularly on York Street and St. John’s Lane, which will both be used for access to the
building and proposed accessory parking garage.
They also agreed that if the requested Special Permit for Accessory Parking is
granted the proposed accessory parking garage will be used in accordance with such
Special Permit only for accessory parking for occupants of 55 Avenue of the Americas
and their guests and in strict compliance with any other conditions imposed by the City
Planning Commission. They will not seek a license from the Department of Consumer
Affairs or any other agency to operate a transient or permanent public parking garage in
the building and the proposed accessory parking garage will not be used for transient or
permanent public parking under any circumstances
Community members including residents of nearby buildings expressed strong
concerns about traffic disruption and pedestrian safety issues along Avenue of the
Americas, York Street and St. John’s Lane that may result from the proposed project as
well as noise and dust generated from the construction site.Paul Yeager, a resident in the area, testified in opposition to the proposal. He does
not think that the glass “tower” is fitting in the surrounding area. He also believes that the
site will pose a traffic hazard to vehicles and pedestrians in an already busy area (there is
already a hotel with a parking garage located within its property in the immediate area).
Regarding the zoning change proposal, Mr. Yeager brought it to the Board’s attention
that the height of the building will, in fact, be higher than what is stated in their proposal.
By a vote of 36 in favor, 4 opposed, and 2 abstentions, the Board does not object
to the conversion of the building at 55 Avenue of the Americas to loft dwellings.
Community Board #1 does not object to the enlargement of this manufacturing building
containing loft dwellings despite the fact that it is located in an M1-5 zoning district
subject to compliance with conditions and limitations as the City Planning Commission
deems necessary. Also, the Board does not object to the granting of a Special Permit by
the City Planning Commission for an attended accessory parking garage with a maximum
capacity of 47 parking spaces (including 9 reservoir spaces).
Community Board #1, while not objecting to allowing a community facility in the
building, which thereby creates additional allowable floor area in the building, has
concerns about the proposed height of the new addition to be created, and therefore
requests that the Department of City Planning evaluate the height of the proposed
building at 150 feet in light of the Community Board’s possible future proposal to change
the M1-5 zoning district to a C6-2A zoning district with a 120 foot height limit.
In furtherance, while the Board expects the developer will successfully retain
Chinese American Planning Council to occupy the space, the Board asks that the
applicant work with them if the City Planning Commission plan does not go through.
F. Waterfront Committee
Linda Roche gave a report on the status of the Governors Island RFP. She
reported that Jim Lima, the President of GIPEC, has resigned. The New Globe Theatre is
interested in occupying the Castle Williams space.
People interested in receiving more information on the status of the New Globe
Theatre on Governors Island are urged to go to www.newglobe.org.
G. Battery Park City Committee
RE: 102 North End Avenue, new sidewalk café application for Battery Park Freso
LLC, d/b/a Chevy’s for 21 tables and 60 seats
By a vote of 40 in favor, the Board approved the application for a one-year
sidewalk café permit.RE: Adding additional 5,000 square feet of space to the BPCA Community Center
planned for Sites 23/24
The Battery Park City Authority is developing design plans for the Community
Center to be built on Sites 23/24. The current plans are for 45,000 gross square feet, yet a
Memo of Understanding between CB #1, BPCA, BPC Parks Conservancy and the
district’s then-Council Member Freed dated February 13, 2001, calls for a total of 50,700
gross square feet.
The Board requests that the BPCA adjust their plans to include the full 50,700
gross square feet and meet with CB #1 representatives to discuss the final design of the
Community Center. The Resolution was tabled and a meeting will instead be arranged to
address this issue.
RE: Hallmark Residence designated parking on North End Avenue
The Hallmark Residence located on North End Avenue owns and operates a
handicap accessible van for the use of its residence.
By a vote of 40 in favor, the Board requests that the BPCA and the NYC
Department of Transportation designate a permanent parking space in front of the
Hallmark Residence exclusively for their van.
A report was given on the Cirque de Soleil troupe coming to Battery Park City.
H. Financial District Committee
Ray O’Keefe reported on the 4/5 line rehabilitation at the Wall Street Station.
RE: Street activity permit for Thames Street between Broadway and Trinity Place for
Big Al’s Pizza for May through September on weekdays
By a vote of 40 in favor, Community Board #1 approves the granting of a street
activity permit to Big Al’s Pizza.
RE: High School of Economics and Finance, street activity permit to conduct a Health
Fair on Cedar and Thames Streets on May 21st
By a vote of 40 in favor, the Board approves the granting of a street activity
permit to The High School of Economics and Finance.I. Landmarks Committee
Bruce Ehrman reported on the meeting members from the Committee had with
the Landmarks Preservation Commission.
RE: 85 Leonard Street, application to legalize transoms above the door
The applicant has appeared before the Landmarks Committee of Community
Board #1 on more than one occasion, attempting to prove that 85 Leonard Street’s newly
installed transoms are historically correct, and that the transom drawings approved by the
Landmarks Preservation Commission were an error of the applicant’s architect.
By a vote of 40 in favor, the Community Board has decided that they cannot make
a recommendation to the Landmarks Preservation Commission regarding the transom
legalization because the Board simply cannot establish an appropriate historical record.
RE: 143 Franklin Street, application to install transformer vault in sidewalk
The applicant failed to attend the meeting.
CB #1 recommends that the Landmarks Preservation Commission holdover the
application until CB #1 is given the opportunity to review the proposal.
RE: 401 Washington Street, application to legalize thoroseal used on building façade
The thoroseal was applied to a very large and visible section of the parapet wall
over the faded painting of the name of the building’s former occupant – Heller & Usdan
Paper Company.
Significant damage to the brickwork would occur if the thoroseal were now to be
removed. The applicant had sought the advice of the Landmarks Conservancy.
The Committee agreed with the Landmarks Conservancy’s advice to carefully
paint over the thoroseal to match the brick color of the faded sign.
By a vote of 40 in favor, CB #1 recommends that the Landmarks Preservation
Commission approve the application.
RE: 277 Water Street, application to install new handicap ramp and new storefront
façade.
One element of this application is a new storefront to replace 277 Water Street’s
existing, long-ruined street-level façade, located a few steps away from the Brooklyn
Bridge anchorage. The application’s other element is a handicapped-accessible ramp witha simple tubular railing, replacing but of the same width as, and visually less intrusive
than, an existing concrete slab in front of the building.
By a vote of 40 in favor, Community Board #1 agrees with the architect that this
good proposal would be further enhanced by the applicant’s desire for the storefront
treatment and recommends that the Landmarks Preservation Commission approve both
parts of this application.
RE: 363 Greenwich Street, application to legalize air conditioning unit installed
without LPC permits
By a vote of 40 in favor, the Board defers to the Landmarks Preservation
Commission’s judgment of this application.
RE: 127 Fulton Street, Keuffel and Esser Building
The “K&E” building was built in 1893 by De Lemos & Cordes, for the company
that made mechanical pencils and drafting equipment.
The use of arches, banded decoration and wonderful detailing and metal work is a
signature of De Lemos & Cordes who also designed the nearby Fulton Building, Macy’s
Herald Square store and the palatial Siegel- Cooper store on Sixth Avenue and 18th
Street.
By a vote of 40 in favor, the Board recommends that the Landmarks Preservation
Commission urgently approve this building as an individual landmark.
J. Seaport/Civic Center Committee
RE: 21-23 Peck Slip, sidewalk café renewal application for Lemage, d/b/a Quartino
for 10 tables with 24 seats – Resolution

approve a liquor license for 18 Murray Street until the applicant presents this application
before the Tribeca Licensing Task Force.

Company, d/b/a “Vino Vino”
By a vote of 36 in favor and 1 abstention, the Board does not oppose the new
wine license application for Firehouse Wine Co, d/b/a “Vino Vino” for a period of two
years.
RE: 222 West Broadway, sidewalk café renewal application for Franklin Street Station

sidewalk café license renewal for Franklin Station Café at 222 West Broadway for a
period of two years.

RE: WTC Greenmarket
A Greenmarket has been located at the WTC site for 15 years. It is likely that
necessary construction activity at the site will necessitate the relocation of the existing
Greenmarket in the not too distant future.
By a unanimous vote, the Board strongly supports the continued operation of a
Greenmarket at or near the WTC site and the Community Board will work with the
Greenmarket to identify an alternative interim site, possibly on Cedar Street, to enable the
market to serve its clientele.
RE: Slow pace of rebuilding at WTC site
The Community has reaffirmed its position in numerous resolutions that the WTC
site should be promptly redeveloped in a manner compatible with the goals of developing
a vibrant economy and a livable and dynamic mixed-use community.
CB #1 is concerned about the slow pace of redevelopment at the WTC site, which
adversely affects the quality of life of residents and workers in Lower Manhattan, and
agrees with Mayor Bloomberg that the Freedom Tower and other buildings at the site
should get started and that current projections showing the site not being built out until
2015 is too long to wait.By a vote of 38 in favor, the Board urges the LMDC and the Port Authority to
proceed without any additional unnecessary delay to construct the memorial and
memorial museum, the Calatrava-designed PATH Station, the Fulton Street Transit
Center, the Snøhetta and Gehry-designed cultural and performing arts centers and the
Freedom Tower.
RE: Commitment to public review process
By a vote of 37 in favor and 1 opposed, the Board calls on the Governor and the
LMDC to abide by their commitments repeatedly made during the course of the public
planning process to provide significant spaces at the WTC site for:
 Cultural facilities including performing and visual arts centers and other cultural
institutions,
 Retail development including street level stores to revitalize the neighborhood as
well as underground and stores on higher floors,
 Bus parking at the site for the estimated 130 buses needed to accommodate the
thousands of visitors expected to visit every day.
The Board also urges Governor Pataki, the LMDC and the Port Authority to bring
cultural facilities to the WTC site as soon as possible, including building appropriate
temporary facilities if necessary while permanent facilities are being planned and
developed.
The Board believes that CB #1 and other members of the local community should
play a significant advisory role in the selection of cultural organizations to replace the
International Freedom Center and the Drawing Center and the location of
replacement cultural organization. CB #1 should be consulted in a truly collaborative
manner on all substantive changes to the Master Plan as well as on all decisions on
implementation of the Master Plan as it relates to the redevelopment of the WTC site
and Lower Manhattan.
B. Tribeca Committee
Carole DeSaram reported on the rezoning of Northern Tribeca.
RE: 458 Greenwich Street, liquor license application for Sublime Porte, LLC d/b/a
Turks & Frogs Tribeca
By a vote of 37 in favor and 1 recused, CB #1 does not oppose the liquor license
application for Sublime Porte, LLC d/b/a Turks & Frogs at 458 Greenwich Street for a
period of two years subject to compliance by the applicant.
RE: Reconstruction of Leonard Street between Hudson Street and West Broadway,
Harrison Street between West Street and Hudson Street and Greenwich Street between
Canal Street and Hubert StreetIn the summer of 2006 the New York City Department of Transportation will
begin the reconstruction of Leonard Street between Hudson Street and West Broadway,
Harrison Street between West Street and Hudson Street and Greenwich Street between
Canal Street and Hubert Street as part of the rebuilding of the streets in Lower Manhattan
and the work will continue for a period of up to 2 years.
The majority of this work will be in the historic district and as such granite
curbing and historic “M” poles will be used, however Harrison Street between West and
Greenwich Street and Greenwich Street between Canal Street and Watts Street are not
part of the historic district.
As part of this project, DOT is proposing to include these two blocks with the
same historic treatment of the granite curb and “M” poles.
By a vote of 39 in favor, CB #1 calls upon DOT to minimize the impact on the
community as much as possible, coordinate between all agencies and utilities to expedite
the project as quickly and efficiently as possible and to keep the businesses and residents
directly affected informed of the disruptions caused by this project. CB #1 supports the
installation of granite curbs and the “M” pole street lampposts on Harrison Street
between West Street and Greenwich Street and Greenwich Street between Canal Street
and Watts Street.
RE: 180 West Broadway, BSA application to allow the construction of a 12 story
mixed-use building
By a vote of 39 in favor, Community Board #1 objects to the current development
plans for 180 West Broadway and rejects the claims by the applicant that the site creates
an economic hardship.
CB #1 does not find merit in the applicant’s claim of not knowing the extent of
the soil conditions since to developer would have had performed due diligence prior to
the purchase of the property, and the lot is not an irregular lot, and the underground
conditions stated are similarly situated throughout the district and would materially
change the underlining zoning if variances were granted for all those with underground
tanks, subways, and similar conditions.
CB #1 calls upon the Board of Standard and Appeals to reject this variance
application because it fails to meet the required criteria for a hardship before the Board of
Standards and Appeals and is an unwarranted and extensive departure of the area’s
underlying zoning regulations and will alter the essential character of the neighborhood
as also attested by the City Planning Commission’s letter dated February 1, 2005 to the
Board of Standards and Appeals concerning this project.C. Combined Seaport/Civic Center Committee and Tribeca Committee
RE: Proposed phase II park projects utilizing $20 million in LMDC funding
The LMDC has set aside an additional $20 million to be spent on creating new
parks or renovating existing parks in Lower Manhattan and The Department of Parks and
Recreation has brought forth their recommendations on how these funds should be spent.
The proposed parks slated for funding in CB #1 are:
 New Park at Canal/Varick/Laight Streets (which had been slated for development
prior to 9-11-01)
 New Park at Leonard Street between Centre and Lafayette Streets (Collect Pond
Park)
 New Comfort Station at Washington Market Park
 Water connection for Finn Square at Varick/West Broadway/Franklin Street.
Funds were denied to Pearl Street Park, acknowledged to be in a state of disrepair,
because of plans strongly opposed by the Community Board, to replace the park with a
new residential building.
By a vote of 39 in favor and 1 abstention, the Board is supportive of the proposed
funding for Washington Market Park, the new park at Canal/Varick/Laight Streets, and
Fin Square and strongly insists that funds from this $20 million allocation be set aside for
the full restoration of Pearl Street Park located at Pearl and Fulton Streets.
CB #1 recommends that modest funding be provided for a new park, Collect Pond
Park (Leonard Street between Centre and Lafayette Streets), only if Pearl Street Park is
fully funded for its needed restoration.
D Seaport / Civic Center Committee
RE Pearl Street Park
The Pearl Street Park located at Fulton and Pearl Streets is one of only two
playgrounds located east of Broadway in CB #1. Pearl Street Park is currently in a state
of disrepair with several broken pieces of play equipment (2 seesaws, 2 spring rockers)
having been removed from the park and never replaced.
Although the Parks Department seems amenable to repair and upgrade Pearl
Street Park, they’ve been told by City officials not to do so since they hope to demolish
this park. The LMDC is currently distributing $20 million for additional park
improvements in Lower Manhattan, but Pearl Street Park, our most heavily used
playground on the east side, is scheduled to get none of this money.By a vote of 40 in favor, Community Board #1 urges that a portion of the $20
million in LMDC funds dedicated to Lower Manhattan parks should be spent on
rebuilding Pearl Street Park
CB #1 strongly urges that the Pearl Street Park be officially mapped as parkland
to insure that it will continue to serve our rapidly growing residential population.
RE: New Greenmarket on Broadway near City Hall
City Hall Park had a very successful Greenmarket for many years operating on
the east side of the park. This market was forced to close when City Hall Park was
rebuilt. The market has found an alternative location on Broadway adjacent to City Hall
Park between Chambers and Warren Streets and it will also serve as a replacement for the
farmers market which long existed in front of 26 Federal Plaza but had to close due to
security concerns.
By a vote of 39 in favor and 1 abstention, the Board supports the restoration of a
City Hall Park Greenmarket on the east side of Broadway between Chambers and Warren
Streets.
RE: 220 Front Street, liquor license application for Calli Lerner/Sandra Tedesco
By a vote of 39 in favor and 1 recused, Community Board #1 does not oppose the
liquor license application for Calli Lerner and Sandra Tedesco at 220 Front Street for a
period of two years subject to compliance by the applicant.
RE: NYC Rescue Mission Street Activity Permit
Tom Hall spoke to the Board about the NYC Rescue Mission event.
By a vote of 41 in favor, CB #1 recommends the approval of the November 21st
parking lane closure on Lafayette Street between White and Walker Streets for the NYC
Rescue Mission’s Great Thanksgiving Banquet.

The Governors Island Preservation and Education Corporation (GIPEC) and the
National Park Service are considering what uses and programs to adopt in their draft
General Project Plan and General Management Plans.
The Harbor 360 team, a consortium of distinguished education, research and civic
partners such as Cornell University Cooperative Extension, the Hudson River
Foundation, CUNY, Liberty Science Center, The River Project, the Metropolitan
Waterfront Alliance, and the New York Harbor School, have developed a unique and
important proposal for how harbor education, research and interpretation can be
undertaken on the Island.
By a vote of 38 in favor and 1 abstention, the Board supports the vision and
concept expressed in the proposal.
RE: New Globe Theatre, request for Community Board support
The New Globe Theatre has crafted a detailed plan for the adaptive use of Castle
Williams as a theatre, with plans for a 40 week performance schedule, and has worked
with City and State officials on funding and development.
By a vote of 39 in favor, Community Board #1 supports the concept for an
adaptive use of Castle Williams as a performance space for their program, and is
enthused by the New Globe Theatre’s presentation.
RE: NY Trapeze school, request for a tent to allow for winter operation
By a vote of 36 in favor and 2 abstentions, Community Board #1 supports the
request to construct a tent for the NY Trapeze School for the time period November 2005
through April 2006 only, and is pleased that the school will remain in the Hudson River
Park on Pier 40 as a wonderful recreation and destination spot for the public.

I. Landmarks Committee
RE: 232 West Broadway, application for conversion to a residential building with
facade renovation and a four story addition
By a vote of 29 in favor and 2 abstentions, Community Board #1 asks that the
Landmarks Preservation Commission reject this application as presented.
The Board believes that:
 The industrial-age fenestration on the historic corner building is
completely inappropriate, and that the re-imagination of that building’s
West Broadway ground floor should be more in keeping with the 1939
photographs of the building, and
 The bris-soleil atop the north façade of the new building is interesting,
but does not work here, and
 The Board fears that the visibility of the mechanicals and railings on
top of the building will be great, given the long sightlines that must be
considered, and perhaps most importantly,
 The new building should be either an outstanding contemporary design
that contrasts with the historic building or traditional and more
contextual with its neighbors, not the pastiche it is currently.

RE: Proposed Holiday Season Market on Old Slip between South Street and Water
Street from 11/24/05 until 12/24/05
By a vote of 27 in favor, 1 opposed and 1 abstention, the Board does not approve
the proposed holiday gift market expo at Old Slip, but could support this event if another
location were identified that would not have such a negative impact on the community.
The New York City Police Museum and the 1st Precinct Community Council have
proposed sponsoring a holiday gift market expo on Old Slip between South Street and
Water Street from November 24th to December 24th.
The north side of Old Slip is the only westbound street off of South Street for
several blocks and closing this block would have a very negative impact on local traffic.
The NYC Police Museum and the 1st Precinct Community Council are two very
worthwhile groups, deserving of Board support.K. Arts & Entertainment Committee

By a vote of 29 in favor and 1 abstention, the Board urges Governor Pataki and
the LMDC to take all necessary steps to ensure that LMDC funds earmarked for the
development of cultural facilities on the WTC site are properly disbursed for this
purpose.
Fundraising for the memorial and memorial museum and fundraising for cultural
facilities to be located at the WTC site should not be mutually exclusive and CB #1 calls
on the WTC Memorial Foundation to focus equal attention on fundraising efforts for the
cultural facilities.
CB #1 is to be kept informed and consulted with by the LMDC in regards to the
WTC site and development.M. Financial District Committee

comprising of 4-story cubes. Neighbors of the site are concerned about the size of
construction and material used for the design.

MANHATTAN COMMUNITY BOARD #1
HELD
JANUARY 20, 2004
NEW YORK LAW SCHOOL
57 WORTH STREET
Vice Chairperson, Richard Kennedy, called the meeting to order in the Chair’s
absence.
Public Session:
Pat Dillon, a member of the IPN Tenants Association, discussed her concerns
regarding diesel emissions in Lower Manhattan. The Governor signed an executive order
for low-diesel fuel, but the Governor, Silverstein Properties, and some other entities are
saying that ultra-low-sulfur diesel (USLD) is being used at the construction site of 7
World Trade Center, and will continue to be used. The reality is that at 7 WTC, only
three out of seven of the large diesel pieces were retrofitted to use low-diesel fuel. The
community needs to be diligent because we cannot trust that low-diesel fuel is being
used. Ms. Dillon requested that the Community Board urge and keep on top of proper
fuel usage at all the construction sites in our community.
Jenna Orkin stressed that we must enforce legislation because of the destructive
components contained in the fuel. Diesel exhaust is a major contributor to pollution,
which causes premature deaths. EPA regulations are scheduled to be enforced in two to
three years, nationally.
Ms. Orkin also pointed out that there are misconceptions about the World Trade
Center Health Registry. The registry does not screen or monitor health problems.
Registry data is based on patients self-reporting their symptoms, so it will not be as
scientifically valid as it would if handled by doctors. The registry is limited to respiratory
illnesses, however, there are many more diseases associated with all the contaminants.
Jason Wyner, a resident 90 Washington Street, spoke about the plight of residents
in the building. The brand-new building, financed with Liberty Bonds, is in disrepair.The tenants need help regarding the conditions in the building, which currently holds a
temporary Certificate of Occupancy. There is no heat, there are safety issues, and the
elevators are inoperable. Tenants are living in hotels because of the many issues in the
building. Mr. Wyner came to ask for assistance in getting someone to look into the
issues. The Fire Department has open violations on the building, but because the
Certificate of Occupancy is temporary, they cannot do much to the owner. The building
is owned by the Moinian Group.
Steve Schall spoke about the World Trade Center Health Registry. He said the
survey is looking to compile a database of health information collected from people
living south of Chambers Street who were in the vicinity on September 11, as well as
individuals involved in the recovery at the World Trade Center site and in Staten Island.
The Registry is conducting 20,000 interviews, but is looking to reach even more people.
Letters went out to residents, and should be received by early February. Mailing
packages out to parents of children of all grade levels in school during 2001 in the WTC
vicinity. The registry is looking for more people to come forward.
Executive Session:
The minutes of the monthly meeting held on December 16, 2003 were
unanimously approved.
Chairperson’s Report:
Richard Kennedy announced with sadness that Madelyn Wils’s mother passed
away and that Madelyn and her family would be sitting shiva at her home for the next
several days.
On behalf of the Community Board, Richard Kennedy presented Yvonne
Morrow, our liaison to Assembly Member Sheldon Silver’s Office, with a plaque in
appreciation for her valued support to our community over the many years she has been
our liaison. The Board Members of CB1 wanted to extend their appreciation for all the
many years she has worked with us for the betterment of our community, and wish her
well in her retirement.
Yvonne introduced Debra Lesser, who is the new community liaison to the board.
Debra can be reached at 212-312-1423.
The Vice Chairperson then gave the following updates:
 The Memorial Design has been chosen, and will be on display for viewing
in the World Financial Center.
 The proposed development of the parking lot at NYU Downtown Hospital
is moving ahead, and the community’s request for a lower/middle school
is being addressed.
2Treasurer’s Report:
The 2nd Quarter 2004 Financial Report was distributed to the Board for their
review. Joe Lerner was unable to attend the meeting, however, any questions regarding
the report should be submitted to the Community Board.
Committee Reports:
NOTE: SEE RESOLUTIONS AT END OF MINUTES
A. Youth & Education Committee:
Michael Koffler gave a presentation regarding the new private school to be
opened near the Millennium High School called the Claremont Preparatory School. The
school will have a full student body of 1,000 students, and plans to open in September
2005 with 500 students.
RE: YDDP REP cancellation – Resolution
In response to the YDDPS request, several Community Board members went
through extensive training and hours of review of RFPs, and made recommendations to
the Youth Bureau on programs, and on how money should be allotted. The minimum
amount to be given to communities was raised to $60,000. Last year, almost all of the
money allotted for CB1 was given to Murray Bergtrum HS, which does not serve
residents of CB1. The CB1 Youth Committee recommendations were disregarded by
YDDP.
Recently YDDP announced that they decided to review the whole process, and
have cancelled all funding allocations. Funding for this year will be given in the same
amount to the same organizations as last year. The City spent a lot of money to work
with and train the volunteers on the RFP process. Paul Hovitz indicated that the
allocation is based on census data alone, and YDDP claims CB1 has only 3% of the city’s
youth. However, Paul pointed out that parents who don’t live in the neighborhood bring
their children to our schools, and these people don’t show up as residents.
Janice Molnar, Christian Corniel, and Lisette Nieves attended the meeting from
the Department of Youth and Community Development. They said that the staff was also
surprised by the cancellation of the allocations. The Mayor is putting new initiatives
toward youth, and a new plan is due May 13. They recognize and are sympathetic to our
issue, and to the fact that CB1 serves youth that do not live in the neighborhood.
Community Board members spoke in support of youth funding being allocated to
programs that serve our youth, and not to organizations that serve high school students
from other parts of the five boroughs.
3The resolution supporting the current inequity in the allocation by YDDP. A roll
call vote was taken with the following results: 38 In Favor; 0 Opposed; 0 Abstained; 1
Recused.
RE: Site 5C Recreation Center –- Resolution
The Youth Committee presented a resolution requesting that the proposed
residential development on Site 5C, for which the developer has agreed to house a
community recreation center, negotiate in good faith to increase the space to 40,000 s/f.
Board members discussed the merits of the resolution, whether there should be joint
meetings of the Youth and Tribeca Committees on this issue, and the issue of the height
and bulk of the proposed building. Some board members feel that the current size of the
building is out of context with the surrounding buildings, and do not want a building of
that size in order to accommodate a recreation center. Some felt that the board would be
sending a mixed message that we are willing to sacrifice the bulk and height of the
building in order to gain a rec center.
Several suggestions were made and accepted by the Youth Chair to enhance the
resolution. Discussion continued on the merits of the resolution, and the message we
want to send to the developer and EDC regarding the recreation center and the size of the
building.
Rick Landman said that from procedural point of view he would like to table the
resolution to allow for a joint committee resolution by the Youth and Tribeca
Committees.
A motion to table the resolution was made and seconded with the following
results: 17 In Favor; 20 Opposed; 0 Abstained; 1 Recused.
Michael Connolly proposed a friendly amendment to remove the 5 and 6 whereas
clauses. Paul Hovitz said it is important to establish background, but will accept friendly
amendment and remove “Whereas” 5 and 6, and to replace “sizable” with 40,000 s/f in
the “Therefore Be It Resolved”.
A vote was taken on the resolution as amended with the following results: 37 In
Favor; 0 Opposed; 1 Abstained; 1 Recused.
B. WTC Redevelopment Committee:
RE: Design of the Freedom Tower – Report
The Committee was given an informative presentation on the design of the
Freedom Tower. The Committee will be meeting regularly with the developers to ensure
we are kept in the loop.
4RE: WTC Health Registry – Update

people as possible. We have had some indication that people are having difficulty
reaching the registry. They have a website and can be reached by phone as indicated in
their flyer.
C. Landmarks Committee:
RE: New rules relating to the installation of public pay telephones in areas under LPC
jurisdiction -- Resolution
The Committee supports having rules for pay phone installation, but would like
the rules to be tighter than they are. The Committee’s resolution puts forth additional
rules we would like to see instituted.
A hand vote was taken with the following results: 37 In Favor; 0 Opposed; 0
Abstained; 0 Recused.
RE: Relocation of the statue of Mayor DePeyster from Hanover Square to the
northeast corner of City Hall Park – Resolution
Due to the construction of the British Memorial Garden in Hanover Square, the
Committee is recommending that the statue be relocated to City Hall Park.
A vote was taken with the following results: 34 In Favor; 0 Opposed; 2
Abstained; 0 Recused.
Bruce Ehrmann reported that he had an interesting conversation with SHIPA
regarding the possible landmarking of the WTC site for the National Historic Registry.
CB1 raised issues with them regarding the patchwork way in which they are defining the
site. The State called us back to discuss our concerns and the fact that the Community
Board was overlooked in this process. State officials have invited CB1 to come to their
next board meeting to review their proposal. There will be a walking tour in early spring
to define the boundaries. CB would like the site to be defined as one coherent plan for
review and planning purposes.
D. Tribeca Committee:
RE: Reconstruction of Chambers Street from Broadway to West Street – Resolution.
Beginning June 2004 and for two years thereafter, DOT will be working on the
reconstruction of Chambers Street. The CB is asking that DOT take measures to
minimize the impact to the community and take the lead in coordinating with all agencies
5involved. DOT has committed to working with the CB, residents, and businesses to try to
mitigate disruptions. The project is being paid for with federal money.
A vote was taken with the following results: 35 In Favor; 0 Opposed; 0
Abstained; 0 Recused.
RE: 185 Duane Street, liquor license application for 185 Duane Street Restaurant Inc.

Resolution
There was no discussion of this resolution and a vote was taken with the
following results: 31 In Favor; 0 Opposed; 3 Abstained; 0 Recused.
RE: Proposed Development at 408 Greenwich Street – Resolution
Howard Weiss, Esq. spoke to the board. Mr. Weiss represents the applicant
Ramirez and Co., a bond trading company who purchased the property and plans to use
the space as commercial/residential space. They want to increase the building from
5FAR to 7.5, from five stories to nine stories, and allow for mixed use. The applicant
feels the variance of FAR is justified since it will not have an adequate rate of return.
Since the Ramirez family will work and live in the building they are not as concerned
about the rate of return.
Morris Adjmi of MAP Architects and Bill Higgins of Higgins & Quosbarth,
consultants to LPC, also appeared before the Board on behalf of the developer. They
presented plans for the building, which they feel shows how the larger scale would fit
into the neighborhood. Landmarks has approved the design of the building, and has
issued a certificate of appropriateness. They feel that this building is less bulky than most
of the buildings surrounding this site.
6The Committee resolution feels the hardship claims made by the applicant are
without merit, and disagrees that this is a minimal variance, and that it is needed to make
the project economically viable. The resolution calls upon the Board of Standards and
Appeals to reject the request for a variance.
A vote was taken with the following results: 34 In Favor; 0 Opposed; 1
Abstained; 0 Recused.
E. Financial Committee:
RE: Liberty Plaza new design –- Resolution.

MANHATTAN COMMUNITY BOARD #1
HELD
FEBRUARY 17, 2004
SOUTHBRIDGE TOWERS INC
90 BEEKMAN STREET, COMMUNITY ROOM
The Chairperson, Madelyn Wils, called the meeting to order.
Public Session:
Police Officer Hoi-Ming So of the 1st Precinct advised the Board that he is retiring after
many years of service to this community. He introduced his replacement, Police Officer
Rudolph, who will be taking over the post as Community Liaison. Officer Rudolph introduced
himself to board members, and asked that we contact him if we have any concerns regarding the
community.
Steven Schall, community outreach consultant for the WTC Health Registry, wanted to
remind everyone about the health registry survey, and the need for more resident participation.
Mr. Schall is urging everyone to call the registry.
Florence Daniels, St. Margaret House resident, spoke to the Board and circulated
petitions regarding the burden on senior citizens to pay for prescription drugs and saving
Medicare, and the need to help save rent stabilization and rent control.
Robin Forst from Alan Gerson’s office announced that the Councilperson is planning to
hold a meeting regarding insurance issues and the cost of insurance for individuals, businesses,
and residential communities. Details will be forthcoming.
Executive Session:
The minutes of the monthly meeting held on January 20, 2004 were unanimously
approved.Chairperson’s Report:
 The WTC/Silverstein case will determine, for insurance purposes, whether the September 11
attack is considered to be one event or two events. If Silverstein loses this case then two
other related cases will be withdrawn, but if he wins, the other two will go forward.
 Chairperson Wils went to Washington and met with the New York delegation to lobby for
Liberty Bonds to be used for redevelopment of the WTC site. Under current circumstances,
there will be a financial shortfall to rebuild the WTC, even if the September 11 attack is
categorized as two events for insurance purposes. Therefore, Lower Manhattan will need
Liberty bonds to pay for the rebuilding no matter what the Silverstein insurance matter
outcome.
 The WTC Memorial design continues to be reviewed. A big issue in the design is still the 18-
foot wall on West Street that makes public access difficult. Julie Menin says the jury was not
told about the wall, and acknowledges that it does present a severe connectivity issue.
 The LMDC has sent out a press release indicating the cultural organizations on their short list
for inclusion in the plan. The list does not preclude other appropriate cultural organizations
from being considered.
 Chairperson Wils met with Goldman Sachs to discuss their desire to build a new headquarters
at Site 26 in Battery Park City. Goldman Sachs would like to be a good member of the
community, and would like to work with the Community Board. They are requesting an
expedited ULRUP process, and will come to the Board with preliminary designs. Battery
Park City Authority has requested a 75,000-s/f public space in or on the property as part of
their design.
 Certification at 5C has been delayed again, but we expect it to be certified next week. We are
putting a strategy together and will have a public meeting.
 Chairperson Wils received a resignation letter from board member Bob Grassi. Additionally,
fellow Board Member Bernie D’Orazio has decided not to seek another term.
 A meeting was held to discuss the overcrowding in P.S. 234, how we might contain
variances, the current P.S./I.S. 89 student body, and growth in the downtown area. We
continue to look for a site for a new K-8 grade school for Lower Manhattan.
 We met with Andy Salkin of DOT and representatives of Citigroup regarding black cars.
DOT agreed to implement the agreement reached in 2000, which allows the black cars to
service people at Citigroup on Greenwich Street without being ticketed. New signs will be
posted by DOT to allow TLC during certain hours.
2Committee Reports:
A. Executive Committee:
The City is proposing changes to the current Cabaret Law, and came to the committee to
ask for feedback once they put out their proposal. The committee expressed concerns regarding
noise levels and unruly people outside the night spots. The City is seeking to draft a proposal that
takes the community concerns into account.
B. WTC Redevelopment Committee:
RE: Fulton Street Transit Hub – Resolution
The resolution supports the proposed transit hub, and includes the committee’s desire to
have the 92nd St. Y built in, or on top of, the transit hub. Board member Michael Connelly
requested that the committee chair accept a friendly amendment to remove the 92nd St. Y
reference, as the hub is supposed to allow light and air--building the Y on top of the hub would
cause the design to change. Chairperson Wils noted that there are many ways to create light for
the hub and still build on top of the hub.
The question was called and seconded for a vote on removing the reference to the Y with
the following results: 13 In Favor; 6 Opposed; 4 Abstained; and 1 Recused. The motion did not
carry.
Further discussion ensued regarding the design, and the committee chair agreed to amend
the first BIFRT to remove “while opposing a commercial tower above the Fulton Transit Hub”,
and adding the following: “above the hub while preserving the goal of bringing light into the
station.”
The motion was called and seconded to include the revisions, and a roll call vote was
taken with the following results: 22 In Favor; 6 Opposed; 5 Abstained; 1 Recused.
RE: Path Station -- Report
The WTC Path Station design by Santiago Calatrava is a beautiful design that will bring a
wonderful feeling to the WTC site. The committee will stay involved in the process, and looks
forward to its completion.
RE: Deutsche Bank building (130 Liberty Street) – Report
Tishman Spire is working to remove debris from the building. They are doing everything
they can to be careful while cleaning the building of debris and paper. We will monitor their
progress.
3RE: WTC Memorial EIS – Resolution
Due to the depth of information and the length of the statement, the committee broke
down the document into several sections.
Catherine McVay Hughes spoke on the environmental issues outlined in the statement.
She noted that diesel is bad for neighborhood, and that the recently enacted law A19a should be
implemented for all machinery to be used in the redevelopment. The three-minute idling law
must be enforced, and an air-monitoring program around the site must be enacted. The plan has
sustainable design guidelines that don’t meet current green sustainable building guidelines.
Efficiencies must be created to meet those standards. The MTA and tourist buses are to be
retrofitted for low-sulfur output. The Sulfur Law goes into effect shortly, and we are requesting
that other agencies follow the law.
Jeff Galloway spoke on construction issues, citing hours of construction, community
outreach, and requests for mitigation measures.
Arthur Gregory voiced his concern that a “czar” be appointed who would oversee all the
many parties working in the area to ensure continuity and control over the construction. This
would be similar to the plan used for Route 9A, whereby construction meetings were held for all
parties involved in the operation in order to control and coordinate the contractors. In addition,
small businesses suffer when streets close for construction and road resurfacing--there should be
some relief for those businesses.
Julie Menin spoke about noise created by the construction. The EIS Statement compared
this project to other major construction projects, and reached a conclusion that this project would
not have more issues than those of other large construction projects. The committee disagrees
with this assessment. There is concern regarding the potential noise caused by the wind turbines
Noise monitoring must identify where the stations would be.
Michael Connelly spoke about concerns with traffic, parking, transit, and pedestrians.
The committee felt that the assumptions used in this section of the EIS were baseless for the
purpose of the study. The study did not account for workers and visitors using their personal cars
to travel to the site, and therefore may be grossly understating the amount of cars coming
downtown. The committee felt that the study understated impacts they knew would be adverse.
Other transportation issues that still need to be addressed are: the need to stage black cars
underground; and traffic and parking concerns for tour and commuter buses. Right now the ramp
on Liberty Street is designed for truck deliveries, which means traffic will be pushed to other
streets, impacting the community. Alternatives for the truck ramps should be looked at, and for
truck staging on Greenwich Street. The EIS should also include any buildings that may go up in
the surrounding area, and the impact of that construction. The statement looked at traffic flow
that leaves the area to go to work, but also needs to look at the traffic flow coming back into the
area. The committee would like to see a ruling that no private vehicles owned by the construction
crews be allowed to park near the construction site.
Debra Lester, liaison to CB1 from Assembly Speaker Silvers office, advised the board
that when the prior scooping document came out, Speaker Silver addressed some of these issues,
and that this document does not mention the 2nd Avenue Subway and private vehicle parking for
construction workers. Population increase will need to be included in the issues.
4Tim Lannan discussed the neighborhood character, and pointed out that the study didn’t
look beyond the WTC area. The committee feels that the study needs to expand the analysis on
the impact of the surrounding areas.
Bob Townley suggested that Arthur’s suggestion relating to helping small businesses
during construction be addressed. The request to have this issue looked at and some proposals
put forth was accepted by the Chairperson.
Anthony Notaro reviewed the specifics about the Radio Frequency Electronic Fields.
Board member Tim Lannan requested that some wording be added to ensure that the RFEMF’s
are properly monitored, and that the results of testing be published.
Jen Hensley spoke about community facilities, and expressed concern that there be
adequate coverage by the NYPD and NYFD. Also included in this section was the potential
impact on existing schools, libraries, day care centers, open spaces, and other amenities for the
community.
CB1 expects that the LMDC and PANYNJ will continue to update and submit for review
and input specific designs and proposals for investigating negative impacts addressing traffic
flow, security barrier installations, and all other elements that will effect the residents, workers
and visitors of Lower Manhattan.
A hand vote was taken on this resolution with the following results: 32 In Favor; 1 Opposed; 0
Abstain; and 0 Recused.
C. Tribeca Committee:
RE: The Tribeca Film Festival – Report
The Festival will be May 1-9. The Family Street Fair on Greenwich Street will be on
May 8th. The fair will include the use of more side streets to mitigate congestion. The festival
will have the same format as last year, and they will soon have a new web site set up.
RE: Tribeca Organization branding campaign and events – Report.
Sharon Frances-Moore, Executive Director of the Tribeca Organization, announced four
events coming up in March. The weekend of March 6, 2-4 pm, there will be a concert series at
the Tribeca Rooftop. A singles event in conjunction with the Tribeca Grand Hotel will be
announced, events for students to speak about work, find a job, and other related areas, and a
series of family fun events. There will be other events that will be posted on the Tribeca
Organization’s web site.
RE: 374 Greenwich Street, restaurant wine license for Hana Sushi America – Resolution
This application is for a 74-person, 19-table restaurant that will operate within the
requested timeframe of the Community Board. The committee does not oppose the application,
and a vote was taken with the following results: 30 In Favor; 1 Opposed, 2 Abstained; and 0
Recused.
5RE: 385 Greenwich Street, liquor license application for Ivy’s Bistro – Resolution
The application agreed to abide by the Community Board’s guidelines, and the
committee does not oppose the application. A vote was taken with the following results: 30 In
Favor; 1 Opposed; 2 Abstained; 0 Recused.
D. Landmarks Committee:
RE: 302 Canal Street, application to legalize storefront constructed without Landmarks
Preservation Commission approval – Resolution
The application was rejected by the commission, and therefore withdrawn by the
committee.
RE: Wall Street, Exchange Place, New Street and Broad Street, application for a Master Plan
governing the future installation of security devices and streetscape improvements – Resolution
This resolution pertains to the proposed security measures for the Financial District to
include new streetscapes, security sectors, embedded portal bollards at various streets around the
NYSE and other streets, and generally improved design of the entire area. The committee
believes the plan to be a great improvement to the quality of life in the Financial District, and
requests that the Community Board be afforded timely review of all improvement proposals to
the area. A vote was taken on Master Plan with the following results: 30 In Favor; 0 Opposed; 1
Abstained; and 0 Recused.
RE: John St/Maiden Lane – Report
SHIPA, the New York State Agency in charge of State historical designation, was
originally scheduled to come before the Board. Due to a scheduling mix-up and a need to
delineate the issues involved, their attendance has been moved back. Bruce will put together an
outline of issues involved for the Board and we will then have SHIPA speak to the issues.
E. Youth & Education Committee:
RE: Funding of local youth programs – Report on meeting with DYCD officials.
A meeting was held with the Department of Youth Services regarding the recent DYS
cuts to youth funding, and the effects to our community. The issue remains open at this point,
with no promise for additional funding.
A new RFP process is being developed by the DYCD. Mayor Bloomberg has decided to
pull resources from various funding streams and pool monies together, forming a new project
called Out of School Project. CB1 will be invited to attend a joint Youth Services Committee.
There will be a community summit scheduled for early March at Baruch College. If communities
want a voice in the process, they must get in touch with the Mayor’s Office. A report is
scheduled to be completed on May 15 in response to the Mayor suggestions on the RFP process
and how it should be structured. The Mayor will have final input, with funding to range between
$60 to $65 million. The agency claims there is nothing they can do about underreporting of youth
in CB1 due to census data.
6RE: The CB1 Youth Fair
The Youth Fair is scheduled to be held on March 25 in the Community Room at Southbridge
Towers from 4 pm to 7 pm

The bridge and elevator is operated by Brookfield Properties, and we are having dialogue with
them on maintenance.
RE: Community Center at Stuyvesant High School.
Community Center operations have been taken over by the Battery Park City Parks
Conservancy. The center is open evenings and weekends, with new programming being
implemented.
G. Waterfront Committee:
RE: Proposed interim park uses on Pier 40 – Resolution
The proposed interim uses on Pier 40 were submitted by the HRPT, and meet the
requirements in the Hudson River Park Act for fifty percent open space. The Committee supports
the plan, and supports CB#2 who voted to support the plan. A roll call vote was taken with the
following results: 32 In Favor; 0 Opposed; 0 Abstained; and 0 Recused.
RE: Proposal for a temporary covering of the NY Trapeze School – Report
The owners of the Trapeze School came before the committee to discuss the idea of
creating a temporary cover for the trapeze in extremely hot, sunny, or rainy weather. The
discussion of a cover centered on the issue of view corridors and the community’s concern that a
cover would create a barrier to the park. The owners took that information away to review their
request, and how they could work with the community concerns.
H. Seaport/Civic Center Committee:
RE: Street Activity Permits for 2004 – Report
The Committee reviewed several street activity permit requests, and approved all but one
permit for Hoop It Up, due to problems in the past years with this event. The committee requests
that better supervision and security be implemented for this event. Rick Landman requested that
the full community board vote on street fairs.
RE: Local parking problems – Update
The Community Board as been in discussion with the NYPD, and has worked out a
compromise regarding double-parking around Beekman Street and outside 100 Gold Street.
7RE: Brooklyn Bridge Park – Update

Bridge. The park will be paid for by funds from the LMDC, in conjunction with the park
revitalization plan for parks throughout Lower Manhattan. The Committee will have more to
report at the next board meeting.

ASSEMBLY HEARING ROOM, 19TH FLOOR
Chairperson, Madelyn Wils, called the meeting to order.
Public Session:
Carsten Borhemahn, Virginia Blanco, and Ben Zgodny came before the board to
talk about Falun Gong, a Chinese spiritual practice. Their group offers free Chinese
exercises and shows films in Chinatown, and they would like to extend an invitation to
the Lower Manhattan community. They alerted the Board of incidents against the
practitioners of Falun Gong. The Chinese government is against this organization and
promotes hatred against the group.
Ellen Pearson spoke on behalf of a group of neighbors who reside at 131-135
Duane Street, which is a rent-stabilized building. The landlord, Henry Meir, wants to
evict the tenants and create a hotel at this site. The landlord claims that building is going
to be demolished, however the residents do not believe this is true, as the restaurant will
remain intact. The residents are mostly artists, have lived in the building for over thirty
years, and have given back to the community. They are requesting the Community
Board’s support to keep the tenants in their homes. Chairperson Wils said that the
Community Board would call a meeting with Mr. Meir to discuss this issue.
Jessica Morris came to update the Board on the World Trade Center Health
Registry. The registry has interviewed over 27,000 people, and would like to interview
more. Approximately 400,000 people are eligible for the registry. Ms. Morris also
discussed a free booklet prepared by the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene
that discusses ways in which people can live healthier lives. The booklet is being
distributed to people in Lower Manhattan, but is available to anyone.Executive Session:
The minutes of the monthly meeting held on February 17, 2004 were
unanimously approved.
Chairperson’s Report:
 Chairperson Wils was the guest of the Port of Authority on a recent trip to Chicago
and Milwaukee to look at retail space. The trip was in connection with the World
Trade Center plans. The group toured several malls looking at what works and what
doesn’t, and concluded that an anchor store is needed at the World Trade Center.
Chairperson Wils noted that The Milwaukee Art Museum, designed by Santiago
Calatrava, is an amazing design, and she looks forward to having a building of his
(The new PATH station) in Lower Manhattan.
 The Board continues to work on an eastside school plan for grades K through 8.

RE: Street Fair Policy – Report
Board Member Rick Landman spoke at the Executive Committee about bringing
Street Fair permit votes to the full Board. A vote was taken at committee but failed to
pass. Chairperson Wils says that if the Board believes voting on Street Fair permits is an
extremely important vote, then all Board Members must realize that it will extend the
length of the meetings, and will require them to stay until the end of the meetings.
Chairperson Wils expressed her feeling that these issues should be taken up at the
Committee level in order to avoid lengthy discussions at the full Board meetings.
B. WTC Redevelopment Committee:
RE: Proposed train connections to Long Island and the airports – Report
Representatives from the LMDC came to the Committee meeting to discuss the
proposed train connection to the airport, and showed the Committee several alternatives.
They believe that the connection will be of great economic help to Lower Manhattan.
They expect to have budget numbers for the project by the end of April, and will come
back to the Committee at that time for a review.
C. Art & Entertainment Task Force:
RE: Selection process for cultural elements at the WTC site – Report

RE: Meeting with Bruce Ratner re: NYU Downtown Hospital site – new building -
Report
A meeting was held at Assemblymember Silver’s office with developer Bruce
Ratner to discuss the proposed high-rise building he plans to erect on the parking lot site
of NYU Downtown Hospital. Mr. Ratner is planning to construct a 50-story tower that
would house several floors of hospital outpatient care; Pace University would take floors
for dorms, their School of Business, and office space; the rest of the building would be
used for a residential tower. The Committee discussed the merits of the building, and
believe that the design is totally out of scale for our neighborhood. Other than the
hospital outpatient space, there is no plan for any community amenity. Ratner said they
would look at the issue, but did not give any commitment. The Department of Education
said they do not want to put a school on the site, as the streets are too narrow and they do
not want school buses fighting for space with ambulances. The Committee feels that the
Community Board should take a stand on a community amenity for this site.
E. Tribeca Committee:
RE: Co-naming of Beach Street from Varick to West Broadway after the Colaio
family - Resolution.

following results: 19 In Favor; 3 Opposed; 3 Abstained; 0 Recused.
RE: Proposed street fair on West Broadway from Vesey Street to Chambers Street on
June 11 to benefit the IPN Tenants Association – Report
The street fair will benefit IPN. A question was raised as to why a street fair
benefiting IPN isn’t being held near the complex, but instead on West Broadway. The
committee considered that the fair should be held near the community, but recognizes
that the fair needs to be held in an area where it will make the most money, and
Greenwich Street is not heavily populated. The Community Board is working with the
Office of the Mayor, Community Assistance Unit to use different streets for the various
fairs.
4RE: Proposed Street Fair on Murray Street from Broadway to Church Street on May
14 to benefit Chabad of Wall Street – Report

is becoming loud and noisy.
F. Combined Financial District and Battery Park City Committees:
RE: State DOT came before the committee to discuss the proposed reconstruction of
Route 9A from West Thames to Battery Place – Report
DOT will be doing this construction separate from other planned reconstruction
projects. They have funding in place, and this will not affect anything else being done to
Route 9A. They will be extending the deck over the Battery Park underpass from 9A to
the East side that currently stops at Battery Park Place, and will extend the overpass to
allow for better pedestrian crossing near the Ritz Carlton to help prevent accidents. They
will extend the road so that cars can make a U-turn to go back up north. They will widen
the sidewalk outside 17 Battery Place by 25 feet. The Committee had concerns about the
commuter buses along Batter Place-- that construction will cause backups. The
Committee also requested a greening of the promenade on the west side, and want all
parties involved to design and create some active recreation space on that site.
G. Financial District Committee:

be completed shortly. Three fairs will be held on Broadway from Fulton to Battery Place
on Saturdays. The Downtown Alliance does not support street fairs on weekdays. When
the various construction projects begin, the fairs will be moved around to avoid street
closures.
H. Battery Park City Committee:
RE: Liberty Street Bridge elevator problems – Report
The Liberty Street bridge was erected as a temporary bridge. In their haste to put
it up, the Department of Design and Construction designed and paid for a wheelchair lift
(not a proper elevator) as part of the bridge. Brookfield agreed to manage the bridge.
Because of continual breakdowns, the lift has never been available on a consistent basis.
Additionally, only people who really needed it, as determined by the security firm
running the lift, were allowed to use it. We have asked Brookfield to put up signs at both
ends of the bridge to let the public know when the lift is working and available to
everyone. Brookfield has tried to make improvements, but the construction company that
erected the lift is now out of business.
RE: 301 South End Avenue, liquor license application by Joman Restaurant, Inc. –

artists-in-residence, arts and crafts shows, and dances.

Executive Session:
The minutes of the monthly meeting held on March 27, 2004 were approved with
1 Opposed and 1 Abstained.
Chairperson’s Report:
 Chair Wils, Council Member Gerson, and others met with City administration to
discuss the issues regarding Sites 5B and 5C. We will continue dialogue until we
are able to reach an amicable agreement. They will continue to work toward a
resolution.
 There will be a committee meeting with the architects to discuss the proposed
East River Waterfront Plan.
 Meeting with NYU Downtown Hospital and Pace University to gather more
information regarding details on the height of building. There were recently
stories in the papers with varying heights mentioned and we will find out what the
actual particulars are. The building seems to be getting taller and taller through
the newspapers.
 Chair Wils congratulated IPN on their agreement with landlord.
 The CB testified at a City Council hearing supporting a proposal by City
Councilmember Tony Avella to change the City Charter to allow Council review
of B.S.A. decisions.
 Saturday, May 8th TFF Family Festival – Declaration of Independence will be on

 Sites 5B & 5C – have had tough negotiation sessions with the developer. The
resolution adopted tonight will help move the process forward. Alan will continue to
negotiate with the City and the developer to get what the community wants.
2 The CBCG allotment – feels strongly that the community will have a missed
opportunity if funds are substantially allotted to only the Airport/Rail link to Long
Island. The link is important, but he believes with proper prioritizing the Kennedy
Airport connection can be achieved.
 Housing – IPN agreement does not end the issue of affordable housing and
preservation. This issue needs to be a contingency of IPN – and will only be
protected in so far as Section 8 vouchers continue. City Council will announce an
initiative to ensure continuation of these initiatives. Shawn Donovan of HPD has
pledged to work with Alan on these proposals.
 There is an issue with City Hall Restaurant. Alan has requested a meeting with the
owners of the building to put on hold the eviction of long time tenants. Owner must
speak with residents, and work out a viable financial plan. We need to send a
message that these types of things can’t be done.
 The City is in the process of revising the noise code. Alan has made comments to the
revision that demand that the City close the loopholes on noise code decibel levels.

G. Seaport/Civic Center Committee
RE: NYU Downtown Hospital parking lot site, development plans – Report
The Committee has not been able to get a lot of information regarding the design
of the building. The developers are not planning any community amenities in this
building and at a recent meeting, hospital representatives told the Committee that they
never knew about any community requests. An HPD representative at the meeting said
they were not sure how big the project is going to be. Various stories were run in the
newspapers regarding the height of the building. One paper reported that the building
was going from 50 to 55 stories, then it was reported the building was going to be 60
stories. The Committee and the community are very concerned about the height. There
is a covenant that states that the site should be preserved for not-for-profit development.
HPD is now trying to change the covenant to allow a for profit development and allow
the developer the ability to create a very tall building. CB requests for community-
oriented space in this large building were denied while Pace University will reportedly
get 300,000 s.f. in the building for their needs. The Committee has requested CB#1
support through a letter to HPD saying that before they sign off on the project, they
should arrange for community review and input.
RE: Seaport Marketplace, future development plans – Report
8There is not a lot of information being given on the future plans of the area now
occupied by the Fulton Fish Market. The Committee has learned that future development
plans might be home for venues like Cirque de Soleil, but to date there is no definite plan
to bring in anything specific. The Committee will continue to monitor this issue.
RE: Fulton Street and East River Waterfront Improvements – Report
The Community Board is on record as being in favor of having these projects go
forward based on Community Board input. As these projects move forward the
Committee will update the Board.

was called and seconded and a vote by the full Board was taken with the following
results: 19 In Favor, 11 Opposed, 0 Abstained, 0 Recused.

Committee Reports:
A. Executive Committee:
RE: The City’s new West Side plan and its impact on Lower Manhattan – Resolution
The resolution was drafted in response to the proposed new West Side central business
district plan. The West Side plan proposes to build a total of 28msf by 2035, which will create a
glut of office/commercial space that would compete with the 10msf of commercial space planned
for Lower Manhattan. The resolution points out the importance of the planned buildings for the
WTC site with the first two buildings scheduled for construction and the four additional buildings
planned as the demand warrants. The Hudson Yards plan requires immediate creation of
commercial office buildings in order to allow for City-sponsored bonds to be repaid.
A “Whereas” was added to the resolution through a friendly amendment that refers to the
recent legal decision on the Silverstein insurance matter, and the uncertainty of how that will
affect the remaining office towers to be built downtown.
A roll call vote was taken with the following results: 34 In Favor; 0 Opposed; 1
Abstained, 0 Recused.

2C. Battery Park City Committee:
RE: Proposed new text amendment and Goldman Sachs building on Site 26 - Resolution
BPC Site 26 is currently a parking lot located directly in front of the Embassy Suites
Hotel.
Michael Ketring, Senior Development Council for the Battery Park City Authority, spoke
about the zoning for Sites 25 and 26. This proposed text amendment would allow for zoning on
Site 26 that corresponds with the underlying C6-6 designation, and would establish additional
street wall and setback regulations. The resolution sets out the details of the text amendment.
The Battery Park City Authority is pleased to have a prestigious company like Goldman Sachs
building on this site.
Architect Henry Cobb of PEI Cobb Freed & Partners gave a presentation of the proposed
building. Mr. Cobb said that Goldman Sachs choose this site in order to bring the many scattered
offices around Lower Manhattan into one headquarters. The building will be a gold-standard
environmentally friendly building. The public walkway in the back of the building will have
retail, and the Hudson River Park Trust plans to create a park area in front of the building.
Goldman revealed that they would be underwriting the full interior design of the public library
planned for Sites 16 and 17. In addition, they committed $1 million toward the new Community
Center planned for Site 5C.
Several board members expressed concern that Goldman-associated black cars would
cause congestion once the building was open. Goldman officials said they are aware of the issue,
and have devised a traffic plan to alleviate any problems with black cars backing up around the
building and onto the streets. A board member requested that there be no neon signs on the
building, and was assured that the building would have no neon signage.
Goldman officials were asked how they would handle construction on the site. Goldman
said that they follow more stringent rules, use higher standards, and use low-sulfur fuel and
catalytic converters. It was noted that the resolution asks Goldman Sachs present a full
construction plan to the Community Board.

Abstained; 2 Recused.

Youth Committee will discuss this at next meeting. The overcrowding issue at PS 234 is
addressed in this resolution, with input from the principal of P.S. 234. The Committee also
discussed eliminating cluster rooms. There would be a separate principal or assistant principal to
oversee the pre-K – K program at P.S. 234. The principal asked that PS 234 not become a
bigger school, and stated that it has worked well at 650-700 children. We are asking that the

MANHATTAN COMMUNITY BOARD #1
HELD
JUNE 15, 2004
PACE UNIVERSITY
BATTERY PARK CITY
The Chairperson, Madelyn Wils, called the meeting to order.
Public Session:
Steve Schall with the WTC Health Registry announced that there are 2 1/2 months left to
register. There are 43,000 people currently enrolled, most of whom are residents. The Registry
would like to double the number of children who are enrolled from 6,000 to 12,000. The Registry
would like to reach out to apartment residents, and conduct more door-to-door interviewing.
Rick Landman, CB1 Board Member and resident announced that besides other significant
happenings on this day, it was also his birthday. All sang Happy Birthday to Rick and wished
him well.
Joe Little with the NYC Rescue Mission shared with the board that they will have a
Graduation Ceremony for seven formerly homeless men at the NYC Rescue Mission. The
ceremony for men who went through the 12-step program will be held on July 15 at 7:30 PM,
and will last one hour. Mr. Little invited all to attend.
Matt Viggiano, representative for Senator Connor’s office, announced that a former
member of his office, Erin Mier, is now working for the Public Advocate.
Executive Session:
The minutes of the monthly meeting held on May 18, 2004 were approved with one
abstention.
Chairperson’s Report:
 The Chairperson will be attending a dedication of the next two floors of the Millennium
HS. She met with parents who expressed their happiness with the school, which is now
finished. Everyone should go visit the school in September, as it is really a spectacular
project. The LMDC is working with the Governor and Mayor to form a committee to work on the
coordination of construction in Lower Manhattan. The Committee will work on
developing a format for City and State agencies to work together. Chairperson Wils is
working to ensure that CB1 has a voice in this effort. This should be finalized by this
fall, and cover all projects below Canal Street, including private projects.
 Chairperson Wils met with representatives from the Port Authority to discuss retail
possibilities at the WTC, but they are not ready yet to give a presentation. We will
continue to ask for a major anchor store, and continue to work with the Port Authority.
 Cultural institutions were recently chosen for the WTC Site, and we look forward to
working with them at our committees.
 There is a letter in Crain’s this week about South Ferry. There seems to have been a lot
of misrepresentation regarding the project and we tried to make it clean via the article.
We continue to meet with MTA to ensure that MTA can get what they need, while the
Community Board gets what they need in order to serve Lower Manhattan.
 Thursday morning Chairperson Wils will be speaking on a panel regarding the future of
the East River Waterfront, sponsored by the Seaport Museum.
 A presentation on the London Eye was given, and we feel it is inappropriate for Pier 14
as proposed. This type of attraction will do damage, chasing businesses and residents
away from the waterfront even though it will draw tourists. This project is not in sync
with our concept plan, and we made our position clear.
 The projects on 5B/5C are still moving along. The negotiations are very time-
consuming, and we are still hopeful we will reach a positive conclusion on this issue.
Election of Officers:
Candidate Speeches – each candidate was given five minutes to address the Full Board.
Madelyn Wils in addressing the board said that she had seriously thought through asking
for another term, because she feels we are at a critical point in the redevelopment of Lower
Manhattan, and there are detailed issues she has been working on that need to be brought to final
conclusion. There is an enormous amount of time and effort that goes into these plans and
proposals, and she would like to finish the work she started and keep the Board involved in all the
rebuilding efforts. Because of 9/11 we have been thrust into the forefront of the many issues that
we are involved in today, and we are proud of what we have accomplished. We have had great
successes, such as the Millennium High School, the BPC permanent ball fields, and we won the
South Street Seaport rezoning issue to have the down zoning passed. We have received a
significant amount of respect, and have been given the ability to sit at the table on so many
important issues facing our community, such as the current negotiations on Sites 5B and 5C.
Chair Wils said she would appreciate the Board’s vote, and would be honored to serve as CB1’s
Chair since this would be her last term as Chair, and she knows there are very talented people
who can lead the Board in the future.
Marc Ameruso addressed the Board next. Mr. Ameruso stated that he felt that it would
be better if we were able to have speeches on a separate night. Mr. Ameruso cited his work
fighting against nightclubs, air quality issues, building safety issues, and testifying at council
meetings. He said he was very detail-oriented and inclusive, and that the Board needed to use the
talents of its Board Members. He feels there should be a system of checks and balances, and
separation of power, and if he is elected that’s how he would run things. The current chair is on
several other boards. He would ensure that all resolutions are prepared prior to the board
meetings, that committee reports should be written not given orally, and that all meetings would
2be open to all board members. Mr. Ameruso said that he feels that the Friends of Community
Board No. 1 not-for-profit isn’t a separate organization since they share staff, office space, phone
lines, and equipment. He said in conclusion that his philosophy of leadership is inclusive and
sharing of information. He ended by saying that this is nothing personal, and thanked Madelyn
for her service.
The candidates were allowed to have five minutes as per the by-laws, and this portion of
the election ended with Board Members instructed that they would have one hour to submit their
ballots and that the results would be announced later in the meeting.
Committee Reports:
A. Executive Committee:
RE: Salary adjustment – Resolution
The resolution pertains to a salary adjustment for the District Manager (DM). The City
recently reached a contract settlement with the union, but the DM is not covered by the
settlement.
Discussion regarding the budget for CB1 ensued, with questions regarding money that is
raised by sponsoring street fairs, and whether the CB should be raising money in this manner.
Rick Landman feels that raising money is this manner is a conflict of interest, and has raised the
matter to the Conflicts of Interest Board. The CB Chair advised the full board that the issue of
street fairs had been reviewed years ago with no negative ruling. The Chair further stated that
street fair money has never been used to pay salaries. The monies raised are used for operating
expenses, not compensation.
The question was called and seconded and the vote was taken with the following results:

details.

Abstained; 1 Recused
RE: 30 Water Street, application to legalize the installation of a bracket sign without PLC
permits.
The applicant came to the Financial Committee meeting by mistake, and not to the

The resolution requests that the LPC hold over this application.
3A hand vote was taken with the following results: 43 In Favor; 0 Opposed; 0 Abstained;
0 Recused.
C. WTC Redevelopment Committee:

The resolution was broken out by specific topics along the lines of the EIS study. Each
subject outlined was reviewed by one of the team members, and insights were given on each of
the subject topics. Recommendations were made part of this resolution, recommending that the
MTA and NYCT provide regular updates and submit to the CB1 designs and proposals for
mitigating potential adverse effects of the Proposed Action, including pollution controls, street
closures and traffic management plans, security barrier installations, and all other design and
construction elements that will affect the residents, workers, businesses, and visitors to Lower
Manhattan.
A hand vote was taken with the following results: 39 In Favor; 0 Opposed; 2 Abstained;

RE: Retail at the Rebuilt WTC – Resolution

requests that the PANYNJ work closely and with more transparency with the Community Board
regarding future retail services at the new WTC, and that they sponsor public hearings and
meetings on this issue. Mark Donnenfeld wanted to know if we asked for a major food retailer,
such as Whole Foods. Studies show that we could use one million square feet of retail space,
and we need all the retail we can get. The Committee spoke to Port Authority, and all consultants
have been sensitive to the current retailers, and will not put in direct competitors that would hurt
other businesses. The Committee Chair accepted adding words to the effect that we would like
to see a food retailer such as Whole Foods to the first Be It Further Resolved That.
A hand vote was taken with the following results: 42 In Favor; 0 Opposed; 1 Abstained;
0 Recused.
RE: WTC Memorial Center Advisory Committee Draft Recommendations—Resolution
This resolution supports the work of the World Trade Center Advisory Committee, and
requests that consideration be given to the special circumstances of residents, who have no choice
but to encounter the street-level aspects of the Memorial every day as they go about their daily
lives. Local residents are among those who escaped on 9/11 and lost loved ones as well, and
therefore are stakeholders in the Memorial, and should be contributors to the development of the
Memorial Center.
A hand vote was taken with the following results: 43 In Favor; 0 Opposed; 0 Abstained;
0 Recused.

RE: Proposed relocation of buses that currently lay over on West Street to the FDR Drive
from the Brooklyn Bridge to Wall Street – Resolution
The NYS Department of Transportation brought forward a proposal to move the
commuter buses currently staged on West Street and Battery Park to the expanse of the FDR
Drive from Wall Street to the Brooklyn Bridge. The Community Board is working on the
revitalization of the East River Waterfront, and this plan is in direct conflict with the current
vision for this area. In addition, congestion and pollution was of concern.

be removed, and the question was called and seconded. A hand vote was taken with the

East River Waterfront.
F. Financial District Committee:
RE: Proposed improvements to the South Ferry Subway Station – Report
The Committee reported that they believe this is a needed improvement, but we are
against using LMDC money or the reconstruction funds. The MTA is going ahead with their plan
to create a safer, less-congested station by erecting a two-track station under Battery Park.
Currently when 1/9 goes into the station, everyone has to get to the first five cars, and there is
only one means of access and egress, which becomes very congested. The MTA will have to cut
and cover parts of Battery Park during construction. The Committee is requesting that CB1 be
on the committee overseeing the project. The project is estimated to be completed in 2009.

high level of foot traffic. The committee rejected this application. A hand vote was taken with
the following results: 37 In Favor; 0 Opposed; 1 Abstained; 0 Recused.
RE: Establishing street fair guidelines – Report
The committee decided that they would review street fairs on an individual basis. In
addition, it was suggested that the street fair sponsor should attend the committee meeting to
answer the questions and concerns of the committee.
G. Tribeca Committee:
RE: 500 Canal Street, BSA application to allow construction of a new 8-story, 6 FAR
residential building – Resolution

shaped lot and its proximity to the Holland Tunnel. The committee supports the waiver, and
notes in the resolution that support of this BSA application should not be considered a precedent.

prohibitive.

A. Battery Park City Committee
Anthony Notaro presented a report on Goldman Sachs’ plans for their new tower
on Site 26. He stated that all four sides of the site would contain a walkway with a bridge
shed for pedestrians to use during the time of construction. The walkway would be open
24 hours a day and each corner of the site will have a flagman and will provide security.
The targeted completion of the construction is in the year 2007 or 2008.
The Community Garden’s lease has been terminated and is not going to be
renewed. Anthony Notaro stated that as of November 12, 2004, the lease would not be
extended, though he indicated that a letter from the Committee to the leasing manager
would be sent in order to express their desire to seek agreement to keep the garden there.
On North End Avenue, from Murray Street to Warren Street, the BPCA is
proceeding to develop a dog run.

C. Waterfront, Financial District and Seaport/Civic Center Committees
RE: East River Waterfront Plan
By a vote of 34 in favor, 0 opposed, and 1 abstention, the Board approved a
resolution calling for the restoration and revitalization of the East River Waterfront.
Included in this vote were comments about collaboration efforts with the Downtown
Alliance. Also, the Board desires information about the effect on traffic on the FDR
Drive, specifically south of the Brooklyn Bridge.
The Board is supportive of elements of the City’s waterfront plan including the
restoration of Pier 15, a new park on Peck Slip, and the esplanade beneath the FDR Drive
provided that the retailers are carefully selected to serve the needs of the residents and
workers of the area.The Board strongly urges that the limited resources likely to be available for this
project be utilized for our most pressing needs; the creation of far more open space and
additional destinations to attract residents, workers and tourists to this waterfront.
The Board, therefore, recommends that the following improvements listed in the
2002 Concept Plan for the East River Waterfront also be implemented as part of the
Phase I foundation improvements:
 Utilization of half the FDR Drive as an Upper Esplanade
 A Community Building featuring a swimming pool, boat house, indoor recreation,
bike and boat rentals
 A Public Indoor Market
 A significant Cultural Destination/Building possibly utilizing the Battery
Maritime Building
 A fleet of Floating Barges to be outfitted with a public facility such as a
swimming pool, skating rink, performance stage, and a green park
 A small Marina to accommodate day-trippers
D. Financial District Committee
RE: 26 Cortlandt Street, BSA Application by Century 21 Department Store for a floor
area variance to permit an existing mezzanine to be expanded by 4,583 square feet
By a vote of 35 in favor, 0 opposed, and 0 abstained, the Board supports the BSA
application for the expansion of the mezzanine for Century 21 at the 26 Cortlandt Street
location.
RE: Proposed newsstand on the east side of Broadway between John and Fulton
Streets
By a vote of 35 in favor, 0 opposed, and 0 abstained, the Board approved the
resolution to reject a newsstand on the east side of Broadway between John and Fulton
Streets.
E. Seaport/Civic Center Committee
Marc Donnnenfeld reported to the Board regarding the NYU Downtown Hospital
Site and on the interest the Board has in this project. He stated that Pace University, being
unable to agree to financial terms with the developer, has pulled out of the project.
The Community Board has asked for gym space and a swimming pool. We are
now exploring the possibility of putting the new eastside K-8th grade school in the
building.
A meeting for parties and public officials interested in this issue is to take place
on November 23, 2004.F. Seaport/Civic Center and Youth and Education Committees
RE: 250 Water Street site for a new school
The Board is aware that 250 Water Street, a site within the newly rezoned Seaport
Historic District (implemented in 2003), is under consideration for a possible K-8 school.
The Board is concerned that the City or developer may seek a waiver of the 120-foot
height restriction now in place for 250 Water Street in order to permit construction of a
school on that site.
By a vote of 38 in favor, 0 opposed, and 0 abstained, the Board objected to any
waiver of the 120 foot height restriction applicable to 250 Water Street and urges that the
Department of Education consider alternative sites for the new K-8 school on the east
side of the district, particularly the NYU Downtown Hospital parking lot space, which
lost Pace University as a planned tenant of the building.
G. Financial District, Seaport/Civic Center and Tribeca Committees
RE: Proposed subway booth closures
The MTA NYC Transit is seeking to close 21 subway booths in 16 Lower
Manhattan stations. These closures are one of the measures put forth by the MTA to close
their $2.6 billion deficit in the 2005 operating budget. Many people are rightly concerned
about the safety in subways and the personnel in these booths provide security to the
riders. The busy subway stations in Lower Manhattan slated for these cutbacks should
continuously have security personnel to address any and all emergencies as well as
address customer services. The MTA, prior to these desired subway booth closures,
should have looked into additional administrative restrictions or other less onerous cuts to
address their deficit.
By a vote of 38 in favor, 0 opposed, and 0 abstained, the Board opposes these
proposed subway station booth closures.
H. Tribeca Committee
RE: 45 Lispenard Street, special permit application to allow residential conversion of
portions of the ground floor mezzanine and cellar
The owners of 45 Lispenard Street have applied to the City Planning Commission
for a Special Permit to convert the ground floor with accessory cellar space into two loft
dwellings. The conversion will not harm the commercial and manufacturing character of
the surrounding area or have any adverse effect on the building.
By a vote of 38 in favor, 0 opposed, and 0 abstained, the Board does not oppose
the City Planning Commission granting of a Special Permit for the conversion of the
ground floor and cellar to live/work loft dwelling use for 45 Lispenard Street. The
Community Board is concerned, though, with the procedure, which allowed some floors
to be used as residential before the change of use occurred.RE: 53 – 55 Beach Street, application to amend a pervious variance that allowed the
operation of a school on the first floor and cellar to retain the school use on the first floor
but shift use from the cellar to the second floor
By a vote of 38 in favor, 0 opposed, and 0 abstained, the Board approved the
Board of Standards and Appeals’ application to grant a variance to allow the expansion
from the cellar to the second floor for the Montessori School at 53 – 55 Beach Street.
I. Landmarks Committee
RE: 377 – 383 Greenwich Street, application to amend the approved design of a new
hotel building
The new application is for a Group 5 Transient hotel; the design of which the
Committee felt is a great improvement on all previous proposals. The Committee
commended the architect and owners for their careful attention to detail and
craftsmanship, but expressed concern regarding the additions of one floor and 8,500
square feet to the building.
By a vote of 38 in favor, 0 opposed, and 0 abstained, the Board recommends that
the Landmarks Preservation Commission approve the application contingent upon the
LPC resolving the Community Board’s concern regarding the addition of one story to
result in a six-story hotel. This land use question will also come back to the Tribeca
Committee when their needed BSA application is filed.
RE: 145 Hudson Street, application to legalize the existing penthouse
By a vote of 38 in favor, 0 opposed, and 0 abstained, the Board concluded that it
could not make a recommendation on the matter of 145 Hudson Street without further
clarification from the Landmarks Preservation Commission. It was noted that when this
application was approved in 1996, representations were made by the architect that the
penthouse would not be visible from the street. Since the 1996 application, the building’s
architectural construction had been taken over by another firm, using documents already
approved by the LPC. But, the penthouse addition at 145 is quite visible from the street.
It is the Board’s understanding that no violations had been issued to 145 Hudson
Street by the LPC; therefore, there is no legalization issue to render a decision.
RE: 408 – 410 Broadway, new storefront infill
By a vote of 38 in favor, 0 opposed, and 0 abstained, the Board approves the plan
recommending that the shutters are restored, brick (not stucco) be used as infill on the
Cortlandt Alley side, with balanced or appropriate matching door (including a hatch), be
installed on the north end of the Cortlandt Alley side with no exterior roll down gates.
RE: Fulton Street/John Street Historic District
The Historic District Council is continuing to study the creation of a Fulton
Street/John Street Historic District and presented a report to the Board.J. Tribeca Licensing Task Force
RE: 83 – 85 Worth Street, cabaret license for 83 Worth Street Restaurant Inc. D/B/A
Nikki Sam
The proposed maximum hours of operation are 8 AM until 10 PM Sunday
through Thursday and 8 AM until 2 AM Friday and Saturday. Residents of the
surrounding buildings attended the meeting of the Task Force and objected to the
granting of the proposed cabaret license, testifying that the previous owner of the site had
operated a cabaret on the premises for many years and that the community complaints
about the noise and nuisance were continually ignored because the owner had a cabaret
license.
By a vote of 36 in favor, 0 opposed, 1 abstained, and 1 recused, the Board
recommends that this application be rejected based on the record of the community’s
opposition to the granting of the cabaret license and the owner’s failure to present a
detailed plan to address any complaints about noise and nuisance.
RE: 329 Greenwich Street, liquor license application for Tribeca Food Corp.
The applicant proposes to operate a restaurant in space located on the ground
floors of a residential building located at 329 Greenwich Street – with a maximum of 72
people, with 50 – 60 seats, which will include a “bar only” with 10 – 20 seats. By a vote
of 37 in favor, 0 opposed, 0 abstained, and 1 recused, the Board does not oppose the
application for a new liquor license for Tribeca Food Corp at 329 Greenwich Street for a
period of two years subject to compliance by the applicant with certain conditions spelled
out in the resolution.
RE: 130 West Broadway, restaurant wine license for Bouley Duane Street, LLC
By a vote of 36 in favor, 0 opposed, 1 abstained, and 1 recused, the Board does
not oppose the application for a new liquor license for Bouley Duane Street, LLC at 130
West Broadway for a period of two years subject to compliance by the applicant to the
conditions in the resolution.
K. Youth & Education Committee
Paul Hovitz reported to the Board concerning the Youth Fair held on November 4,

The Youth Community Newsletter is in progress.

of a seven story residential building
The owners of 246 Front Street have applied to the BSA for a bulk variance to
allow for the construction of a seven story residential building with ground floor
commercial space on the narrow, vacant lot.
By a vote of 37 in favor, 0 opposed, and 0 abstentions, the Board approved a
resolution recommending that the BSA approve the variance application put for by Micro
Realty LLC to allow for the construction of a seven story residential building with ground
floor commercial space at 246 Front Street.RE: Peck Slip, street modifications to accommodate planned park
The City is currently planning for both the reconstruction of Peck Slip (in
cobblestone) and the creation of a new park between South and Water Streets.
The DOT has presented their geometric street plan for Peck Slip to the Board for
review, which lays out the footprint for new park space.
The only change in traffic patterns on Peck Slip is to make the block between
Pearl and Water Streets westbound only since the roadway narrows in this section. The
DOT has agreed to reverse Beekman Street between Pearl and South Streets to go
eastbound to compensate for the Peck Slip change.
By a vote of 39 in favor, 0 opposed, and 0 abstentions, the Board unanimously
supports the proposed modifications to Peck Slip and Beekman Street as proposed by the
DOT and calls upon the DOT to undertake a parking study of the Seaport Historic
District in order to create additional on-street parking for the residents and to change the
regulations which have been in place to serve the Fulton Fish Market which is slated to
depart the area in 2005.
D. Financial District Committee
The four liquor license resolutions were decided upon in one vote.
RE: Reconstruction of Louise Nevelson Plaza
The design will include a reconfiguration of the plaza, which will eliminate the
current guard booth used for the security check of vehicles for the Federal Reserve,
creating a new less obtrusive guard booth and security clearance queuing area along the
Maiden Lane curb. Included in one proposal is a bump out which would allow the
vehicles to queue without obstructing traffic.
The plan would include new trees, glass benches, new paving and surface
treatments. Up light from under the trees and down lighting for adjacent buildings would
eliminate the need for additional light fixtures.
By a vote of 36 in favor, 0 opposed, and 0 abstained, the Board is in favor of the
reconstruction design as presented if the bump out of the north side of the plaza for the
security check is included. The Committee particularly approved of the concept of
providing the down lighting from the adjacent buildings.

77 White Street is highly visible at the corner of White Street and Cortland Alley,
and is being modified for conversion to residential use.
By a vote of 38 in favor, 0 opposed, and 0 abstentions, the Board recommends
that Landmarks Preservation approve this application provided that the following
modifications are made:
 The doors on the ground floor should be historically appropriate and made of
wood instead of metal.
 The historic transoms mentioned in the designation report should be preserved, if
they still exist.
 The base of the building should use brick that matches the original building, not
cement plaster.
 Visible light fixtures on the ground floor should be in keeping with the historical
character of the building.
 The roof railing should be constructed entirely of metal, not of wood and metal.RE: 363 Greenwich Street, application for a rooftop addition
LPC staff had previously approved this application at staff level after it was
certified that the rooftop addition would not be visible from the street. After construction
began, the builder discovered that the roofline is minimally visible from street level not
originally used by LPC staff. The builder then re-applied to LPC for additional approvals.
The Community Board was not involved in the initial review and approval of this
application.
By a vote of 38 in favor, 0 opposed, and 0 abstentions, the Board agreed that it is
not taking a position on this application. They agreed that LPC should review its
procedures for determining how applications are approved at staff level and ensure that
all applications for work that will be visible from anywhere on the street be reviewed by
the relevant Community Board before they are approved by LPC.

Group, LLC
The applicant proposed to operate a Mexican restaurant with 17 tables and 50
seats and a bar with 8 tables and 32 seats. The applicant currently operates Buster’s
Garage, adjacent to this location, which some residents feel is a noisy establishment. The
committee felt that the addition of another establishment on this block would have a
detrimental effect on the quality of life of the residents of the surrounding buildings. A
‘spillover’ from Buster’s Garage to the new site was also a concern by some Board
members as well as the openness of the space.
By a vote of 7 in favor, 26 opposed, and 5 abstained, the Board rejected the
committee resolution opposing the issuance of a liquor license to the Tribeca Dining
Groups at 180 West Broadway. The applicant agreed to adjust the hours of operation to

until 10 PM.

signatures from people who opposed the tunnel idea. The group has a problem with
wording in the resolution, namely “bypass”, and “short”. Also, the cost would beprohibitive. The tunnel access ramp would have to be built in front of PS/IS89 and that
would be problematic. Asked CB #1 Board members to oppose.
Bill Love – Resident BPC – Coalition of Save West Street. Opposed to short
tunnel in resolution. This is the most expensive and disruptive alternative. The traffic
effect of such a ramp would be dangerous, and access it would create problems to the
neighborhood depending on where it is proposed. Coalition has proposed solution –
rebuild equivalent of North Bridge with elevators for handicapped.
A suggestion was made to attach the previous resolution that stated the
community board’s concerns and issues for the WTC site plan.
Liz Berger made friendly amendment to the resolution – fold in last Therefore
into the first Therefore so it doesn’t get lost. The friendly amendment was not accepted.
There was discussion on the various items in the resolution, such as, amending
Connectivity to include, accessibility for handicapped, restoration of street grids, retail at
street level would have more focus up front; have a Grand Central Station type facility,
putting focus in letter highlighting issues important to CB #1; questioned why memorial
was in the back and should be done first.
Madelyn Wils said that she will put detail in the letter that will be sent with
resolution.
Tim Lannan proposed an amendment to read: Connectivity, Item 1D - Improve
pedestrian links to the WTC and BPC.
A roll call vote was taken on changing the wording of Item 1D with the following
results 12 In Favor, 21 Opposed, 3 Abstained and 1 Recused.

following results 31 In Favor, 1 Opposed, 5 Abstained, 0 Recused.
RE: Memorial Mission Statement and Program
Paul Sipos introduced a friendly amendment that the word cemetery be included
in the Therefore be it resolved. The request was not accepted.
Language in the Memorial Statement was crafted in an ambiguous way in order to
allow designers to go forward and create meaningful memorial. Desire to keep balance
and keep open to possibilities to allow designers vision to create an appropriate
memorial. They tried to be open ended in order to embrace visions.
Scott Shields – Commander of search and rescue team at WTC. Received a note
from a board member that concerned him that read that the memorial should include a
separate space to hold the remains on WTC site. Mr. Shields believes the site is acemetery; that thousands perished there and we should not throw away or hide the
horrific acts that happened there.
The question was called and seconded and a roll call vote was taken with the
following results 28 In Favor, 1 Opposed, 6 Abstained and 1 Recused.
C. Seaport/Civic Center Committee
Seaport Rezoning Report – There is tremendous support from our elected officials

which CB #1 does not support. City Planning will hold their public hearing on this issue
tomorrow at The City Planning Commission located at 22 Reade Street at 10:30 AM. We
are requesting all interested persons to attend the proceedings and testify.

Report by Councilmember Alan Gerson:
Councilmember Alan Gerson reported that he would be testifying at the Seaport
Rezoning hearing tomorrow. He had a meeting with Madelyn Wils and the Chair of the
Land Use Committee City Council to let them know he will be supportive of CB1’s
position. Recognizes the historic district is a unique treasure for the community, and the
City. We must all be vigilant due to the pressure by the Milstein group.
Attended forum on future of retail in Lower Manhattan, sponsored in conjunction
with Pace University. Emphasis on street level and arts related and cultural synergy is
supported and Alan will spearhead effort.
Alan thanked CB #1 for supporting the IPN issue. His office is working with the
City and State to develop financial models that show with LMDC and Liberty Bond
programs it is possible to maintain IPN and others in same situation as viable affordable
housing. Total number of units in this situation totals 5,000. He is meeting with tenants
and activists to move forward in working to win on this issue.Diesel Fuel issue at 60 Hudson Street and other sites. His office has been
working with NOISE and CB #1 and is in touch with City Officials. Building owners are
being hit with fines and owners want to discuss removal of diesel from their buildings.
His office is working to set up meetings with the fire commissioner to work on the issue.
Looking at all diesel issues throughout NYC.
Alan met with representatives at Southbridge Towers regarding the failure of DEP
to deal with cleaning the facade of SBT. DEP is declining to clean exterior of buildings
and his office will follow-up on commitments from DEP.
Friday, January 24th City Council is having a hearing on nine site plan proposals,
and to review both the plans and process for implementation. On January 30th at 6:00
PM. his office is holding a hearing on the redevelopment of West Street. Alan supports
livability of residents on both sides of West Street.
Alan will be attending a follow-up meeting with the DYS Commissioner
regarding the curtailment of CB1’s youth funding dollars. He is on the record as
requesting additional money for youth funding. DYS is changing their RFP process to
make it more community friendly, and not override our community providers. RFP test
will deal with substance of evaluation of submissions with both review by Community
Boards and City, and he wants to make sure community input is included. The current
review process does not build in criteria for youth community needs, and it should not be
based solely on number of kids in neighborhood. Our community is shortchanged due to
allocation on number of kids. We want fair and rationale funding for communities.
D. Battery Park City Committee
Proposed Street Repairs and Street Reconstruction Update. The Department of
Transportation gave a report on the resurfacing of streets in Lower Manhattan. CB #1 is

NEW YORK LAW SCHOOL
47 WORTH STREET
At the March 18, 2003 Board meeting the minutes of the monthly meeting held on
February 25, 2003 were adopted with these amendments.
Youth & Education Committee
Millennium High School – Update
Paul Hovitz reported that money is still being sought for the high school. LMDC
has not taken a position regarding funding. It is hoped that 75 Broad Street site will
become the actual site. Referring to his report on Reorganization of the Department of
Education, Madelyn Wils raised questions regarding variances:
 Within District Variances will take precedence over Without District
Variances. It is not yet clear whether the federal No Child Left Behind
(NCLB) policy will take precedence over Within District Variances.
 The local district, not the Chancellor, will make decisions on Within
District Variances. The Chancellor solely will make decisions on Without
District Variances.
It was noted that if the NCLB policy takes precedence over Within District
Variances, it would raise concerns for parents of local students who may be at risk of not
having a seat near home, and would defeat the purpose of having a zone school. Madelyn
suggested that the committee take a position on the reorganization issue rather than wait
to see how things play out.
Quality of Life Committee
74 Leonard, The Knitting Factory, update on improvements made to address
community complaintsCarole DeSaram reported that the Knitting Factory still must address community
complaints that have been narrowed down to five issues.313 Church Street, liquor license application for Zenana Inc. – Resolution
301 Church Street, liquor license application for Bread in Tribeca, LLC –
Resolution
Carole reported these items as self-explanatory and the Board passed both
resolutions.
Indian Point Energy Center – Report
The committee with give the Full Board another report as FEMA questions the
emergency plan and does not believe that it will work.
Tribeca Committee
Mitchell Lama housing buyout regulations – Report
Albert Capsouto reported that Gary Sloman, NYC Department of Housing
Preservation and Development (HPD), gave the committee an overview of the new
buyout regulations, and limited his comments on IPN to two main points:
1. The Sale of the Building from owner to owner, has certain hurdles to go
through at HPD which is examining and investigating the prospective
buyer and will make recommendations on the transfer of ownership.
2. The Buyout Process has been recently revised that requires the current
owner to give tenants one year’s notice of his intent to buyout, and 90
days to hold a public hearing with tenants.
Although, the question among IPN residents arose as to how HPD determined that
2/3 if IPN residents would be protected from rent increases via government subsidies, the
committee is satisfied with Mr. Sloman’s overall address on the issue.

out, carpeting was removed, and the cafeteria was well cleaned. The entire area of the
gash has been sealed off from the outside. The gashes are now being mended, and

South Street Seaport. City Planning put a 170-foot height on 250 Water Street, which
means other buildings could build to that height as well. There is a rally planned for
Thursday March 20.

amendments.
A roll call vote was taken with the following results: 30 In Favor, 5 Opposed, 0
Abstained, and 0 Recused.
B. Financial District
Raymond O’Keefe announced that Catherine McVay-Hughes is now the Co-
Chair of the committee.
O’Keefe reported on 55 Water Street, plans for a redesign, including lengthened
escalators, greenery, and a raised, cantilevered garden.
RE: Proposed farmers market at Liberty Plaza
Brookfield Properties is allowing the farmers market to return at Liberty Plaza on
an experimental basis, while urging the market to find a permanent location. The
temporary location will be in effect from June 3-September 2 on Tuesdays and Thursdays
from 8-5. The resolution enthusiastically supports the return of the farmers market at the
temporary location.
A vote was taken with the following results: 33 In Favor, 0 Opposed, 0
Abstained, 0 Recused.
C. Seaport/Civic Center Committee
Committee Chair Mark Donnenfeld reported on the following issues:
 The schedule for the summer concert series at the Seaport has been
reduced this year. Also, the Seaport brought in an audiologist to study
noise levels, and there will be better post-concert policing.
 There is currently no buyer for the Peking historic ship Con-Ed is reportedly being diligent and cooperative about checking out
EMF levels around the substation and working with residents.
D. Battery Park City Committee
Committee Chair Anthony Notaro reported on the following issues:
 A dog run is designed for the North section of Battery Park City, for the
southern two sections of the median on North End Avenue
 A redesign of 1st Place is planned in front of the Museum of Jewish
Heritage. Raised plantings and some trees from Wagner Park to South
Cove would create a park atmosphere while maintaining security.
RE: BPCA refinancing to purchase City properties
A resolution was put forth recommending that the NYS legislature allow the
BPCA to purchase Pier A and parts of the Hudson River Park Trust contiguous to Battery
Park City. The purchase would provide much-needed revenue to the City, and would
increase the likelihood that Pier A would be successfully restored.
The board approved this resolution with the following results: 33 In Favor, 0
Opposed, 3 Abstained, 0 Recused.
E. Waterfront Committee
RE: Intro 261, The Accessible Passenger Ferry Services Transportation Act
(APFSTA)
The resolution supports The Accessible Passenger Ferry Services Transportation
Act, legislation that would allow all individuals access to public ferry service.
The board approved this resolution with the following results: 36 In Favor, 0
Opposed, 0 Abstained, and 0 Recused.
F. Youth & Education Committee
Report on creation of private Middle School/High School downtown. There will
be a meeting tomorrow at 55 Warren Street, for those seeking further information. The
school is scheduled to open September 2004.
The LMDC recently allocated $3 million towards Millennium High School. 50%
of the incoming class at Millennium is from below Houston Street.
G. Landmarks Committee
RE: Historic buildings in vicinity of MTA transit hubThe resolution, acknowledging the conflicting interests of improving
transportation at Fulton and Broadway while maintaining the historic integrity of the
corridor, identifies three buildings to be singled out for preservation in the face of
impending construction: The Corbin Building at 11 John Street; 130 Fulton Street; and
127 Fulton Street.
The board approved this resolution with the following results: 35 In Favor, 0
Opposed, 1 Abstained, and 1 Recused.
RE: 177 Hudson Street
The applicant did not appear before the committee. The application is therefore
held over until the applicant comes before the Landmarks Committee.
RE: 408-410 Greenwich Street, application to demolish existing building and
construct a new 11-story building.
While Community Board 1 opposes the height of this building, the resolution
recognizes the progress and creativity shown by the architects. The Landmarks
Committee encourages the Landmarks Preservation Commission to work with the
applicant, and requires the applicant to appear before the Landmarks Committee of CB1
at their June meeting.
There was not a full board vote on this issue. The committee vote stands as
follows: 8 In Favor, 0 Opposed, 0 Abstained
RE: 115 Chambers Street, replace sidewalk and provide new handicap ramp and
railings
Due to a recent injury to a wheelchair user that proved the existing ramp to be
unsafe, the applicant is asking to build a handicapped-accessible entrance to this trade
union health center
The board voted overwhelmingly to approve this application: 38 In Favor, 0
Opposed, 1 Abstained, 0 Recused.
RE: 85 Leonard Street, application to install new storefront, and to construct new
elevator bulkhead.
The applicant did not appear before the Landmarks Committee. Therefore, this
application is held over until the applicant appears before the Committee.
RE: 211 West Broadway, application to renovate the penthouse.
The applicant wishes to lower the north end of the penthouse and add a clerestory
to the south. As the new renovations alter the sightline of Tribeca looking north from
lower West Broadway, the committee recommends that the LPC accept the renovations
to the northern portion, but reject the clerestory proposal. The committee feels that at thevery least the clerestory should be narrowed, and the chimney should not be the most
prominent part of the building.
The resolution was accepted unanimously: 36 In Favor, 0 Opposed, 0 Abstained,
and 0 Recused.
RE: 377-383 Greenwich Street, application to construct a new six-story building.
This proposal for an 80-room hotel on a vacant lot on N. Moore Street was very
well-regarded with a few exceptions: 1) street site plans were not presented; 2) the
wooden shutters were inoperable, and a fire hazard; and 3) there were no visibility studies
done for the 20’ mechanical and penthouse. Therefore, the Landmarks Committee
recommended that the LPC hold over the application until the abovementioned issues
were addressed.
The resolution was accepted by the following margins: 36 In Favor, 0 Opposed, 0
Abstained, and 0 Recused.
RE: 408-410 Greenwich Street, application to demolish existing building and
construct a new 11-story building.
On the basis of the massive size and out-of-context look of the project, the
Landmarks Committee recommended that this application be rejected.
The resolution was accepted by the following margins: 33 In Favor, 0 Opposed, 0
Abstained, and 0 Recused.
RE: 109 Reade Street, application to legalize security gates installed without LPC
approval
Because the applicant would suffer no financial hardship in mounting the gates
internally, as is required, and because there are other illegal security gates in the Historic
District, the Landmarks Committee recommended that this application be rejected.
The resolution was accepted by the following margins: 39 In Favor, 0 Opposed, 0
Abstained, and 0 Recused.
H. Quality of Life Committee
Carol DeSaram announced that she is stepping down as Chair of the Quality of
Life Committee. From now on Quality of Life issues will be dealt with by the committee
from each area where the complaints arise.
As the meeting ran late, the Board voted for all the resolutions at once. Therefore,
all of the following resolutions were passed by the following margins: 30 In Favor, 0
Opposed, 0 Abstained, and 2 Recused:RE: 285 Broadway, transfer liquor license application for H&M Bar LLC (approved)
RE: 249 West Broadway renewal application for a sidewalk café with 8 tables and 16
seats for Anotheroom, Inc. (approved)

establishment (approved if DOB rules in favor, 500-ft ruling held, and applicant returns
to CB1)
RE: 114 Greenwich Street, liquor license application for La Bamba (approved)
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned."

MANHATTAN COMMUNITY BOARD #1
HELD
JUNE 17, 2003
PS 234
GREENWICH & CHAMBERS STREET, NY
The Chairperson, Madelyn Wils, called the meeting to order.
Public Session
Tom Weiser of the NY Community Sailing Association came before the Community
Board to ask for support to bring sailing back to Pier 25.
Jeff Talan of the NY Community Sailing Association spoke of the importance of
waterfront access.
Mary Diericky of Citizens for Downtown expressed support for historic district
preservation. Citizens for Downtown is specifically dedicated to supporting preservation as part
of the downtown revitalization.
Gregory Brenden, liaison for Assembly Member Glick, came to introduce himself to CB1
board members.
Manny Cavaco, a truck driver who drives downtown, feels that it would be an
improvement to make Hanover Square a two-way street. He spoke of delivery and construction
congestion problems that could improve if the square was changed to two-way traffic.
Tim Lannan, CB1 Board Member, announced that Neighbors Against Noise is hosting a
meeting to discuss issues at 60 Hudson Street. The meeting will take place from 6:30 P.M. – 8
P.M. on Monday June 23, at the New York Law School, 5th floor.
Teresa Mitchell, representing Firehouse Engine 202 in Brooklyn, is asking for support
against closing the firehouse. She asks that people call their City Council members to ask that the
firehouses not be closed.
Robert Roistacher of the NY Sailing Association asked the Board to support the
resolution on opening up the piers and waterfront for more sailing and boating. Pier 40 installed
moorings, and is charging $2,000. per mooring this summer. Mr. Roistacher feels the cost is too
high for recreational sailing – he would like to see the town dock on Pier 25 re-opened.Gary Fagin, former CB1 member and member of The Seaport Coalition, congratulated
CB1 on the recent downzoing of the Seaport Historic District. Mr. Fagin thanked all involved for
working so hard for this remarkable victory. In recognition of the hard work and support the
Community Board, The Seaport Coalition presented to the Community Board a watercolor of the
Fulton Fish Market, which was commissioned by N. Rauam, a local Seaport artist.
Brad Sussman introduced himself as the liaison to CB1 for Manhattan Borough President
Virginia C. Fields, and spoke to the board about an initiative by the Borough President’s Office
regarding no-knock warrants. Sussman invited board members to a commemoration of Jewish
heritage being sponsored by the Borough President’s office.
Mark Williamson spoke of supporting the opening of mooring fields at Pier 25.
Jennifer Hoppa and Bill Castro from the NYC Department of Parks and Recreation made
a slide presentation for the Improved Parks for Downtown project. They have submitted a
request to the LMDC for financial support of the project that would create 13 new or improved
parks downtown. The parks locations include: Wall Street Triangle; Coenties Slip; Old Slip; The
Battery Bosque; Bowling Green; Brooklyn Bridge Plaza/ Drumgoole Plaza; Canal, Varick and
Laight Streets; and Tribeca Park.
Executive Session
The minutes of the monthly meeting held on May 20, 2003 were approved with one
abstention.
Chairperson’s Report
Chairperson Madelyn Wils reported on the following issues:
 The Battery Park Ballfields will be opening on June 26 with Governor Pataki
throwing out the first ball.
 The HRPT has constructed batting cages that are now open in front of Pier 25.
 This August three temporary tennis courts will open in the north section of Segment
3 of the Hudson River Park, and a temporary portable ice rink will open near
Styuvesant High School. The HRPT has requested funds for these projects from the
LMDC.
 The River-to-River Summer Programs have begun – 50,000 people attended the
opening James Brown Concert, with more concerts and entertainment planned
throughout the summer.
 Governor Pataki will open the Greenmarket at Liberty Plaza on June 3. All the
original vendors who were at the WTC will be back at Liberty Plaza. The market
will be open Tuesdays and Thursdays from 8:00 A.M. to 5:30 P.M.
 Borders bookstore opened last week at 100 Broadway (at Pine Street). The LMDC is providing a stipend to begin work on Millennium High School.
Architects are currently working on a design for the school’s new home at 75 Broad
Street. Frank Sciame will be the contractor on the project.
 Architect Norman Foster has proposed a new 40-story residential tower for site 5C.
CB1 has met with the developer and is on record saying that 40 stories is too high in
the context of the surrounding area. There will be a scoping session on June 26 to
continue discussions on the site plans. CB1 will need to work on Sites 5B & 5C,
especially as such dense buildings will have a big impact on the surrounding area.
Committee Reports
NOTE: SEE RESOLUTIONS AT END OF MINUTES
A. Executive Committee
RE: WTC Memorial
Richard Kennedy reported on a meeting that was held with the newly appointed
memorial jury, advisory board, and victims’ family members. Comments taken from the
Executive Board Meeting were given on the memorial process. CB1 board members discussed
the resolution. One board member felt the overall tone was good, but doesn’t want to see the
memorial treated like a park. The member would like to see all references to the memorial being a
park taken out of the resolution. Others felt that the park-like setting was very important to
include, and supported the resolution. One suggestion was to have the comment about the
remains of victims removed. Someone countered that it should remain in the resolution to show
that the community has sensitivity toward those who lost loved ones. One board member
suggested that the wording could be softer, like “a place for mourning”. A board member
suggested that the wording be changed to: “We acknowledge that those who lost loved ones need
access down to the bedrock near the slurry wall that will allow them solace.”
A roll call vote was taken and the board approved this resolution with the following
results: 38 In Favor, 3 Opposed, and 0 Abstained.
RE: Coordinated Construction Act for Lower Manhattan
The resolution supports the NYS Legislature’s proposed Coordinated Construction Act
for Lower Manhattan. The new legislation will bring a more coordinated effort and speed up the
rebuilding process while promoting safety and fairness. Mark Amaruso requested that a last
whereas be added regarding after-hours noise and street closings.
A roll call vote was taken and the board approved this resolution with the following
results: 39 In Favor, 0 Opposed, and 0 Abstained.
RE: Proposed new cabaret regulations
A meeting is set for June 24 from 2:30 P.M.– 9:00 P.M. at New York Law School to
review the new regulation. CB1 should receive a draft of the laws shortly. The proposedregulation would make it easier for cabaret owners to operate. The regulations would also make
it easier for the city to close down inappropriate institutions when they are in violation of the law,
and would enhance enforcement of noise issues and other disturbances.B: WTC Redevelopment Committee
RE: WTC site plan by Studio Daniel Libeskind
The resolution states that CB1 is concerned about proposed aspects of the design. The
resolution cites specific concerns, and states that the redesign and redevelopment be done in a
balanced manner to provide for an appropriate and sensitive memorial while also addressing the
Community Board’s critical community needs. Liz Thompson asked to add the following
whereas: CB1 requests that the cultural and performing facilities surrounding the WTC site
include an appropriate facility for recreational and performing arts spaces. Discussion ensued on
whether to specifically name the 92nd Street Y in the resolution. The amended wording was
accepted and added to the resolution.
A roll call vote was taken and the board approved this resolution with the following
results: 31 In Favor, 5 Opposed, and 2 Abstained.
RE: West Street options
The State DOT gave a presentation at Assembly Speaker Silver’s offices giving three
possible new designs for West Street: an at-grade promenade; a short buried stretch of West
Street (below-grade tunnel) with pedestrian promenades; and a longer tunnel with overlying
pedestrian access. Further discussions will continue, and the committee will take up additional
reviews of the proposals.
RE: Proposed Vesey Street Bridge
The proposed temporary Vesey Street Bridge will be constructed to run from the SE
corner to the NW corner of the intersection of Vesey and West Streets. The committee asked that
a budget for the bridge be shared, as the proposal sounded very expensive. The committee
expects to receive more information within the next two months.
C. Tribeca Committee
RE: Proposed Site 5C development
Members of the Committee met with EDC, City Planning, and the developer for Site 5C.
The site is bounded by Chambers, Warren, and West Streets, and is adjacent to PS 234’s play area
and a community dog run. The urban renewal plan has expired, and the project is now back
under City control. Under C64 zoning, the developer would like to build a 400-foot tower that
would cast a shadow across Washington Market Park and PS 234 for most of the day. The
developer has agreed to include a community center that would be slated for Manhattan Youth.
The Committee and CB1 intend to stay involved in the planning process.
Site 5B would be a 500-unit building and could be built as high as 675 feet. CB1 will be
lobbying to reconfigure these sites to a more acceptable height and density. Along with new
residential buildings, the community needs services to keep up with the influx of new residents.
RE: 353 Greenwich Street, sidewalk café renewal for Yaffa’s Tea Room, 9 tables & 21 seats
A hand vote was taken and the board approved this resolution with the following results:
34 In Favor, 0 Opposed, and 0 Abstained.D. Financial District Committee
RE: Proposed new station for the 1/9 line at South Ferry
There was a presentation and discussion of the proposed new 1/9 subway station. In view
of the impact of the redesign and construction, the Committee cannot be in favor of this project if
it intrudes on Battery Park and the renovations the Battery Park Conservancy is currently trying
to achieve.
E. Battery Park City Committee
RE: New ferry terminal in the north neighborhood of Battery Park City
A presentation was made to the Committee on the opening of the new ferry terminal in
Rockefeller Park. Over a year ago the Board approved a new terminal that will have five slips.
The majority of the terminal will be constructed offsite, and will be assembled at the site. In
order to do that, a temporary ferry landing will be placed in Rockefeller Park. The Committee
heard from several parents who did not approve of the location, which would be right next to the
children’s playground. The Battery Park City Authority (BPCA) has been asked to help monitor
air quality levels and help manage increased foot traffic in the park. The Port Authority will
arrange for a meeting with the Community Board and NY Waterways, who said they will put
many of their new, less-polluting boats on that route. They demonstrated a new GPS system that
allows them to monitor and enforce the 100-feet-out rule.
F. Waterfront Committee
RE: Governors Island
Jim Lima from the NYC Economic Development Corporation came before the
Committee to give an update and talk about the newly formed Governors Island Presentation and
Education Corporation (GIPEC). GIPEC is asking for input for short- and long-term proposed
uses of Governors Island. A letter has been sent to GIPEC from CB1 outlining immediate interim
uses that could be introduced, including: ball field use by Little League and Soccer League for
practice and games; tours of the island; summer/fall community school gardening projects; and
fall field days for local schools. Communication with GIPEC will be ongoing.
RE: Manhattan Greenway
The Manhattan Greenway project will create a continuous walkway/bikeway from Route
9A around Battery Park and up the East Side to the South Street Seaport. When completed, this
project will have created a Greenway around Manhattan.
RE: Pier 40 development proposals
The Hudson River Park Trust (HRPT) board decided that none of the four proposals
submitted to the board were acceptable and/or met the needs and requirements of the community.
Therefore, the HRPT decided to not accept any of the designs, and will build temporary openspace on the current footprint of Pier 40. The current parking facility will continue to operate,
and other commercial vendors will stay for the short term.RE: Seasonal mooring field and community sailing program
The New York Sailing Association asked that the mooring fields and town dock that were
near Pier 25 prior to September 11, 2001 be brought back to the area. Currently the moors are
located south of Pier 40, and the HRPT is charging a lot of money to rent a space.
A hand vote was taken and the board approved this resolution with the following results:
31 In Favor, 1 Opposed, and 0 Abstained.
G. Youth and Education Committee
RE: Millennium High School
The LMDC has provided a stipend to begin construction at Millennium High School, and
architects are working on a design for the school’s new home at 75 Broad Street. Frank Sciame
will be the contractor on the project. The school is scheduled to open this fall with 250 ninth- and
tenth-grade students. The entire project should be completed in June 2004. We are awaiting a
letter from Joe Klein, confirming an agreement that the school will be zoned for students below
Canal Street, and within Levels 3 and 4.
RE: Youth funding
Three members of the Committee will receive training from the Youth Bureau. Only
children who live in the district will be eligible for funding.
RE: Reading scores
Fourth-grade reading test scores showed a decline. Further testing on third-grade and
fifth-grade scores is being conducted. There will be a meeting with Roy Moskowitz to discuss
issues and new curriculum. We will work with the PTA, and will learn more about the parent
coordinator positions in our local schools. The PS 234 overcrowding issue will be addressed, and
the Committee will develop positive input on this issue.
H. Landmarks Committee

The Chairperson, Madelyn Wils, called the meeting to order.
Public Session:
Florence Daniels – Spoke on behalf of congressional bills to privatize Medicare
and prescription bills. Requested that people sign a petition to stop the privatization of
prescription drugs and putting people into HMOs. If the bills pass they would go into
effect in 2006 after next election.
Albert Capsouto – Spoke on behalf of having the lights turned on during the night
on the four East River bridges. They are currently turned off in order to save the City
money. We should do whatever we can to put them back on. Outreach to Con Edison to
ask for their help in getting the lights turned back on.
Rick Landman – Spoke on the need for affordable housing. “We need to rethink
the current 2,000 s/f minimum. Rick believes the square footage should be reduced to
1,000 to allow for affordable housing, for studio and one-bedroom apartments. The
Tribeca Committee of CB1 should take another look at the zoning and work to have it
reduced to a lower minimum square footage.
Stefan Umaerus – painter and poet. Shared his vision for the redevelopment of
Lower Manhattan and the new WTC site with possibility of developing downtown to
include a new arts and culture district. He identified the area west of City Hall, which
now has many discount outlet stores.Executive Session:
The minutes of the monthly meeting held on June 17, 2003 were approved
unanimously.
Chairperson’s Report:
Chairperson Wils reported on the following issues:
 The devastating actions resulting in the death of Councilman James Davis who
was shot at City Hall last week has been rough on everyone. Councilman Davis
was a wonderful man and we will all miss him.
 Our fellow board member Liz Berger has taken ill and we offer our prayers for
her recovery.
 Will be asking the 92nd St. Y to come before the Board. They have hired a group
to do a study, and they have sent a request for support from the LMDC.
 Millennium Hotel will be opening their restaurant in September and will do a
fundraiser for Millennium HS.
 Pace University conducted a survey regarding the redevelopment of Lower
Manhattan of people living below 14th Street. One humorous item that came out
of the survey was that residents thought that CB1 should have more authority than
the Governor.
Treasurer’s Report:
Joe Lerner reported that the CB1 budget for Fiscal Year 2003 as of June 30, 2003
was under budget and within guidelines.
An explanation for the line item for CB1 fundraising of $13,006.00 was explained
as money that is raised from street fairs given directly to CB1.
Councilmember Alan Gerson:
 James Davis was friend to our community and was a strong supporter of our
community needs in rebuilding Lower Manhattan. Councilmember Gerson asked
for a moment of silence in memory of Mr. Davis.
 Completed the DYCD allocations and successfully changed the formula for the
allocation of money to Lower Manhattan. There will be a slight increase from
last year.
 Millennium HS – has supported the high school with promised funding, placed
calls to the Department of Education to request that they amend their letter to give
access to the high school to students in our community.
 Will be releasing recommends next week on small business development
proposals, to include the smallest small businesses.
 Introducing legislation for affordable housing. The bill will be introduced this
Fall, giving enticements to landlords/owners for not opting out. Part of broaderpackage. Special bonds and other funds for redevelopment should have a
significant amount be put aside for preservation. Far less expensive to preserve
affordable housing, preservation first is the way to go.
 Diesel storage – hundreds of gallons of diesel storage in this community. He will
put forth legislation to contain this issue. Work toward not allowing additional
telecom and other buildings to store fuel.
 He thanked the NY Sail Club for providing their boats for the harbor sail.

amendment to restore 20,000 Section 8 vouchers, plus $5 million in housing for aids
patients.
Committee Reports:
NOTE: SEE RESOLUTIONS AT END OF MINUTES
Executive Committee:
RE: Community Board recommendations for use of LMDC funds in Lower Manhattan
-Resolution
The resolution recommends that the LMDC fund the projects identified by CB1 as
critical to the success of the rebuilding the Lower Manhattan.
A roll call vote was taken and the board approved the resolution with the
following results: 30 In Favor, 0 Opposed, 1 Abstained, 3 Recused.
WTC Redevelopment Committee:
RE: Proposed Vesey Street Bridge and Walkway – Presentation
Stephan Pryor, NYC DOT, presented the new Vesey Street Bridge proposal. The
new pedestrian bridge replaces the North Bridge, which was demolished on September
11th. The bridge is expected to be completed in November of this year, coinciding with
the opening of the new Path at the WTC. A walkway for pedestrians on Vesey Street
running from the new Path exit will be covered in order to keep pedestrians safe from
construction sites, and dry in inclement weather. The bridge will cross West Street and
connect to Battery Park City. The bridge is scheduled to have both stairs and escalators
on Washington and Church Streets, and an elevator at both ends of the bridge. There
were many questions and comments from board members concerning the inefficiencies
of the current bridges, and the hope that the new bridge will be built to a higher standard.
The presenters assured the board that the new bridge will be built to work.RE: West Street Short By-Pass Option - Resolution
Speakers:
John Dellaportas is a resident of BPC and spoke on behalf of the resolution. Feels
that the plan cost of $200 million is better than the plan costing $900 million. Feels the
additional $700 million would be better spent on other enhancements. Resolution is on
point and speaks on behalf of Coalition to Save West Street. The coalition collected
1,500 signatures on the petition.
Bill Love, resident of BPC, supports the at-grade proposal. There are a lot of
questions about the cost of the project at end of day, traffic flow, and tourist traffic issues
if the tunnel is built. Mr. Love feels the below grade option will create congestion, and
create safety concerns.
Benjamin Hemric agrees with resolution, and would need more answers to the
tunnel proposal. He doesn’t believe there are great benefits to tunnel, and believes that
DOT can do a better job in coming up with solutions for crossing West Street.
The Board had a lively discussion regarding the pros and cons of the West Street
options with discussions regarding the high cost of the below-grade option (upwards of
$900 million, with the at-grade option near $200 million). Other topics discussed were
safety in crossing West Street, traffic flow issues, access, and the increase from eight
lanes to twelve. The consensus seemed to be that there are not a lot of positives in the
below-grade option considering its astronomical price.
A roll call vote was taken and the board approved the resolution with the
following results: 25 In Favor, 10 Opposed, 3 Abstained, 0 Recused.
RE: WTC Environmental Impact Statement - Resolution
The WTC Committee reviewed the Environmental Impact Statement and
prepared a resolution giving comments and suggestions.
A roll call vote was taken and the board approved the resolution with the
following results: 35 In Favor, 0 Opposed, 0Abstained, 0 Recused.
Youth & Education Committee:
RE: Millennium High School – Resolution
The resolution was withdrawn because the School Chancellor sent a litter
approving the admission criteria we requested.RE: Need for new elementary/intermediate school in Lower Manhattan – Resolution
With the plans for the redevelopment of Lower Manhattan and the current
increase in the residential population, there is a need for an elementary and an
intermediate school to accommodate the needs of the community.
A hand vote was taken and the board approved this resolution with the following
results: 34 In Favor, 0 Opposed, 0 Abstained, 0 Recused.
RE: New private school – Report
A new K through 8th grade private school is being planned to open for the 2005
school year. The school will be housed across from the NYSE on Wall Street. The
school will be named the Claremont Academy.
RE: PS 234 – over enrollment and options for relieving the overcrowding – Report
The Committee decided to respect the views of both the previous and current
principals, who do not believe that a plan to build out the west side of the school building
is appropriate. In addition, they do not want to dilute any opportunity to gain a new
school that is needed to accommodate the growing youth population in community.
RE: Citywide reading scores for PS 150 and PS 89 – Report
The Committee is looking forward to working with school educators on this issue.
They will continue to monitor the issues.
Youth Fair to be held at St. John’s College on West Street – September 17th.
Everyone is invited to attend.
Combined Financial/ Seaport/Tribeca Committees:
RE: Improvements to local parks/open spaces – Resolution
The NYC Parks Department, with LMDC funding, is proposing short-term capital
improvements to 13 local parks/open spaces within CB1. The resolution supports the
proposed design plans and offers several comments and suggestions.
Speakers:
Art Piccolo – Bowling Green Association – does not think we should be
applauding the Department of Parks and Recreation for the work they are doing. He feels
Parks isn’t spending money appropriately, and believes that CB1 should work more
closely with the department in order to get better improvements.Several speakers spoke about artwork currently housed on the Coenties Slip site,
which will be removed when the park is remodeled. Below are the speakers’ comments
requesting that the artwork remain on the site.
Barbara Marks – Greenstreets, CB1 resident. Feels that local artists are being
overlooked, and feels we should acknowledge James Garvey, the artist who created the
park furniture in Coenties Slip. Would like friendly amendment to use or reuse furniture
at that site or at another site.
Gary Fagin – Seaport Coalition – Wanted to reiterate previous speaker’s remarks.
Would like to have friendly amendment added that parks agree for furniture relocation in
downtown district.
Jen Hensley – The Alliance for Downtown New York – The Alliance had
originally helped to commission the pieces, and will make a commitment to ensure that
the furniture is relocated within the downtown neighborhood.
James Garvey , artist - A lot of work and effort went into the design of the
furniture. He feels there needs to be respect for work done in the community, and asks
for time for investigating valuable work in the community.
Eric Goldman, Lolly Sullivan and Meg Sinclair – Friends of James Garvey – Feel
there should be a guarantee that if furniture is moved, that there be an agreement with the
artist as to the appropriateness of location.
Jim Gallagher, CB1 Member – Feels furniture is site-specific.
The Financial District/Seaport Civic Center/Tribeca Committees were pleased
with park plans, which will be done quickly. The Committee will support a friendly
amendment to the resolution to include the sentence, “where we recognize that the
Downtown Alliance will work to preserve and redeploy the Garvey furniture and will
work with artist.”

results: 28 In Favor, 1 Opposed, 6 Abstained, 0 Recused.

RE: 2nd Avenue Subway – Resolution
Speaker:
Florence Daniels, resident of St. Margaret’s House – Does not feel the decision by
the TA to place an entrance for the 2nd Avenue subway on the corner of St. Margaret’s
House is a good decision. There is too much congestion; there needs to be room for
ambulances and Access-A-Ride.
Board member Victor Papa doesn’t feel the City should close buildings to make
room for the subway when alternatives are available. Mark Ameruso questioned whether
the locations were picked so that the 2nd Avenue Subway could connect with other lines.

Opposed, 0 Abstained, 0 Recused.

MANHATTAN COMMUNITY BOARD #1
HELD
SEPTEMBER 16, 2003
THE REGATTA IN BATTERY PARK CITY
The Chairperson, Madelyn Wils, called the meeting to order.
Public Session:
Bob Townley, Executive Director Manhattan Youth Recreation and Resources
(MYRR) and Community Board No. 1 Board Member, announced the start of the senior
swim program and the parent/child (under 5) swim beginning next week at MYRR’s pool
located in Battery Park City.
Catherine McVay Hughes, Community Board No. 1 Board Member, announced
that NYU’s second annual air quality report newsletter is out. She urged all to read the
newsletter and attend the upcoming forum, “World Trade Center Environmental Health
Research”, to be held on October 21, 2003 at the Woolworth Building.
Noah Pfefferblit announced Wall Street Rising’s new Downtown Information
Center, which is now open at 25 Broad Street. He invited the full board to attend the
open house.
Mark Ameruso, Community Board No. 1 Board Member, brought to the board’s
attention the report last month by the Inspector General of the EPA. The letter revealed
that there was not enough information to deem the air in Lower Manhattan safe after
9/11. He requested that everyone register for the WTC Health Registry to provide as
much input as possible for tracking purposes.Barbara Marks, resident of Community Board No. 1, spoke about art in Coenties
Slip. She went to the Art Commission hearings and saw the presentation for the redesign
of Coenties Slip. She said the vote was tabled because the Commission did not realize
that the park was planning to remove furniture. Park representatives said they wanted the
park to have a historic flavor, but the Art Commission wanted to look into the new design
and make a more informed decision. Ms. Marks feels its unfortunate to let the
Department of Parks and Recreation bulldoze their way into making parks less attractive.
Bradford Sussman, liaison from the Manhattan Borough President’s Office
(MBPO), invited everyone to an art opening September 17 – 6 PM in gallery space in
MPBO’s office.
Johanna from Greenmarket came to thank everyone for their support of the
Greenmarkets, and advise that on October 25th there will be a Harvest Festival in
Washington Market Park from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM. Children should come dressed in
costume.
Executive Session:
The minutes of the monthly meeting held on July 29, 2003 were adopted.
Chairperson’s Report:
Chairperson Wils reported on the following items:
 Our colleague Liz Berger is home recovering from her illness and we wish her
well.
 Congratulations to Albert Capsouto who will be receiving an award for his
contributions to helping small businesses in Lower Manhattan after September
11th. He will travel to Washington DC to receive his award.
 The first meeting of the East River Task Force met in late July. The City will
be picking a team to work on the East River Waterfront proposal. The project
would run from the East River ballfields in CB #3 down to Battery Park. The
task force is using the master waterfront plan that CB #1, the Alliance for
Downtown New York, and Skidmore, Owings, and Merril created last
summer, and will keep the community board apprised as work on this project
moves forward.
 Tomorrow is the unveiling of WTC infrastructure site plan for the press and
for civic groups. Much of infrastructure work is being moved to the Deutsche
Bank site, including a proposal for tourist bus parking. The community board
will need to be vigilant to ensure that things don’t get lost in the redesign.
 The draft EIS statement was approved by the LMDC board. The Community
Board will have a chance to review it again, but our concerns were addressed.
 There will be a Scooping Session on September 24th on the South Ferry
Terminal, and I will be asking someone from the Financial District Committee
to read the Board resolution. The Second Annual Youth Fair will be held next week at St. John’s College
from 4:30 PM – 7:00 PM. Over thirty organizations will be represented, and
everyone is encouraged to attend.
 The new extension of the Holocaust Museum opened last night with a
memorial garden on the roof. They also have a new auditorium that we may
able to use for future board meetings.
 Millennium High School opened on Monday. This is a great civic lesson in
working together to get something done. There are now 225 students at the
high school-- full capacity is 500. The high school will give preference to
students below Houston Street, with 70% of students at levels 3 and 4,
academically.
 The Millennium Hotel is hosting a fundraiser for the Millennium High School
with its opening of their new restaurant, Church & Dey. All are invited to
attend for a worthy cause. We thank the Millennium Hotel for their support.
 The second annual Friends of Community Board No.1 fundraiser will be held
on October 29 at the Regent Wall Street. Tickets are $550., with a discount
for board members. This year we are honoring Tim Carey, David Rockwell,
and Marilyn Taylor. There will be a video of opening of the Millennium H.S.
Committee Reports:
NOTE: SEE RESOLUTIONS AT END OF MINUTES
A. Battery Park City Committee
RE: Services for seniors by the United Jewish Council
A council representative came to the committee to offer services to the downtown
community. They have Project Liberty funds for those who need help either physically
or emotionally. They are working with Battery Park City, Independent Plaza North, and
Southbridge Towers residents.
RE: Increase in rodents in Battery Park City
There is a dramatic increase in the rodent population in the Battery Park City
neighborhood. The Battery Park City Conservancy discussed methods they will use to
help address the problem. Garbage is the biggest culprit since it draws the rodents out
and gives them a food source. Battery Park City will be working with the Department of
Sanitation to help with the problem. Businesses need to be educated on how to properly
package their garbage, as they often have piles of garbage in plastic bags laid out by the
curb. We need to send e-mails to Parks Conservancy reporting rat sightings.RE: City Planning application for a text amendment to the New York City zoning
Resolution to amend the floor area regulation and mandatory front building walls
in the Special Battery Park City District
The resolution was written to cover the issue of the setback on the proposed
buildings to be built on sites 18B, 19B, and 23, and the size of the apartments in order to
accommodate more studio apartments in the buildings.
After much discussion it was decided that the one resolution should be split in two
with one resolution covering the bulkhead and setbacks for the new buildings, and the
second resolution to cover the issue of the size of apartments.
A motion to split the resolution was made and seconded, a roll call vote was
taken, and the resolution passed with the following results: 25 In Favor, 11 Opposed, 0
Abstained, and 0 Recused.
First Part of Resolution: The text amendment change as related the bulkhead was
discussed. Because the green buildings’ bulkheads need to be significantly larger than
those of the other non-green buildings, the BPCA is asking that the three sites--18B, 19B,
and 23--be allowed to change the bulkhead design for aesthetic reasons. Mike Ketting
from BPCA advised that the change to the setbacks would only be at the very top
setback, which would be larger; the lower setback would remain the same.
The question was called and seconded. A roll call vote was taken, and the
resolution passed with the following results: 38 In Favor, 1 Opposed, 0 Abstained, and 0
Recused.
Second Part of Resolution: The second text change would eliminate the minimum
size of a Battery Park City studio apartment for new development. The minimum size is
currently 550 square feet. The change would would allow more 2- and 3-bedroom
apartments to be built with the space taken from studio apartments.
Rick Landman voiced concern about not having enough studio apartments, since
we complain about not having enough amenities. Rick feels we should encourage more
studio apartments.
According to Chairperson Wils, the LMDC is conducting a housing study, and is
finding that there are smaller apartments below Chamber Street.
Paul Hovitz feels that there is a need to have minimum s/f, because if there isn’t,
the buildings can then make the apartments whatever size they want.The BPCA representative advised that the City currently has a minimum of 230
square feet. Also, The Battery Park City Authority isn’t guaranteeing that they will
actually build larger apartments--they could turn around and build a lot of smaller studios
instead.
Some wording changes to the resolution were agreed to, and a roll call vote was
taken with the following results: 21 In Favor, 17 Opposed, 1 Abstained, and 0 Recused.

RE: Proposed new South Ferry Terminal Project
The MTA is proposing a major upgrade and enlargement to the South Ferry

transportation funds provided to rebuild Lower Manhattan following the 9/11 attack. The
Community Board is on record as acknowledging that the proposed upgrade would
enhance the station, but does not consider this project to be a high priority. Therefore, the
Board stipulated in this resolution that this initiative should be paid for by the MTA, and
not with any federal funds. Community Board No. 1 would rather the money be spent on
other transportation needs in the community.

establishment because drunk and noisy patrons frequently disturb the peace in the early
hours with inappropriate behavior for a residential neighborhood. The applicant spoke to
the full board, advising that he was committed to having better security going forward.
The board was advised that the former owner retains a minor interest in the
establishment.

the Community Board to recommend approval of this application. Those
recommendations include: closing the club at midnight every night except when there is
a sporting event being broadcast that ends later than midnight; not allowing outside

concentration of bars in the neighborhood; and that the level of noise is already a problem
in and around this building. In addition there was a question about the square footage of
this space, and the plans as they were drawn up. The speakers were: June Beckstead,
Francine Hermelin, Jim Stark, Bonnie Seegmiller, Antonio Convit, Andrew Geller; and
Lucia Vail.

iron art.

Abstained and 0 Recused.
RE: 67, 94, 94½, and 96 Greenwich Street, proposal to designate these small Federal -
era row houses as individual landmarks
These houses are wonderful examples of early residential development in New
York, and are currently unprotected. The Committee feels that the research done on these
buildings was adequate to request immediate individual landmark designation hearings
by LPC with the building owner’s support.

Abstained, and 0 Recused.
RE: 32 Laight Street, application to install new storefront infill and a barrier-free

MANHATTAN COMMUNITY BOARD #1
HELD
OCTOBER 21, 2003
ASSEMBLY MEMBER SHELDON SILVER’S OFFICE
ASSEMBLY HEARING ROOM
250 BROADWAY, 19TH FLOOR
The Chairperson, Madelyn Wils, called the meeting to order.
Public Session:
Tom Hall of the New York Rescue Mission announced a Thanksgiving banquet
on November 24 at 90 Lafayette Street. He invited community members to work as
volunteers at the event. Mr. John Tesch is the spokesperson for the event.
Phyllis Goldberg spoke about the nonpartisan election issue. Ms. Goldberg
opined that politicians are running the elections through political organizations. On
November 4 Question #3 on the ballot will ask if the public wants to switch from a
partisan to nonpartisan system. If it passes, all registered voters would be allowed to vote
in the primaries regardless of party affiliation. Anyone who wants to run for office would
not need approval by party voices.
Caroline Martin, CB #1 resident, spoke on quality-of-life issues. She is asking
Community Board No. 1 bring back the Quality-of-Life Committee instead of dealing
with these issues in the specific geographic committees. Ms. Martin feels there is now
confusion about which committees are taking up which issues. She represents over 20
blocks, and it is difficult to keep abreast of all issues that concern their neighborhood.
She is concerned that no one is following up on important issues.Shelia Rossi spoke to the board as a private citizen. Ms. Rossi is on the board of
directors of the Small Claims Court, Arbitration Committee. She advised of a program in
January to educate the public on how the Small Claims Court can serve the public.
Anyone desiring further information on the program can call 212-788-0483.
Nancy Owens, Community Board No. 1 resident and former Community Board
No. 1 Board Member advised that she helped write the original resolution on the
rebuilding of 7 WTC. In that resolution, several concerns had been addressed and the
design was approved. At the last committee meeting there was a presentation regarding a
park across from the new 7 WTC site which had never seen before and the Community
Board was not given time to review. Ms. Owens would like the board to be more
rigorous in staying informed, and would like there to be more time given for input on the
numerous proposals coming before the board.
Daryl Cochran spoke on behalf of Congressman Jerrold Nadler. Mr. Cochran
encouraged everyone to visit the new Ted Weiss Building named for our former
Congressman, located at 290 Broadway. The dedication ceremony was held on October
20th.
Brad Sussman spoke on behalf of Manhattan Borough President C. Virginia
Fields. He announced upcoming events supported by the Borough President’s Office,
including an Italian Opera Festival celebrating Enrico Caruso at City Hall, which will
take place on October 22; a slide show presentation on domestic violence, which will be
held at the MBPO on the 19th floor on October 30 from 5:30 PM to 7:30 PM. Their
office will also host a photography exhibit on Latino artists.
Executive Session:
The Chairperson asked for any comments regarding last month’s minutes. Marc
Ameruso noted that his first name should be spelled with a “c”.
The minutes of the monthly meeting held on September 16, 2003, were
unanimously approved.
Chairperson’s Report:
Chairperson Wils reported on the following items:
 Sheldon Silver testified on the South Ferry Terminal reconstruction project.
Community Board No. 1 also testified that funds coming out of the Lower
Manhattan Development Corporation should not be used for a project that
would destroy part of Battery Park. The Alliance for Downtown New York
testified as well. Hopefully the Governor will reconsider funding this project
since the local community does not approve. There was a two-day procession commemorating the African Burial Ground.
The Chair doesn’t know why Community Board No. 1 members were not
invited to the ceremony. Paul Sipos attended the ceremony.
 Speaker Silver is aiding the effort to bring Cantor Fitzgerald back downtown.
Community Board No. 1 supports this effort since bringing many employees
back would help rebuild Lower Manhattan and support a mixed-use area
downtown. Symbolically it would also be a good thing.
 There was a groundbreaking ceremony for the South Street Seaport
Redevelopment Block 97 site.
 Millennium High School received $1 million from the Columbus Day Parade,
and $1 million from the LMDC. The school is still needs to raise $5 million
to complete the construction.
 There was a meeting with Peter Heany from Region 9 to discuss
overcrowding in our schools. Both short- and long-term planning for Lower
Manhattan was discussed. We will reconvene after the school authority
develops their list for new schools to be built.
 The Friends of Community Board No. 1 “Dare To Dream II” benefit is
October 29. Board members can buy tickets at a discount. The NYC Opera
and Children’s Choir will perform.
Treasurer’s Report:
The Community Board No. 1 budget for fiscal year 2004 is $188,764. Our fiscal
year runs July 1 to June 30, so this current budget reflects first-quarter expenses of
$44,574.75, which is on target and within budget. A question was asked about a $773.00
office, which was for equipment maintenance. A question was asked about the
Community Board No. 1 fundraising amount of $13,000., and what was it derived from.
There are several street fairs held throughout the summer that Community Board No. 1
sponsors.
Committee Reports:
NOTE: SEE RESOLUTIONS AT END OF MINUTES
A. Executive Committee
RE: FY 2005 Capital and Expense Budget requests – Resolution
The Community Board recommends implementing the Prioritized Budget
Requests for FY 2005 as stated in the resolution.
A roll call vote was taken with the following results: 39 In Favor, 0 Opposed, 0
Abstained, and 0 Recused.
RE: Co-Naming streets for 9/11 victims – ResolutionThe resolution recommends that co-naming of streets be held in abeyance until
the memorial design process is completed and a plan for commemorating victims of 9/11
is announced.
The board members discussed the pros and cons of co-naming streets. Comments
included a feeling that if the co-naming were restricted to those residents who lived in the
neighborhood, the number of requests would be manageable; another idea was that street
co-naming signage should not be in the historic district. Others felt that we shouldn’t co-
name streets at all. It was suggested that the Community Board should really establish a
good position on this issue.
A question was asked as to why this proposal was drawn up. Community Board
No. 1 is receiving requests from victims’ family members, and before we start approving
or not approving these requests we should have a position on the issue. We are proposing
that a moratorium be put in place until we come up with a more researched proposal.
A hand vote was taken with the following results: 37 In Favor, 1 Opposed, 0
Abstained, and 0 Recused.
B. Combined Executive and Tribeca Committees
RE: Development plans for Sites 5B & 5C – Resolution
Community Board No. 1 has considered the proposals for Sites 5B and 5C, and
has grave concerns about the bulk and height of the proposed buildings. The resolution
rejects the current development plans for those reasons. The resolution addresses the
concerns of the community, and calls upon the Economic Development Corporation to
coordinate all plans for the development of the sites with Community Board No. 1.
There were several suggested changes to the original resolution, which were
incorporated into the attached resolution, including changing the word “basement” to
“cellar”, and adding a sentence regarding the 18,000 s/f offered for the community youth
recreation facility.
A vote was taken with the following results: 37 In Favor, 0 Opposed, 1 Abstained,
and 1 Recused.C) WTC Redevelopment Committee
RE: Revised plan for the World Trade Center – Resolution
The resolution supports the master design plan for redevelopment of the World
Trade Center, and appreciates changes that have been made in response to concerns and
recommendations raised by the board. This resolution sets out additional
recommendations to the master plan.
Several comments regarding the wording of the resolution were accepted and
included in the current resolution attached. Concerns ensued regarding burying West
Street, including the location of a bus terminal, vehicular circulation, the narrowing of
West Street near the proposed drop-off site for buses, the prohibitive cost of the project,
and a concern that no decision be made on West Street without input from Community
Board No. 1. Chairperson Wils suggested that we need to have a detailed presentation on
this topic to consider all alternatives.
The resolution was voted on as amended with the following results: 36 In Favor,
2 Opposed, 1 Abstained, and 0 Recused.
RE: 7 World Trade Center – Report
The Committee was given a presentation on the progress of the building. The
lower portion of the building, which is the Con Ed substation, is well underway. They
are currently working through storage issues that will make the building much safer.
They are keeping us informed on issues, and the progress looks good.
RE: Fulton Street Transportation Hub – Report
The plan for the transportation hub shows a lot of interconnectivity, which is
something we have stressed. The Committee has shared concerns about capacity of the
hub, and we have received quick response to our questions. The Corbin building is
being worked into the design of the HUB.
D. Financial District Committee
RE: The New Staten Island (Whitehall) Ferry Terminal, percent for art projects –
Resolution
The project will near completion in about a year. The Committee agrees with the
proposed artwork program. The Committee was shown three separate art projects. One
by Ming Fay is a solid granite-and-marble seating element. The second is a pedestrian
area between the north and west areas of the terminal. The proposal includes hexagonal
pavers with fish designs. The third element, by Dennis Adams, is seating that looks out at
the harbor. The resolution supports the art projects and hopes that funding can be found.A hand vote was taken with the following results: 37 In Favor, 0 Opposed, 1
Abstained, and 0 Recused.
RE: Bowling Green Subway Station, proposed new canopy – Report
The Transit Authority is proposing a canopy over the subway entrance in order to
create a safer environment in inclement weather. They are planning a modern roof that
would compliment the proposed street furniture.
RE: Coenties Slip, revised plan for open space – Resolution
This resolution supports the new design proposed for Coenties Slip. The
Committee feels that the upgrade of the current park will benefit residents and workers in
the neighborhood. There is a request by the artist James Garvey that the furniture
currently in the park, which he created, stay after the redesign. The Committee felt that
the new furniture proposed for the park is in line with the new design.
Barbara Marks, resident and wife of artist James Garvey, stated that she is
frustrated with the community board’s lack of ability to review proposed details coming
before the board. She is requesting that Mr. Garvey’s furniture remain after the redesign
and construction. She commented that rushing the process compromises the design, and
feels that the original integrity of the park will be lost.
Mr. Garvey feels his designs cannot be produced commercially, and that the Arts
Commission approved his furniture for this park. The Downtown Alliance now owns
the furniture, and they have found another location by Trinity Place Park; however, Mr.
Garvey is not agreeable to moving his furniture.
A motion was made and seconded to table this resolution. A vote was taken with
the following results: 21 In Favor, 15 Opposed, 0 Abstained, and 0 Recused.
E. Combined Youth & Education and Seaport/Civic Center Committees
RE: New elementary/intermediate school on NYU Downtown Hospital site –
Resolution
A joint resolution concerning the inclusion of a PS/IS Elementary/Intermediate
School in the plan for the NYU Downtown parking lot site. The resolution acknowledges
the evident population explosion in our schools, and stresses that new residential projects
planned for the area will need additional schools to accommodate the number of children.
There was some discussion regarding where the parking would be located, and
whether or not the community would have input on this issue. A recommendation was
made to hold a public hearing on this issue, and to table the resolution until the
community can be involved. There was some concern as well regarding whether
requesting a school would hurt our ability to negotiate the height of the building.A motion was made to table the resolution and seconded, and a vote was taken
with the following results: 3 In Favor, 34 Opposed, 0 Abstained, and 0 Recused.
Discussion regarding the resolution continued with suggestions to add some
additional language to the last Be It Further Resolved That: CB1 looks forward to
working with Pace University on our mutual goals “without compromising the financial
interest of NYU Downtown Hospital” since both entities are vying for space in this
facility. The next-to-last BIFRT: the word “residents” was added after local elected
officials. And a friendly suggestion was made to take out references to the size of
building in the ninth Whereas.
Chairperson Wils stated that CB #1 has been on record as seeking to use this site
for a neighborhood school.

following results: 37 In Favor, 0 Opposed, 0 Abstained, and 1 Recused.

MANHATTAN COMMUNITY BOARD #1
HELD
NOVEMBER 18, 2003
MUSEUM OF JEWISH HERITAGE
36 BATTERY PLACE
The Chairperson, Madelyn Wils, called the meeting to order.
Public Session:
Elizabeth Edelstein welcomed the Board to the Museum of Jewish Heritage, and spoke
about the many exhibits currently showing in the museum. Ms. Edelstein urged everyone to
take advantage of the shops, the café, and the Memorial Garden, which are open to the public
without an admission charge. David Marwell, the director, was also thanked for making our
meeting at the museum possible.
Jen Hensley of the Alliance for Downtown New York announced that the new
Downtown Connect Buses will begin running from Battery Park City to the South Street
Seaport daily from 10 am to 8 pm every ten minutes, with specific stops posted at the bus
stops. The service is free to everyone.
Jen also announced that registration for the Downtown Little League would be held at
Manhattan Youth Resources and Recreation, 55 Warren Street.
Jimmy Gallagher, owner of the Yankee Ferry, announced his resignation from CB1
due to his selling of the boat. The new owners have promised to continue to provide the boat
for low cost or for free to community organizations that have used the boat previously.
Jimmy thanked everyone for the many years spent in the community.
Rustie Brooke, the Director of Operations for Wall Street Rising’s Downtown
Information Center, invited everyone to visit the center and take advantage of all the
information on Lower Manhattan. Their web site is Downtowninfocenter.org.
1Darryl Cochran, liaison for Congressman Nadler, wanted to mention that the
Congressman is extremely pleased about the Massachusetts court ruling on same-sex
marriages. Vermont has civil unions, as does Canada. Hopefully New York will follow suit.
Kathryn Freed announced that she would be leaving her post with Senator Marty
Conner to become a Civil Court Judge. She introduced the board to her replacement, Matt
Viggiano.
Bradford Sussman from MBPO advised that the upcoming meeting on Mitchell-Lama
housing at Hunter College will be held on Monday, Dec. 15 from 5:30 p.m.– 8:00 p.m.
Assemblymember Glick introduced her representative, Saide Dyer, to the board. Her
current report includes letters sent to the HRPT on the proposed skating rink. She liked the
idea but not the location. She has testified against the proposed West Street tunnel, which
would cost over $600 million to build, and would create a long-standing construction site with
potential security issues. Glick also sent a letter to the The New York Times to say she is very
disturbed about closing veterans’ hospitals when vets are in need of care. She believes we
have adequate resources to provide veterans proper care. She believes the ban on filming
injured and dead military troop members is a terrible precedent set by the President Bush. She
wrote to EDC about site 5C, emphasizing that the building should be more in scale with the
surrounding neighborhood, and should consider shadows it will create across parkland.
Executive Session:
The minutes of the monthly meeting held on October 21, 2003 were unanimously
approved.
Chairperson’s Report:
Chairperson Wils reported on the following items:
 Liz Thompson has resigned from the Community Board and from LMCC. She
has been a valuable member of this community, and of LMCC, and will be
missed.
 Julie Menin has been reappointed to the board. Julie heads Wall Street Rising
and had to leave board last year due to her appointment on the Redistricting
Committee.
 The Wall Street Regent is closing January 1. The building is being converted
to condominiums. We would like to encourage The Regent to keep the
ballroom intact. This is a blow to the neighborhood.
 We are concerned about the bill put forth by Carolyn Maloney and Christopher
Sheas without any discussion with the downtown community. We will do our
best to have a meeting with them to discuss further.
2 Vesey Street Bridge is opening on Sunday, November 22. The bridge will be a
well-used addition to the area.
 State DOT will begin meeting in December with the West Street Taskforce to
go over all detail work on possibilities for West Street. Chairperson Wils
wanted to encourage everyone to attend the presentation tomorrow at 2 p.m.
and 6 p.m. on West Street.
 A new Culture, Arts, and Entertainment Task Force will be chaired by Harold
Reed. The taskforce’s mandate will be to work along with LMDC and other
groups that want to bring cultural entities into the community.

A. Executive Committee:
RE: Proposed skating rink south of Pier 40--Resolution

Abstained, and 0 Recused.

RE: Lower Manhattan homeless survey--Report
There was a benchmark survey taken throughout New York City on the third week of

B. Tribeca Committee:
RE: 25 N. Moore Street, liquor license application for Brandy Library Lounge LLC---
Resolution
3This application is for a proposed brandy lounge on the ground floor of 25 N. Moore
Street. The applicant did not have all the required information, and the resolution supports the

A hand vote was called with the following results: 33 In Favor, 0 Opposed, 0
Abstained, and 5 Recused.
RE: 25 Hudson Street, liquor license application for Shinobi NY LLC--Resolution

to appear before the Tribeca Committee before taking any action on the subject application.
A hand vote was called with the following results: 33 In Favor, 0 Opposed, 0
Abstained, and 5 Recused.
RE: 345 Greenwich Street beer and wine license application for Viet Café resolution.
This application is for a restaurant located on ground floor of a residential building.

residents. Measures to be taken by the applicant to ensure residential quality-of-life are
included in the resolution.
A hand vote was called with the following results: 33 In Favor, 1 Opposed, 0
Abstained, and 4 Recused.
RE: Proposed newsstand at the northeast corner of Chambers Street and West Broadway--
Resolution.
A 4’ x 10 1/2’ newsstand is proposed for the north side of Chambers Street east of
Broadway near the Cosmopolitan Hotel. Although The Committee believes that the
newsstand is well-designed, the location is wrong since the area is very congested with
pedestrian traffic.
A hand vote was called with the following results: 36 In Favor, 0 Opposed, 0
Abstained, and 0 Recused.
RE: The NY Industrial Retention Network Proposal Report.
Board 2 and Board 3 have discussed this initiative, however, Community Board 1 has
different priorities for LMDC money and has tabled discussion until more information is
gathered.
C. Landmarks Committee:
4RE: 110 Hudson Street, application to install a metal canopy--Resolution
The applicant did not appear before the committee, and therefore the resolution urges
the LPC to hold over this application until the applicant does so.
A hand vote was called with the following results: 38 In Favor, 3 Opposed, 0
Abstained, and 0 Recused.
RE: John Street – Maiden Lane Historic District--Report.
The application has already gone to the State to receive historic status. HPC will make
a further presentation.
RE: 130 Duane Street, concerns of community with development--Resolution
Residents and local community groups appeared at several CB meetings to voice their
concern over the proposed development slated for the open lot at 130 Duane Street.
Maria Donovan, resident of the American Thread Building. The area is considered to
be historically significant. When the residents were informed of the Hersha/Chang
Development, they had concerns about the plans to build another budget hotel across from
their building. She wants to speak out against this developer, and wants to halt the Duane and
Thomas Street project in order to avoid another 320 Pearl St. disaster. She wants to obtain
agreement and monitoring of this development for reassurance that the integrity of the
building and safety can be met. She is asking elected officials to actively support this.
Jean Grillo also voiced concern about the developer and his inability to follow the
approved designs. The block association opposes this developer due to the past experiences
the community has had with him. She supports resolution.
Havry Malivowski, a resident and owner of 130 Duane Street, supports resolution.
Kathryn Freed adds that Senator Connor is supporting this resolution. Connor, Wils,
and Gerson will ask the building department to meet with community, developers, and the
architect to review the plans for the building, since no one has seen the plans.
Anthony Notaro believes the resolution should be have stronger wording. Bruce
Ehrmann feels that that the Board’s response is strong enough.
Bernie D’Orazio questioned how this building was previously reviewed and processed
by CB1. Answer: the Board has asked the Buildings Department to monitor this architect and
developer. LPC approved the building with change of use. This is as of right with Landmarks
approval. Some believe the building is out of character in the area. Roger Byrom explains the
resolution as saying, “please watch out for this project by LPC.”
5The resolution urges the LPC to monitor this developer and architect closely in
conjunction with the Department of Buildings until the project is completed.
A hand vote was called with the following results: 30 In Favor, 2 Opposed, 1
Abstained, and 0 Recused.

Abstained, and 0 Recused.
RE: Proposed marina for the area south of Pier 25--Report
There was a rumor that the HRPT was proposing a 200-300--boat marina in the small
area south of Pier 25. Connie Fishman of HRPT came to the committee meeting to discuss
the marina, but did not have a lot of information to share. The committee was not pleased
with the thought of a proposed marina in the area.
RE: Eastside Waterfront Task Force--Report
The Eastside Waterfront Plan has been expanded to include part of the waterfront in
Community Board 3 up to the East River Park. The new park would be developed from
Battery Park East up to the beginning of the East River Park.
D. Battery Park City Committee:
RE: Chamber Street pedestrian bridge elevators--Report.
The elevators are “out of service” more often than not, and there are a lot of
complaints. The BPCA came to the meeting and agrees that there is a problem. They are
having an audit done of Otis Elevators to see what they have done, and why there are so many
problems. BPCA agrees they need to make improvements.
RE: Battery Park City traffic concerns--Report.
The Committee asked that DOT conduct a study of Battery Park City- particularly in
the southern aspect, looking at new signage and crosswalks. They will review their findings
and come back to the committee for a report.

Construction started, and is scheduled to be finished by Spring 2004. The design
shows a tot-lot design, new and enlarged from that of the former park. Residents gave the
Authority input and feel confident about the park.
E. Financial Committee:
RE: 110-112 Liberty Street, liquor license application--Resolution.
The applicant did not show up, and so the committee recommends that the SLA not
approve the liquor license.
A roll call vote was taken with the following results: 34 In Favor, 0 Opposed, 0
Abstained, and 0 Recused.

There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned by the Chair.

MANHATTAN COMMUNITY BOARD #1
HELD
DECEMBER 16, 2003
SOUTH STREET SEAPORT
132 BEEKMAN STREET
The Vice Chairperson, Richard Kennedy, called the meeting to order in the
Chair’s absence.
Public Session:
Steve Schall of Schall & Russo Planning Works spoke about the World Trade
Center Health Registry. The Registry was established to study the health of people who
were living and working below Chambers Street on 9/11. The registry is funded for four
years. Other related clinical studies are being conducted by medical institutions. Mr.
Schall welcomes comments and critiques by the CB #1.
Councilmember Alan Gerson came before the Community Board and shared the
following comments:
 City Council has adopted legislation 191A, which makes New York City
the first city in the nation to regulate construction site emissions. The
legislation will require all city construction sites to use ultra-low sulfur
diesel fuel and reduce omissions. This legislation will apply to City
contracts, but will hopefully have a ripple effect to all construction sites.
 This Friday, December 19th, the Manhattan Delegation will meet to
allocate its capital discretionary dollars to the Millennium High School for
the funds needed to complete construction of the school.
 The Mitchell-Lama situation with IPN will become critical after the
holidays. The City Council is currently considering several items
concerning affordable housing preservation. We need a preservation-first
plan, and cannot afford to lose low- and middle-income housing in this
City; especially in Lower Manhattan. Alan has had preliminary meetings with the administrators at NYU
Downtown Hospital. He feels we need a world-class hospital downtown,
and therefore will be giving this issue more attention in the New Year.
 Alan supports the proposed Rec Center on Site 5B. He also raised the
idea to the Youth Committee of an International Youth Facility at ground
zero to help youth understand the significance of the tragic event, and to
regain a positive sense of the future.
Executive Session:
The minutes of the monthly meeting held on November 18, 2003 were
unanimously approved.
Chairperson’s Report:
Vice Chairperson Richard Kennedy reported that on Friday, December 19th, the
final design of the WTC Tower Plan would be presented.
Committee Reports:
NOTE: SEE RESOLUTIONS AT END OF MINUTES
Executive Committee:
RE: Proposed City Planning amendment to modify height and setback regulations for
scientific research and development facilities in C6 districts - Resolution
This proposal originated through the EDC and Columbia University. The
proposal is for a text amendment to allow for modifications of the height and setback
regulations for scientific research and development facilities in C6 districts.
Marc Ameruso recommended that the board vote against the proposal because it
would allow developers to developing biotech-type facilities more easily. Carole
DeSaram would like to table this resolution in order to investigate why City Planning is
trying to make a citywide text change for the benefit of an industry.
A motion to table was called and seconded. A roll call vote was taken with the
following results: 24 In Favor, 10 Opposed, and 1 Abstained.
RE: Liberty Bonds, need for revised legislation - Resolution
This resolution urges the City and State to reject Liberty Bond financing for any
other projects located outside of Lower Manhattan, or for any additional residential
housing project in Lower Manhattan at this time.
2Some board members feel that Liberty Bonds should be kept in Lower Manhattan,
and CB #1 should provide a consistent voice to support more development downtown.
The goal of the resolution is to keep money downtown that was intended for downtown.
A request was made to remove the reference to Goldman Sachs, but to maintain the point.
7 WTC and several residential buildings have applied for and received the Liberty Bonds.
We are allowing real estate developers to come into our community and make money, but
we should be more vocal on the need for affordable housing. There were questions
about market-rate housing and transitional housing being proposed for our neighborhood
at a time when the city needs more affordable low- and medium-income housing. The
community would like to build housing for families, not transients.
Joe Lerner said he doesn’t feel we can vote for this without reference to the need
for subsidized housing. Margaret Fung supports the issue of subsidized housing, and
feels the only two items she can support are 1) keeping money downtown; and 2)
supporting subsidized housing. Ray O’keefe said this resolution addresses the issues of
funds for commercial buildings outside the community, and the fact that we want the
funds to be kept downtown. Jen Hensley feels the resolution says that if we include use
for housing, the money will be used for small market-rate housing and commercial
building outside Lower Manhattan. This resolution is to save the WTC site and bring
back the money to Lower Manhattan.
The general consensus after much discussion was that this resolution should
include wording on our support for affordable housing through Liberty Bonds. Joe
Lerner made a friendly amendment to add a “whereas” that the Community Board
supports the use of the bonds for affordable housing. Ray O’Keefe wants to add that it is
unfortunate that the original bond legislation did not include affordable housing.
The following amendment was proposed for an additional “whereas”: “Any
additional Liberty Bond funds dedicated to residential housing must only be provided to
proposed housing which sets aside a substantial number of units to affordable and
subsidized housing.“
A vote was taken to approve the inclusion of the proposed “whereas” with the
following results: 31 In Favor, 1 Opposed, and 0 Abstained.
A motion was called and seconded, and a vote was taken on the resolution with
the following results: 39 In Favor, 1 Opposed, and 0 Abstained.
RE: Governors Island, request by Brooklyn Community Board #6 to take over
jurisdiction of the island - Resolution
This resolution was drawn as a result of Brooklyn CB #6’s resolution requesting
that Governor’s Island to be transferred to their community. CB#1 members were aware
of this resolution and there being no discussion a vote was taken with the following
results: 41 In Favor, 0 Opposed, and 0 Abstained.
3RE: Street Vendors, need for new legislation – Resolution
This resolution addresses the serious issue of street vendor congestion in the
community. The State Legislature recently allowed the legislation governing street
vendors to expire. This resolution urges the State Legislature to agree expeditiously to the
new legislation, restricting vendors or making them illegal in several areas of Lower
Manhattan.
In addition to the areas mentioned in the resolution, a request was made to include
the Canal Street area.
A vote was taken with the following results: 36 In Favor, 3 Opposed, and 2
Abstained.
WTC Redevelopment Committee:
RE: Eight final designs for the WTC memorial – Resolution
Richard Kennedy spoke of the tremendous effort that has been made by many
community board members to draft a resolution that encompasses all the issues and
concerns the community has regarding these designs.
The resolution was passed by the Executive Committee prior to the full board
meeting, as time constraints necessitated the vote and submission before the full board.
Discussion commenced on the designs, focusing on open space and accessibility,
as well as the pros and cons of each design. The resolution states the disappointment the
Board has with the eight final proposed designs, and urges the Jury to give strong
consideration to the detailed comments and recommendation included in the resolution.
A vote was taken on the above resolution with the following results: 32 In Favor,
3 Opposed, 1 Abstained, and 1 Recused.
Financial Committee:
RE: 90 West Street, planned renovation – Report
The owners of this site came to the committee to give an update on the building.
They said they have applied for Liberty Bonds. This building is national landmark,
which they intend to restore to its full beauty. They plan to complete the project by June
2005. The building will contain rental apartments.
4Combined Landmarks and Financial District Committees:
RE: Proposed John Street/Maiden Lane Historic District -- Resolution
The resolution asserts the displeasure of CB#1 at the lack of consultation by the
Historic District Council on this matter, and asserts that the needs of the community were
not included in this process.
In addition to the Community Board being kept in the dark, the LPC never
received information, and were not notified of the landmarking of this area. There is
going to be a press release tomorrow (12/17/03) to announce the protection without any
notification to the Community Board, or other organizations in the community.
Comments included the fact that there is a lot in the resolution saying we were not
involved, but doesn’t say what our position is on the issue. CB#1 should include
language stating that we are not pleased that the State bypassed us on this issue.
A motion was made to table the resolution and review the wording. The motion
was called and seconded with the following results: 16 In Favor, 19 Opposed, and 0
Abstained. The motion was defeated and the discussion continued.
A board member stated that the resolution should be more positive, and less
angry. A suggestion was made to stop the process from going forward before we have
time to examine which buildings we would like to include. It was suggested that the
Board make a clear statement that we do not support the proposed historic district as
outlined by the State agency. The Committee Chair will amend the resolution to address
CB #1’s and the community’s feelings of non-inclusion.
The resolution will be amended to include the following language; in the last Be It
Further Resolved That: “does not support the John St./Maiden Lane as currently
proposed and expects to work with SHIPO to define the final district.”
A vote was taken with the following results: 30 In Favor, 0 Opposed, and 0
Abstained.
Landmarks Committee:
RE: 430 Greenwich Street, application to relocate and reconstruct the canopy –
Resolution
The Committee recommends that the LPC approve the application to relocate and
reconstruct a canopy at the above address in accordance with the plans exhibited at the
meeting of the Landmarks Committee.
A vote was taken with the following results: 30 In Favor, 0 Opposed, and 0
Abstained.
5RE: Temporary ticket booth between Piers 17 and 17 in the South Street Seaport –
Report
The Waterways ticket booth has been removed.
Tribeca Committee:
RE: Revised design for Tribeca Park – Resolution
The Tribeca Committee unanimously approves the new design of the park. The
design includes some fencing, but still keeps most of the park open for pedestrian traffic.
A vote was taken with the following results: 30 In Favor, 0 Opposed, and 0
Abstained.
RE: Taste of Tribeca, proposed expansion to Greenwich Street - Report
The organization would like to expand the street festival to include parts of
Greenwich Street for this coming year. The Committee did not see a problem with the
expansion.
RE: 408 Greenwich Street – Resolution
This issue is being postponed until next month.
RE: 43 Murray Street, liquor license application for Below Murray, Inc. – Resolution

The Committee recommends that the CB approve this resolution.

Abstained.
RE: 157 Hudson Street, tavern wine license application for Nucifera LTD (ClubVinyl)
– Resolution.
The applicant came before the Committee and gave assurances that it would work
hard to correct problems the club has had with fights, illegal drugs, and rowdy patrons
exiting the club and disturbing residents.
The Committee strongly opposes a tavern, beer and wine license for Club Vinyl.
A vote was taken with the following results: 28 In Favor, 1 Opposed, and 1
Abstained.
6RE: 285 West Broadway, cabaret license for Canal Room - Resolution
The applicants have applied for a cabaret license and have proven to be
responsible neighbors as evidenced by the absence of complaints by the surrounding
residents. The Committee recommends approval of their application provided the license
is non-transferable and limited to the current owners, and that the permit complies with
all zoning regulations.
A vote was taken with the following results: 29 In Favor, 0 Opposed, and 1
Abstained.
Seaport/Civic Center Committee:
RE: Agency parking on sidewalks and traffic islands, and general disregard for traffic
regulations – Report.

area, and will keep working on them until some relief is seen.
Youth and Education Committee:
RE: Pending issues – Report
