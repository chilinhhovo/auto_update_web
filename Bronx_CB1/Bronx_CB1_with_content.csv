District Manager’s Report

Executive Officer 40° Police Precinct, New York City Police Department said thanks for having
me, I’m the Executive Officer for the 40° Precinct.

So, if anyone is interested in specific numbers on CompStat the information is available at
nypd.org, and you can get the concept sheet from the precinct. We've had a pretty good year
compared to a lot of other commands, but crimes are down for the 28-day period and slightly
up in robberies that’s always a big concern. Our two main concerns so far for the year and for
our 28-day period which is a month are assaults and GOA’s.

| also want to mention the positive thing which is always our main priority in the 40 Precinct
and in the Bronx in general our shootings are down. We’re addressing quality of life targeting
the gang members responsible for violence and we’ve seen some positive changes. It’s a slow
process but we’re starting to get more cooperation from the Bronx DA when we do make
arrests. The part that we are not seeing that with is felony assaults.

Mr. Freddie Perez, Jr. Acting Chairperson said thank you for your presentation. At this time,
we're opening up the forum for questions from the Boardmembers. Please can any
Boardmember raise their hand if they have a question. Now we will take any community

evening how is everybody I’ve been assigned here for about a year, and | started my career in

Basically, everything we’re seeing in PSA7 along with what Deputy Inspector Tompkins just said
you know one shooting is obviously too many, but we are down 3 less shootings this year over
last year. The latest one over at 152 was a gang thing we hope to make an arrest on that in the
future. For these 28 days we have 7 vehicles 2 were scooters and the other 5 were Kia’s, like
the Inspector said if you have a Kia there’s updates for that to fix the keys so that not easily
stolen.

Then the only other thing | have is along with him we received 10 new officers straight out of

Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said let the record reflect that the Minutes for the April 23rd Full
Board meeting passed. We’re now moving into the Public Session and the first presenters is the
40th Police Precinct of the New York City Police Department. Captain George you have the
forum.
Captain George, 40th Police Precinct, New York City Police Department said good evening
everybody I’m the Executive Officer along with Captain Jose Gomera, we the Executive Officers
of the 40 Precinct. Tonight, I brough with me the Neighborhood Coordination Sergeant,
Sergeant Polanco.
So, will get right into it in regard to crime we’re down in murders, we are up in robberies with
being up in robberies we do have a lot of arrests we’re pretty good in catching the bad guy once
they do what they do. We’re up in assaults, up in burglaries, down in grand larcenies but up in
thefts of autos. What we’re seeing with the thefts of autos they’ll dip into a store for five to ten
minutes and may leave the car running and somebody jumps in, and they take the vehicle for a
ride so, that’s the common thread in the theft of motor vehicles. Another common thread that
we’ve been seeing this just didn’t start now it’s been a normal phenomenon for probably the
past year the fob, just keep in mind that we’re trying to get out to the public that even if you
have the fob to your vehicle in the range of about 15 ft. the car will still know that it’s there and
start so, if you have it running and have the fob out it’s in radius they can still joy ride for up to
two to three blocks until the vehicle shuts off. So, that’s what we’re finding people taking the
vehicle for joy rides and then just dump in places when it stops. So, we’re trying to get that out
to the public keep your hands on your keys if you’re going into a store lock the vehicle off
completely and then conduct your business.
With regards to schools we’re focusing on crime in the adjoining parks, we know that the
schools are about to finish that’s when you have these two week breaks regents that kids aren’t
taking they like to hang around and we usher them from places like McDonald’s and you know
places where they congregate because of the bad tensions that are stirring during September
and in other months they come to a head in the warmer months. So, we do have a SchoolFULL BOARD
MINUTES
April 23, 2023
Pg. 3
Safety Officer, School Safety Sergeants who patrol the schools, they go to the schools in the
beginning of the day, they also go to the schools at dismissal to make sure that these schools
are safe. Granted there are a lot of schools in the 40 Precinct so we do have to prioritize
depending on how much violence is at a particular school so you may have a school that’s not
that violent so you may not see Officers, but you may say hay my daughter goes to school, and
we see an Officer there and this is the reason for that. We’re still also focusing on traffic in and
around the schools to make sure that our kids are safe, I say our kids because when I put on this
uniform those are my kids. So, this is how we want to treat them, we want to make sure that
when they’re crossing the street that you know they’re safe.
Just to segue into traffic we have a lot of parked commercial trucks on residential blocks, and
we’ve been trying to move that out. When it comes to big heavy duty box trucks there’s only
one heavy duty tow for the whole NYC and its hard to move those vehicles, but we do
summons the vehicles with $500 dollar fines, and we really try to make sure that they’re life is
impacted a little bit.
With regards to forged license plates, you know they’re around everywhere, we’re seeing
crimes being committed and they have these temporary paper tags on them. You know we
can’t trace these cars, so we really do our best to try and find these cars, if we see somebody
that’s driving one we arrest them, nine times out of ten those plates won’t belong to anything,
and it just doesn’t match so we’re getting them off the street.
ATV’s motorcycle’s you know this is a big problem in the summer months the warmer months
because everyone’s riding them, in New York it’s a mode of transportation so everyone’s doing
it from the delivery guy to the kid to just have a good time to the grown up who just had an ATV
and he or she just wants to drive around in them. I say he or she because male and females
they do it, we have been issuing summons and seized a whole bunch of them for the last 28-day
period we seized 21 and we issued 92 summonses. At the beginning of the year, we seized 53
and issued 220 summonses. Keep in mind that when we issue the summonses when we seize
the vehicles for everyone we take four more pop up. So, you may think that we’re not out here
doing our job, but we are doing our job it’s just that it’s so hard to put a dent in them when you
arrest one or two people and six people bring the same one’s into our neighborhoods. With
regards with them bringing them into the neighborhoods we really try to deter them we really
try stop whoever is riding the bike because we’ve had instances where older gentlemen older
women, and kids have been hurt, this is what we don’t want. We want our streets safe, and
these are modes to get away from the Police because it’s easier to cut up a block and difficult
for a police vehicle to follow on the sidewalk, so this is why this is a vehicle of choice for some
criminals.FULL BOARD
MINUTES
April 23, 2023
Pg. 4
When it comes to police presence you’re going to find that there’s more of an uptake of police
presence in the warmer months because we take police officers from all around and we flood
them in places that have the potential for high violence and prone to violence. This is some of
the reasons why we’re down in shootings, and down in robberies because you see the police
officer on the street and they’re there on foot, and one in the car so you know we’re out there
and we mean business. So, this is the reason why the streets are a little bit safer and knock-on
wood that it stays just that safe.
When it comes to Third Avenue the HUB we’re trying to get out the message please keep track
of your stuff. If you just bought something keep it on you and your purse keep it on you
because there’s so many stores on the HUB and its easy pickings for somebody to run past you
grab from you something that you’ve just bought so, please be aware of your surroundings.
That’s the information we’re trying to give out to everybody we’re even going into schools
trying to give this information to the kids because we see the kids like to buy a lot of nice stuff a
lot of expensive stuff more expensive than what we wear. So, we have to make sure that the
kids know, and adults know, and we also speak to the store owners to try and improve their
safety in their stores there should be camera’s, door locks etc., we just everyone safe all around
for those shopping and those working in the stores. That’s it.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said that the floor is now open for any Boardmembers that have
questions and then the at large community.
Questions and Answers
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said thank you for coming and making your presentation. Let’s
move the agenda. The next presentation if from the PSA7 Housing Bureau, you have the forum
Deputy Inspector Yerlin Moya, PSA7 Housing Bureau, New York City Police Department said
hello everybody, I’m the Commander of PSA7 and we cover public housing in the south Bronx
and therefore within the 40th Precinct.
So, for us in the 40th Precinct crime is slightly up 47 crimes versus 40 obviously a small fraction
of the overall crime in the precinct. Our issues right now very simply is robberies, we’re up in
robberies 117 percent mainly due to food delivery service workers being robbed when they goFULL BOARD
MINUTES
April 23, 2023
Pg. 5
to make the food deliveries. Unfortunately, if you order some food and the person doesn’t
want to come upstairs that’s probably the reason why and I know that you guys can understand
that. We have made an arrest and the main place that this was happening is the Millbrook
Houses we had about five incidents there. We caught one live where one of the perpetrators
went into one of the apartments and we were able to make and arrest on that. It has since
moved on we’ve had two incidents in Patterson Houses and it’s happened in Betances, it’s
pretty much a spread-out condition periodically in housing so, hopefully we can keep a lid on it
moving forward.
Another issue we’ve had is grand larceny auto of vehicles including mopeds and scooters right
now we have five for the 28-day period but one of these crimes is too many, right we’d love to
have it zero, statistically we have five versus zero compared to the same period last year. The
main issue is the stealing of cars, there was a tic tock video showing people how to steal these
cars and it’s become a big issue so if you have any newer cars since 2018 there’s apps
connected to the vehicle that you can track the vehicle so if you have those please look into
that and not to leave your vehicle unattended but it’s a small fraction of the overall crime.
When it comes to housing our main concern is violence with the crews and the gangs, we do
have two shootings for the year compared to eight last year it has decreased obviously. The
first one was March 27th it was a domestic situation and it happened on the side of Westchester
a young man basically followed his ex-girlfriend he confronted her, and he ended up shot but
he’s okay. I’d like to mention that the 40thPrecinct has one of the best Detective Squads in the
NYPD in my opinion and they’re very good at finding out who did it and bringing them to
justice, so we have who it is. The second shooting was April 13th at 745 East 152nd Street, it was
two young men that had a dispute, and one ends up shooting the other and we have an idea
who it is as well. In success with the shooters recently we did have a shots fired incident that’s
when somebody attempts to shoot somebody doesn’t make contact, and that did happen on
Tuesday, the condition there is presumably people from Mott Haven going into an area of
another crew and this is just retaliation so we’re investigating that as well. For the year the
main development of our concern is Mitchell Houses however, its mainly felony assaults, for
the period I do have nineteen felony assaults fifteen of them are domestic related and with ten
of them have an arrest already effected. With the domestic assaults we pretty much know who
it did so therefore it’s only a matter of time before we arrest them. Obviously the focus is to
protect the family and they can be placed in programs. The Domestic Violence Unit does home
visits on all these crimes, and they also keep of list of individuals that are at high risk. If one
family keeps having incidents of assault they need special attention, so we make sure that we
visit them multiple times a month and we refer them to programs outside of the NYPD and to
other services that the city has.FULL BOARD
MINUTES
April 23, 2023
Pg. 6
Another concern that we do have is burglaries which is trespassing into a location that they’re
either stealing or another type of crime we do have eight compared to three and there are
maintenance rooms being broken into whether it’s a senior center or people breaking in and
stealing equipment, unfortunately it’s a condition that we do see periodically.
As far as arrests, we are up in arrests 150 arrests versus 87 for this period, with summonses we
are slightly down 123 versus 197 last year at this time for this period we’ve got some quality
assurance when it comes to summonses it has to be the right people you have to use discretion
we don’t want the old lady getting a summons or one individual get three summonses at the
same time so if it doesn’t make sense we try to use discretion with the community. That’s
pretty much all I have does anyone have any questions.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson asked does any Boardmember have any questions.
Questions and Answers
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said thank you for coming. The next presentation is the CONBUD
& Summit Canna and they’ve been issued a temporary license to Operate Retail Cannabis
Dispensary in reference to OCM License Number: Caurd-2022000221 and they want to open
the dispensary at 2412 Third Avenue, Bronx, NY 10454 the site of the old Bruckner Bar & Grill.
You have the forum.
Mr. Alfredo Angueira, CONBUD said good evening Chairperson Parks, District Manager Jordan
it’s an honor to be here this evening as well as the esteemed members of the Board. We are
here about a dispensary coming to 2412 Third Avenue. We’re here because the MRTA required
we notify the Community Board with 30-day notice prior to us opening. So, for the sake of
brevity I’ve been asked to cut the presentation short but there is a more in depth look into the
operation that was provided to the Board so you can look through that at your leisure.
So, we’re going to fast forward a little bit and go directly to the leadership model so you can
understand who is going to be responsible for the business and what their roles are going to be,
Michael Montas the CEO born and raised in the Bronx, currently residing in Westchester, NY;
Ronald Martinez, COO that’s the Chief Operating Officer responsible for all operational
ongoings within the business; George Jimenez, CCO the Chief Compliance Officer and for thoseFULL BOARD
MINUTES
April 23, 2023
Pg. 7
of you who may not be familiar with the term he is the individual who is responsible for
ensuring that the business stays within New York City guidelines; and laws and in relation to the
group that is going to be consulting there is Coss Marte who is the CEO of CONBUD; Junior
Martinez who is the COO and myself Alfredo Angueira who is the CCO as we described earlier
which is the Chief Compliance Officer.
Will be skipping ahead to the company comprehensive snapshot. What you see before you is a
picture of 2412 Third Avenue that is the front of the building. We were founded in 2022 that is
again the address, the actual property manager is One Bruckner LLC, the services that will be
provided there will be pickup, delivery, online order and in-person shopping. We will
approximately be hiring 50 plus individuals, so there will be individuals hired up and down the
ladder and what I mean is individual who will be working on the floor, individuals who will be
managing, and those who will be packing so there will be an integration of jobs. The products
that will be provided will be the actual consumable flower, pre-rolls, oils and extracts, edibles,
tropical creams, accessories, branded apparel and merchandise. If anyone here wishes to learn
more about the in-depth story feel free to visit the website.
Project overview so, the location is approximately 2,650 square feet, the parking will be on
street there are other facilities within the area some projects that were developed and there is
parking in those buildings but we will not have reserved spaces there so it will be on street
parking but there are facilities off street. We’re in the process of negotiating with NorthStar
Security, Smith Architects is the individual who will be doing the buildout and Temeka Group
we are currently in discussions with to do construction, we estimate it will take approximately
90 to 120 days once we receive permits to be up and operational, the total cost of the project
we estimate to be about $900,000 thousand. We had some questions in reference to the
financing structure is $100,000 thousand for the buildout and operational costs and totally
privately financed and that is without any city, state or governmental funds. We’re going to
fast forward a few slides to discuss the jobs and job creations.
As I indicated earlier 50 percent of the jobs that we will be bringing will be at a prevailing wage
or higher, what does that mean, it means that the jobs we are creating there will be above the
minimum wage we estimate that our lowest level employee will be making approximately $20
dollars an hour. Our current business model that we currently operate in the Bronx we own 7
businesses here and within the number of whom we employ we ran our numbers, and we
provided a payroll of over $1.1 million dollars to individuals who are operating in the Bronx. On
that model we extricated out and determined the monies that we will be providing and how
the tax base will be generated to the individuals working at the dispensary we estimate that it
will be approximately $2.7 million in salary for those individuals working at the dispensary
again, a guesstimate will be approximately 50 individuals at different levels.FULL BOARD
MINUTES
April 23, 2023
Pg. 8
Our current model is on or about a 20 percent of these individuals that we currently employ
and the 50 individuals that we are projecting to employ will most likely be 80 percent Bronx
residents, that is imperative within this model once we do the math, and we understand every
dollar that an individual earns 70 cents of your dollar stays within the community. So, we are
talking about adding over $2.7 million to that economic base and that recycles within this
community.
The current company that we’re working with is an insured and bonded security company, it’s
owned by a former NYPD Officer we will be providing guards at the entrance and exit of the
establishment. High end security systems that consist of interior and exterior digital cameras,
two-step biometric authorization, panic button and auxiliary power in case of emergency we
also have perimeter lighting and 24-hour live monitoring. All patrons will be checked for
government issued identification as per New York State law no persons under the age of 21 will
be permitted onto the premises. Security will be monitoring perimeters to avoid loitering
which will not be permitted as well as line surveillance to ensure compliance on a smoke free
line at all times. I know that there have also been some concerns and questions about how
money will be moving around we’ve partnered with a local community bank which is Ponce
Bank which is here in the Bronx was founded by individuals of color because they couldn’t get
any banking needs. We bank with them, and we’ve created a partnership and they will be
providing a daily armored truck for any kind of cash or any needs we may have with our
banking and our security with that level.
For crowd control again they’ve been some concerns and we wanted to make sure that we
addressed it in relation to the storefront and how things would operate we’re going to install
LED bright lights all around the exterior and perimeter of the establishment, there will be
organized and structured flow line and stanchions and for those of you that don’t know what
stanchions are the ropes that kind of stand between that kind of magnetic thing, live
monitoring to ensure no smoking compliance, no loitering, no disorderly conduct permitted,
exit and entry supervision, surveillance system with facial recognition to identify banned
individuals so that they can no longer return, target and transaction time to minimize in lines
and on line pre-orders so individuals can order on their phone and computer and pickup so as
to reduce the amount of time the individual can be outside. There are some more
comprehensive items that are within the package and again for the sake of brevity we’re going
to cut it short and open for questions I’m sure that there are quite a few.

It's residential buildings one is 9-stories and the other one is 10-stories it will comprise of 163
residential units of mixed affordable housing with 30 percent of the units set aside for seniors it
will be a total of 48 units out of 163. Also, they’ve included 31 parking spaces in the project,
but the parking spaces are not free. They will have a live-in superintendent, two maintenance
men one on the senior building and one on the residential building. They anticipate beginning
construction in July of this year and ending in December of 2025. The project cost is
approximately $100 million dollars. The environmental study was made without any
contaminable problems. They will have a virtual doorman, gym, laundry room and Wi-Fi
throughout the building. Out of the 163 units 40 percent are for extremely and very low-
income residents, 60 percent for low or moderate and 15 percent of the units have to be set
aside for formerly homeless. A motion to approve a letter of support was made by a

regarding her report please send them in and will get them addressed. Moving the agenda
forward is the Elected Officials Reports. Is there anyone here from the Mayor’s Office, no. Is
there anyone here from the Bronx Borough President’s Office.
The representative from the Office of the Bronx Borough President, Honorable Vanessa L.
Gibson said good evening. On behalf of Borough President Vanessa Gibson, I’d like to report
that we have vetted 547 applicants to the Community Board for reappointment and
appointment. Those that we have already recommended have gone to the second level
recommendations to the Borough President and the Borough President will be making final
decisions. There has been a robust plea from the Borough President through social media and
we’ve been trying to get more people involved. We’ve had a very robust Bronx Week and we
honored people from the community Sunny Alston from the View, Dr. Luis Torres from PS55
and Sisters with Voices from Forest Houses. Right here in Community Board 1 we had a very
robust Health Day at St. Mary’s Park people were seen, people were treated for screenings.
We’ve given out 500 or more prom dresses and tuxes to needy students that was on Friday.
We’ve been working very hard with the Mayor’s Office regarding the E-Bike crisis.FULL BOARD

Also, the foremost thing on her mind has been the high infant mortality rate, it’s the highest in
the state she’s been with the commission working on that. She activated her HIV Committee
will have our annual meeting and will do the first ever march right here at Lincoln Hospital. The
Gender Based Violence Taskforce has been meeting, so they’ve been working on those ends.
Our telephone number is 347-213-0375 and we’re wishing everybody a belated happy Mother’s
Day and a pre happy Father’s Day. Thank you very much.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson asked is there anyone here from Congressman Richie Torres’s
Office.
The representative from the Office of the Congressman, Honorable Richie Torres said hello,
I’m here representing Congressman Richie Torres. I’ve got a few announcements for you guys
one of them is I believe Kenny spoke a little bit about the E-Bikes. At the ground level the
Congressman, he introduced a bill related to the lithium battery mobility devices specially to
create a consumer safety standard for these devices especially with the situations of the fires
happening and it has increased in the past years.
The second announcement is related although this is a little bit north to CB1, last year DOT
received $2 million dollars from the city to work on a study to reimagine the Cross Bronx. This
is something that the Congressmember along with Senator Schumer like was fighting for it with
many environmental justice groups from the Bronx. Now there’s some workshops and I’ve left
some flyers in the back to get community input when we talk about reimagining the Cross
Bronx like what should be part of that should we cap the Cross Bronx, should we put more
housing, if we cap should we put more parks with some of the different ideas that you have as
well, should we have more bike lanes, there’s multiple options we could think about for the
Cross Bronx. That’s what’s happening right now and after that hopefully there will be some
workshops within the next month or so and then at the end of next year the results of the study
will come.
The other announcement that I have is that we have made many inquiries about people that
were born in Puerto Rico, and it was difficult for them to get like documents like birth
certificates or any other kind of documents from the government of Puerto Rico. So, we got
together with the government of Puerto Rico and with Governor Hochul we were able like to
make a partnership and now Puerto Rico’s is going have an office here in the Bronx providing
these services. So, if you need more information about these services or hear of anyone that
requires documents you can call to our office, and we will provide you with theFULL BOARD

information. They’re setting up the office right now and in the process of hiring people but that
will come like soon.
Our office was previously located at the Banknote we had to move because of redistricting so
our office is now 540 East Fordham Road, and we provide any services related to federal
agencies like IRS, Social Security and so on. Have a great night.
Arline Parks, Chairperson asked is there anyone here from Senator Serrano’s Office, no. Is
there anyone here from Senator Sepulveda’s Office, no. Is there anyone here from Assembly
woman Chantel Jackson.
The representative from the Office of the Assemblywoman, Honorable Chantel Jackson said
how’s everybody doing. My job is basically to let you guys know what resources we are
offering.
I don’t know if you guys know that the budget was recently passed so $360 million dollars was
allocated specifically for ERAP. If you know or are someone who needs assistance in arrears
dating back to the Pandemic and need assistance paying those rent arrears please reach out to
the office.
Other than that, we have two events coming up specifically for the youth. We were able to
partner with the NYC Public Library and that event will come out at Concourse Village school on
this coming Tuesday which is May 30th from 11 to 3. So, we’re giving out library cards that give
the children the opportunity to get books and they have them for three weeks before they have
to take them back to any public library in the five boroughs. We also have an expunged event
coming up on June the 3rd so anybody that has a criminal record ranging from simple things to
more severe things like a felony they’ll let you know what your options are whether it can be
sealed or expunged.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson asked is there anyone here from Assemblywoman Amanda
Septimo’s Office, no. Is there anyone here from the City Comptroller’s Office Brad Lander, no.
Is there here from the Public Advocate’s Office Jumaane D. Williams, no. Is there anyone here
from Councilman Salamanca’s Office, no. Is there anyone here from the Deputy Speaker’s

Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said we’re now going to item number 6 on the agenda which is
the Public Session. Please keep in mind that after each presentation the Boardmembers will be
afforded the opportunity to ask questions followed by the members of the public who are
present on the Webex call. The first presentation for tonight’s meeting is Mr. Paul Philps, he is
the Bronx Borough Director for New York City Department of City Planning. Mr. Philps you have
the forum.
Mr. Paul Philps, Bronx Borough Director for New York City Department of City Planning said
thank you Ms. Parks and I want to thank for DM Jordan for giving me some time.
So, as Ms. Parks mentioned I am the new Borough Director for the Department of City Planning
Bronx Office. Some of you may remember me I see some familiar faces back when I was a little
bit younger, and my beard was not peppered with gray. I was the liaison for Community Board
1 for the Bronx Office of City Planning from 2010 to 2016. Most recently I was the District
Manager for Community Board 4 from 2016 to January of this year.
I’ve been on the job a little over 3 months and I’ve been making rounds to all the Bronx CB’s.
First let me begin by saying that I know firsthand how hard all of you work as volunteers to
contribute to the long-term growth and stability of your neighborhoods. I also have
tremendous respect and admiration for the work that you do. Having been a DM for nearly 7
years I’ve known of all the responsibilities that you’ve all been tasked with on a daily basis, land
use being one of the most critical as it has long lasting impacts on your neighborhoods. When I
was liaison I made a point to attend your meetings and learn about the district and set
challenges, goals and aspirations. There is no better repository or encyclopedia of a
neighborhood then the people that live there. My goal or hope is that our agency can be a
resource for all 12 Boards for the Bronx and the neighborhoods that they serve. I want to
assure you that the Bronx Office is committed to providing you with the tools and knowledge
that you require to make informed decisions about land use. We want to be a resource in
helping you all understand land use and the city’s land use review process. I believe in
transparency and communication, and I promise you that we will not always agree or have
consensus, but I can promise you that we will have purpose and listen actively. I look forward
to working with you all in this new role to serve in the City of New York and the borough of the
Bronx.
In addition, I wanted to take the opportunity this evening to introduce you to one of my new
staff members that I’m very excited about and she will be the liaison for the Board and her
name is Brenna Hemmings. Brenna is a Bronx native who received her Master’s in Urban
Planning from Hunter in 2020 and her BA in Sociology from CUNY. Before joining CPC sheFULL BOARD
April 27, 2023
Pg. 3
worked as a paralegal in a New York City Law Firm, she was at MIT Innovators as a Research
Associate, and she also interned at New York City’s DDC. Brenna is a tremendous addition to
the Bronx team and will be an asset to Community Board 1. With that I thank you all and I’m
happy to answer any questions that people have.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson asked so, does any Board member present have any questions of
Mr. Philps at this time?
Questions and Answers
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said thank you for coming tonight. The next presenter is Ms.
Julie Camagong she is the Political & Community Organizer from the New York State Nurses
Association. Thank you for coming tonight, you have the forum.
Ms. Julie Camagong, New York State Nurses Association said hi, good evening Chair Parks and
thank you so much for the opportunity for our nurses at New York State Nurses Association in
particular our nurses at Lincoln Hospital to speak with you tonight. I will be giving the floor to
one of our nurses and member of the Executive Committee of the New York State Nurses
Association at Lincoln Hospital and her name is Ms. Mosue King, she will be speaking about the
several issues of their fight for a fair contract that is ongoing right now.
Ms. Mosue King, New York State Nurses Association at Lincoln Hospital said good evening
everyone I work at Lincoln Hospital in the Emergency Department. Right now, since March 2nd
almost 90 thousand New York City Health & Hospital nurses have no contract, the contract
expired. This is the first time that we’re in a bargaining for a new contract, nurses and
professionals working in public health systems need a fair contract to deliver the care that New
York City residents need. What we found out is that we train nurses Health & Hospitals is
being used as a training ground and we can’t afford to do that we train people and then they
leave because of the low pay rate. If you consider young nurses coming on they have loans to
pay and things to take care of and they’re not going to stay with Health & Hospitals and they’re
not going to stay with a public hospital because they’re colleagues are making more money
than them and the cost of living in New York City we all now is very high. What happens is
when all these nurses are trained, and they leave it brings a burden on the nurses that are left.
So, were exposed to all kinds of danger from families because they’re frustrated. It’s costingFULL BOARD
April 27, 2023
Pg. 4
the city more money to pay agency nurses instead of staff nurses in the system. Right now, in
Jacobi alone 35 percent of the nurses there are agency nurses, we are grateful for them coming
to give us help when we needed help but at the same time if you pay nurses right they will stay
at the bedside. Most of these nurses coming back are nurses that we’ve trained but they leave
because they don’t feel that they are getting paid for what they are worth. The staffing at our
public hospitals is driving an enormous disparity between private and public nurses which is
growing even worse now. The City and State must prioritize funding and invest in us to achieve
equity and quality care for all New Yorkers. When we have all the migrants coming in where
they go, to the public hospitals in Lincoln every day we see thousands and thousands of people,
and we don’t have the nursing staff to care for these people and they need nurses at the
bedside. Nurses are leaving because they’re burnt out, you can’t have a new nurse that’s just
finished orientation training a new nurse, it’s not safe and that’s been happening because
nurses are leaving the beside. So, in order to serve all New Yorkers in the way they deserve,
pay parity has to be on the front page. You guys can help us in this fight because it’s not fair to
us after all we did during the Pandemic risked our lives, risked our families and now we still
don’t have a contract and this contract is dragging too long. The further it drags away the more
we lose nurses at the bedside so, we are kindly asking the Board to help us in this fight so we
can get safe staffing and parity with private sectors. Thank you and there’s a website
welovenynurses.org.
Mr. Arline Parks, Chairperson said thank you for your presentation. At this time, we’re opening
up the forum for questions from the Boardmembers. Please can any Boardmember raise their
hand if they have a question, does any community member have a question?
Questions and Answers
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said thank you so much for having the courage and informing us
tonight and I encourage everyone on Community Board 1 and the residents in the community
to go to that website that has been posted and support the nurses in their fight. That
concludes the Public Session for tonight’s meeting. We will move the agenda to item number 7
which is the Chairperson’s Report, and I will be very brief because we have a full report from
the District Manager for tonight’s meeting. So, there are two important announcements I will
make tonight one is regarding cannabis as many of you know cannabis is a new industry that is
being promoted throughout the state by the State and the City of New York. It is now legal, and
they are starting to issue licenses, we have now gotten an official request for a new cannabis
location to open up in Port Morris at the site of the Bruckner Bar & Grill. We have reached out
to the licensee to come before the Board next month basically present their project to a jointFULL BOARD
April 27, 2023
Pg. 5
session of the Economic Development-Land Use & Housing and also at the Health-Human
Services & Seniors Committee. In that same regard the District Manager and I are working on a
survey that will be out to each of you in the next couple of days regarding cannabis and the
impact that it has been announced that the industry is legal of cannabis on the district. In going
forward, we will be outreaching the Board on issues that impact us so that so that we
understand what the needs are of the district. So, we are in the process of doing that and we
sent out information around the cannabis legislation, please take the time to read it and
understand it and I’m encouraging everyone to respond to that survey in the next couple of
days when it comes out. Then number two is for those individuals who live in the Port Morris
corridor and that are on the Board make sure that you come out to the meeting so that you are
heard in reference to that particular matter.
The next announcement that I have to make is regarding an issue that is affecting Community
Board 1 and has been affecting us for decades, it has to do with the siting of shelters,
supportive housing in the district. Both Community Boards 5 and 6 are taking the initiative to
host a joint meeting on Monday to discuss city shelter siting policy. They sent out a flyer for
everyone to come and join them and I plan of attending as well. They have been doing their
research to figure out throughout the Bronx which districts have no shelters or supportive
housing, they’ve been able to determine that 8 districts have no shelters. The meeting will take
place May 1st at 6:00 PM it will be at 137 School Campus 2190 Follen Street; we will send the
information out to you. Again, we should be part of this discussion because nowhere in the
Bronx the siting of these facilities impacted any segment of the Bronx as it has ours and for
decades we should participate and be present for this discussion as well.
Then the last item that I want to discuss is simply a recap of where we are in terms of plans or
restructuring the Board. So, I’m proud that we are live streaming one of our main goals and a
goal that various members of the Board have basically asked that we get done for some time
so, we are now tonight officially compliant.
We produced an operating budget to you and by the next maybe a week or so we will be
sending out a list of items on the surplus that we will have and on what we would like to spend
that surplus on so that we don’t lose the money June 1st, and then we will need a vote from the
Board to spend the surplus. We’ve actually started the process from the date Mr. Jordan
became the District Manager and doing a good great job of going into the office and cleaning it
up and getting it all professionalized and making determinations of what the Board needs in
terms of digitizing the records of the office and you know just making sure that we’re operating
efficiently as we need to be.FULL BOARD
April 27, 2023
Pg. 6
Then the next item we have been working on is basically dealing with the Board to make sure
we have Boardmember attendance so that we can take care of the business and our fiduciary
obligations on behalf of the district to conduct business of the community. So, that pretty
much concludes my report and I want to thank each and every one of you for hanging in there
as we move forward on the next phase of you know organizing and getting CB1 to be one of the
best Board’s in the borough of the Bronx, thank you for participating. That being said I will turn
the agenda over to the District Manager Mr. Jordan, you have the forum sir.
Mr. Anthony R. Jordan, District Manager said thank you Ms. Chair, Mr. Vice Chair, ladies and
gentlemen for the opportunity, the best part of my job is to advise you as to what we’ve been
working on here as a team in the office and what has been happening in the district that relates
to the Community Board office.
First of all, one of the things I want to say is I want to thank the members on the Board and to
ensure that we are in compliance and up with the technology by live streaming Community
Board meetings on YouTube. This is just one step in moving forward towards making sure that
we have a transparent respectable Board. Live streaming on this level on YouTube we are
assuring that the public and the community-at-large are aware of the ins and outs of all of us
fulfilling our fiduciary responsibilities. But it doesn’t stop here the Chairperson and I have been
having very serious conversations to say what’s next making sure that all of us are transparent
and ensuring that the work of the Board is known. So, please look forward to the next steps as
the Chair and I work here at the Board to ensure that we are using other platforms or that we
can live stream our conversations about the work of the Community Board. You all know the
borough is growing by leaps and bounds and it is important that the work is respected and that
we all fulfill ourselves as missionaries for these communities that we serve.
You all have received some emails from me that I talk about various things so, one of the things
as Community Boardmembers is the training that is being offered by our partners in
government and we appreciate the office of the Bronx Borough President for bringing out those
trainings. I invite to please take advantage of those trainings that helps you become a stronger
individual as you serve on these committees it’s better for all of us to have a comprehensive
understanding when we enter into conversations with people who present to us about
everything being developed from affordable housing, the siting of shelters or understanding
how we should operate the Board or its committees. I know that we all have busy lives, but the
work of the Board is going to definitely pickup, and trainings are essentially important to you
so, take advantage of them.FULL BOARD

If you’re looking to be reappointed to the Community Board remember you must go online first
and fill out your electronic application and you must setup an interview with the Bronx Borough
President’s Office and that interview takes 15 minutes of your time. That allows for the
Borough President’s Office to make the process going forward to ensure that people who are
interested new or reappointed members have an opportunity to have those conversations and
so make sure that you make those appointments.
Another great thing that I want to report the Community Board is hiring after 25 years of
service we’re sadly losing Ana Rojas our Coordinator who has decided to retire. With Ana’s
departure from the Community Board the Executive Committee worked on developing the Job
Description which you all should have received for a Community Associate. The Community
Associate has salary range between from $45 to $50 thousand a year including city benefits.
The resumes have to go through the city’s E-Hire which is the nyc.gov/jobs you all should have
received the New York City E-Hire number that is directly connected to this position. If you
know of a candidate or yourself looking for a career change it has to go through the E-Hire
process on-line, please do not submit resumes directly to the Community Board as the
Community Board cannot receive resumes must follow the E-Hire system. You should have also
received the link if you have not reach out to me tomorrow and I’ll make sure to get a copy of
the directions to you. We’re looking to complete this process as quickly as possible so that we
can have a seamless transition from Ana moving out and a new person being able to hit the
ground running, I’m excited about that process going forward.
As the Chairperson mentioned in her report it is my job to ensure that we can take this
institution and to be able to move it as quickly as possible into the 20th century with operating
automated technology. The Chairperson has charged me to ensure that to try to use
technology so we’re working to automate our constituent complaints and have been talking to
many of you on the phone about many different issues such as double parking in your
community and all the issues that you’ve observed. I along with the Chairperson have been
around the district doing some analysis of issues that have been happening in the district. I
myself look for you to invite me if you have seen something or have pictures, many of you have
issues that you want me to look at from current construction to potholes in the street to
sanitation not being picked up, street not being swept, traffic conditions and so on. I’ve been
working very closely with our Police Enforcement officials to make sure that public safety is
focused on, and I was able to get our Commanding Officer from the 40th Precinct and the
Commanding Executive Officer from PSA7 to come to our Community Board meetings once a
month to give an update about what’s happening and hear your concerns about what’s going
on. This doesn’t stop here because the District Manager’s job is also to make sure that you
along with the Chair know what is going on in your district. So, we’re going to make that we’re
planning in the very near future on getting a district tour, the Chairperson is working with me to
think about all creative ways to make sure that people can be excited about this tour for a busFULL BOARD
April 27, 2023
Pg. 8
to take us around the district and us sitting down and having conversations having a facilitator
be able to talk about those communities historically. All challenges as members of the Board is
my work and the Chairs to make sure the work is being done and that we’re having full
conversations, I’m excited about this work going forward.
Also understand about the environmental injustices that has been happening in this community
for far too long. The South Bronx has been a dumping ground for such injustices as the Peaker
Plant that has been placed in this district and operating and providing hardship to this
community for so many years. At the request of the Chair, we are going to continue to respond
to environmental injustices that are happening in this district to issues like the traffic
congestion rising asthma and other respiratory illnesses. The time is now so we are developing
a 30-page response so we will be voting in early May on the Community Board’s response for
the closing down of that Peaker Plant. Madam Chair this is the District Manager’s report.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson asked does a Boardmember have any questions at this time. We
need all the Community Boardmembers who are the Ambassadors for the community to have
all hands-on deck because there’s a lot going on in the community and if we don’t speak up and
get engaged then we might not like the results for what other people are planning for the
community where we live at so, please stay engaged. That being said Mr. District Manager is
the 40th Precinct here, yes then you have the forum.
Deputy Inspector Joseph Tompkins, Commanding Officer 40th Police Precinct, New York City
Police Department said thanks for having me, I’m the Commanding Officer for the 40th Precinct
and I’ve been here a year already and my first-time meeting with the Board, I appreciate the
invite.
So, if anyone is interested in specific numbers on compstat the information is available at
nypd.org, and you can get the concept sheet from the precinct. We’ve had a pretty good year
compared to a lot of other commands, but crimes are down for the 28-day period and slightly
up in robberies that’s always a big concern. Our two main concerns so far for the year and for
our 28-day period which is a month is assaults and GOA’s.
I also want to mention the positive thing which is always our main priority in the 40 Precinct
and in the Bronx in general our shootings are down for the year 5 versus 11 so we actually have
half the number of shootings there’s 6 less shootings compared to last year at this time. We’re
addressing quality of life targeting the gang members responsible for violence and we’ve seen
some positive changes it’s a slow process but we’re starting to get more cooperation from the
Bronx DA when we do make arrests. The part that we are not seeing that with is felony assaultsFULL BOARD
April 27, 2023
Pg. 9
and it’s up by 16 percent and GOA’s we’re not seeing the crazy increases everyone else is. The
Bronx overall is up 50 percent in grand larceny autos about 2 percent but recently we had a
decrease. So, felony assaults first all are strictly domestic violence. The reason I want to bring
it up in an open forum like this is because domestic violence is a very difficult crime but there
are ways of intervention obviously when someone is victimized we are able to offer them
services, we able to get them different types of resources that can help them get out of a bad
situation and if it’s something serious enough the offender will go to jail. That’s always going to
be reactionary because now the person has been assaulted at the point where the Police are
involved. What I like to say at these meetings is if you know someone because domestic
violence victims are going to be very hesitant to ask for help especially from the Police. But
there are signs if you hear the yelling next door, if you see maybe a female or a male looking a
little disheveled, a little down or a little upset if could be a victim of domestic violence. You
know saying something to them and refer them in a confidential way could be helpful or you
can call our community affairs or domestic violence and we can discretely try to reach out to
them and offer services, that’s mainly the best way to help our neighbor’s. If you see someone
and you don’t want to wait until they’re assaulted so, if you see someone that’s having a hard
time maybe you try talking to them or reach out and try to offer services and resources that will
help them out of they’re situation, but we are seeing in the last month 53 percent in domestic
violence.
The last thing I have is grand larceny like I said in the last month we’ve seen a dramatic
increase; 11 more cars have been stolen last month compared to last year. I’m not sure
everyone is aware of the Tic Tock challenge, basically these kids go on these videos and on
these video’s they show you how to steal a vehicle and they eventually go and steal the car for
a joy ride, we’ve seen 11 additional people in our community just in the past month have
they’re Kia Fortes mostly stolen because of that Tic Tock challenge. Basically, the kids are just
taking it for a joy ride they think it’s a joke and when we do catch them and there doesn’t seem
many consequences either. We’re doing our best to try and put out awareness about this and
there’s a recall on these calls and they can reach out to their dealers there are ways of
protecting their car. The people that are my age will probably remember this we’re
recommending the old-fashioned clubs that people use to put on the steering wheel for the
cars are making a comeback, these young kids that are 14, 15 and 16 they don’t know what it is
they’ve never seen it before, and they seem to be ignoring that car. That’s all I have for a
report about what’s going on, I’ll put my number in the chat and you can always reach out if
you have any concerns and obviously community affairs is always available too.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said Deputy Inspector thank you for coming and I’m going to
open the forum for questions from Boardmembers.

Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said I want to thank you for coming and giving us a
comprehensive report tonight and as always you’re always welcome. The next item on the
agenda is the Housing Bureau Police.
Captain Herren, Executive Office PSA7 Housing Bureau Police, New York City Police
Department said good evening how is everybody I’ve been assigned here for about a year, and I
started my career in the 40th Precinct so it’s kind of nice to be back where I started.
Basically, everything we’re seeing in PSA7 along with what Deputy Inspector Tompkins just said
you know one shooting is obviously too many, but we are down 3 less shootings this year over
last year. The latest one over at 152 was a gang thing we hope to make an arrest on that in the
future. For these 28 days we have 7 vehicles 2 were scooters and the other 5 were Kia’s, like
the Inspector said if you have a Kia there’s updates for that to fix the keys so that not easily
stolen.
Then the only other thing I have is along with him we received 10 new officers straight out of
the academy, so you’ll see them out at the developments starting on Sunday.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said at this time any Boardmember that has a question raise
their hand.
Questions and Answers
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said now we’re going to move the agenda into the Committee
Reports. The first Committee Report is Economic Development-Land Use & Housing which has a
voting item, Mr. Perez you now have the forum.
Mr. Freddy Perez, Jr., Chairperson Economic Development-Land Use & Housing said the
committee meeting was at Lincoln Hospital on Wednesday, April 12th and we made quorum. I
want to make sure that I acknowledge her, thanks to Ms. Goodwin who recognized that I have
been having a problem establishing quorum and she asked her committee members to remainFULL BOARD

at the hospital so, we had quorum again thank you Brenda Goodwin for the Health Committee
and the members.
That night we had two presentations one was by Mr. Edward Poteat, Carthage Real Estate Advisors, LLC
and Unique People Services for the construction of a 10-story 106-unit building on 431 Concord Avenue.
In their presentation they stated that the building would be 100 percent housing with units at 60
percent AMI or lower with financing coming from a number of institutions HPD for income credits and
some grants. The population of the tenants as described were single individuals with mental health
issues. The many concerns by the Committee members range from parking, safety for other tenants
and the mixed use they will be renting to other tenants that don’t have any type of aliments. Security
and shadows created by the height of the building not in aligned with the rest of the neighborhood.
Construction would be $70 million dollars to begin the third quarter of 2024 and completed by the end
of 2026. A roll call vote was taken and as a result there were 14-no’s and 3-abstentions, and the letter
of support was denied by the committee. That concludes my first report.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said that at this time it’s the recommendation of the Economic
Development-Land Use & Housing Committee that we do not support that project. Is that
correct?
Mr. Freddy Perez, Jr., Chairperson Economic Development-Land Use & Housing Committee
said that’s correct the letter of support was denied by a roll call vote by the committee.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said so, at this time is there any questions regarding this matter
before we call the motion on the vote.
Motion made not to grant Carthage Real Estate Advisors, LLC and Unique People Services a
letter of support for the development of their project at 431 Concord Avenue. Motion duly
seconded. Motion called and passed with 3-abstentions.
Mr. Freddy Perez, Jr., Chairperson Economic Development-Land Use & Housing Committee
said for the second presenter was Ms. Tori Lyon of the Jericho Project for informational
purposes. This project is 84-units at 450 East 158th and 45-units at 407-409 East 158th Street all
100 percent affordable. There will be 78-units for supportive housing and 50-units for low
income. The supportive housing will be for adults 18-25 they will have 24-hour security,
outdoor rec space and job readiness programs. The presenters were very vague during their
presentation and many questions were never answered, and we requested that those answersFULL BOARD

be forwarded to the District Manager. If the District Manager can elaborate as to whether or
not he received any of the requested information and that will conclude my report Madam
Chair.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said so Mr. District Manager you have the forum can you give us
an update as to where we are with this matter.
Mr. Freddy Perez, Jr., Chairperson Economic Development-Land Use & Housing said I think
that it’s important for me to mention for the residents that the site is asbestos free.
Mr. Anthony R. Jordan, District Manager said that the Chair of the committee asked that the
District Manager along with Chair Parks be provided with additional information on this project
related to the financial information that was requested and I will share the information
momentarily.
The follow up to the request for the information that wasn’t provided on Monday, April 24th at
5PM the Community Board received the information requested regarding the funding the entity
that was setup is called the East 158th Street Affordable LLC a joint venture between the Jericho
project and the Azimuth Development Group. As mentioned the developer is Azimuth
Development Group and Jericho owns both development sites as mentioned in the proposal.
The construction financing secured for the project is New York State Housing Finance also
known as HFA, New York State Department of Homes and Renewal also known as ACR, the New
York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development also known as HPD and using
low-income housing tax credits, HTC Equity, the permanent financing is HFA. In addition, there
is financing being supported through the office of City Councilman Rafael Salamanca. In
addition to subsidy loans from 15/15 rental assistance through the New York City Department
of Human Resources also know as HRA and the New York City Department of Health & Mental
Hygiene. The project cost is estimated to be and currently at 38.4 but 68.5 there are no zoning
regulations in place, no additional parking. In addition to that the Board is in possession of the
architectural plans that are going to be proposed for the space and the space is being proposed
as affordable low-income housing. That concludes my information
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said just for clarification the property is as-of-right and the
developer owns the property. However, as the District Manager just stated there is a
significant amount of tax paying public dollars that are being used to build this housing. ThereFULL BOARD

Pg. 13
is the issue of the neighborhood being developed as homeowners all up and down Elton
Avenue are extremely upset that this development being put in their neighborhood they feel
will be a disruptive construction to their quality of life. They feel that the building is out of scale
with the rest of what was there and has been there for quite some time and they feel like
they’ve been left out of the decision-making process. The other thing is that there was a church
there from 1878 purchased that was also torn down that the community was working on very
passionately to try to get landmarked. So, now what discussions are taking place with respect
to the homeowners impacted by this development and the City Council person who represents
them. Mr. District Manager I believe that you gave us a report that they’re meeting with him.
Mr. Anthony R. Jordan, District Manager said that It’s my understanding that there was a
meeting with the City Councilmember and members of the community, the Community Board
was not part of that conversation.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said we need to find out because the recommendation for the
Community Board to write a letter because it’s tax levy monies and basically recommend that
the Councilman work together with the neighborhood residents so that something that is built
there they feel comfortable with as compared to the project that is going there. So, is that an
option at this point I’m asking Mr. District Manager.
Mr. Anthony R. Jordan, District Manager said Madam Chair however the decision of the Board
is on this issue whether there’s a letter that the Board wishes to draft to the Councilmember of
the Council specifically I’ll follow the directive of the Board.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said so, Mr. Perez what is your recommendation to the Board.
Mr. Freddy Perez, Jr., Chairperson Economic Development-Land Use & Housing said my
recommendation is that we write a letter to the local elected official who is Rafael Salamanca
expressing the concerns of the Board and the community about this project, we’re not happy
and there not happy. Maybe the Councilmember with the developer can restructure and
design what type of project this should be. Now you say that they’re already digging up that
hole time is of the essence here so, lets shoot out that letter as soon as possible.FULL BOARD
April 27, 2023
Pg. 14
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said so, let’s make a motion regarding this matter, can we get a
motion from the floor regarding sending a letter and it is customary that even though a project
is as-of-right that it’s tax paying money that is being used to build the project the Community
Board should always opine and act in our capacity as an advisory to this impacted community.
What would be the motion, is there a motion
Mr. Freddy Perez, Jr, Chairperson Economic Development-Land Use & Housing said Madam
Chair the motion is that Community Board 1 send a letter to our local elected official saying that
the project at 158th Street should be considered for some sort of modification in terms of
maybe height, population and engage the residents and homeowners of that neighborhood to
address their concerns. Motion duly seconded. Motion called and passed.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said let the record reflect that the motion was carried, and
Community Board 1 will write that letter requesting that we work with community and the
Councilperson for the district to see what can be done to have a project there that the
homeowners and the people that invested dollars in the neighborhood for the last two decades
get something there that they all can be proud of. Let’s move the agenda, the next committee
report is Education &Youth.
Mr. Anthony R. Jordan, District Manager said that Mr. Haymadi, Chairperson Education &
Youth was excused.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said in that case I will ask everyone to review the report and if
you have any questions regarding his report please feel free to call the District Manager or Mr.
Yahmadi and certainly if anyone has questions regarding any matter you may call me at any
time. Ms. Goodwin, Chair of the Health-Human Services & Seniors can you give your report.
Ms. Brenda Goodwin, Chairperson Health-Human Services & Seniors said I asked that all
members receive my report, Cardinal McCloskey was the presenter and they left outreach
numbers to be reached for any questions. We can be reached if anybody has any questions
about that meeting. I’d like to thank my committee at this time, they stayed for two meetings,
united we stand and that is my report.FULL BOARD

Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said does anybody have any questions for Ms. Goodwin
regarding her report. Thank you Ms. Goodwin. The last committee report and that has a voting
item is Municipal Services.
Ms. Carolyn Chamorro, Chairperson Municipal Services said good evening everyone, we had a
Ms. Leonardo from Breaking Ground property management made a presentation at the
committee meeting of March 10th requesting a letter of support for 2-3 drop off spaces in front
of their 445 East 142nd Street property to only be used for deliveries, emergency response
vehicles and ambulette/pickup services from 7 AM to 7 PM Monday through Friday.
The committee members present were against giving a letter of support due to the current
traffic congestion in that area.
Mr. Anthony R. Jordan, District Manager said as the Committee Chair said the organization
asked for our support for their petition to the Department of Transportation to reserve 3
parking spaces in a “No Standing” zone for loading and unloading emergency vehicles,
ambulances or access-a-ride. So, the ask was for a letter of support to the Department of
Transportation to put “No Parking” so that they will be able to use those 3 spaces for
emergency responders in addition to access-a-ride that would likely help to elleviate the traffic
congestion, the double parking and for people going in and out of the facility. The committee
voted not to provide a letter of support towards that ask.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson asked so, Ms. Chamorro you’re making the recommendation
from your committee to the Board not to support the Breaking Ground request.
Ms. Carolyn Chamorro, Chairperson Municipal Services said no I want them to support the
request, but I need to know if the traffic congestion is going to be remedied to try and give
them the 2-3 spaces and see how that goes.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said we must abide by the wishes of the committee. So, the
wishes of the committee was not to grant the request, so can we have a motion at this time
regarding this matter.FULL BOARD
April 27, 2023

Motion made to grant the 3 parking spaces requested by Breaking Ground. Motion duly
seconded. Motion called and passed with 2-abstentions.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said that now completes all the reports by the committee’s the
District Manager and the Chair and can I have a motion from the Board to accept all the reports
that have been presented.
Motion made to accept all the reports presented tonight. Motion duly seconded. Motion
called and passed.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said we’re now at number 10 on the agenda the Elected Officials
Reports. Is there anyone here from the Honorable Mayor’s office Eric Adams.
The representative from the office of the Honorable Eric Adams, Mayor for the City of New
York said good evening, how’s everyone doing tonight.
I just have one quick item that the mayor wanted me to bring up. I sent an email out to all the
Community Boards regarding the Neighborhood Support Teams (NST) Program and basically
what it is a link that anybody in the community can fill out and it asks for folks to submit any
quality-of-life issues that’s impacting their community. Basically, if we get enough entries on a
particular issue then we will be putting together kind of an interagency force to address that
issue. So, the important thing is there’s a deadline for May 31, so I really ask everyone to really
kind of select something that is of the highest importance and get as many folks as possible to
fill out this link so that it can be one of the items to be focused on in this NST project. That
pretty much sums up the report from the Mayor’s Office.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said thank you Mr. Coello and this is an opportunity that should
not be missed to address some of the quality-of-life issues faced in our neighborhoods. So, the
next report is the Honorable Vanessa L. Gibson, is there someone here.
The representative from the office of the Honorable Vanessa L. Gibson said on behalf of the
Honorable Vanessa L. Gibson it’s my honor to report that we’ve gone over half of the

of the Borough President welcome our District Manager to being part of the family and to Ms.
Annie whose been a stalwart person to the Community Board and again salute the leadership
of Ms. Arline Parks.
We’re in the process of working with the Mayor’s Office to continue to work on fire safety as
you know we lost major supermarkets and created food deserts in areas because of these E-
Bikes that are mismatching these chargers that cause fires we’re doubling down with
community meetings, senior meetings, meetings in NYCHA. We also had a luncheon yesterday
for NYCHA leadership working with them in terms of what’s going on with RAD, what’s going on
with the different processes. We’ve been dealing also with maternal health; infant mortality
rates is very high regarding the Black and Latino population of color especially in the Bronx
where there are food deserts. We want to increase food bucks for people and increase our
Farmers Markets, TSA’s so these are ongoing.
In regard to new development the MIH, Mandatory Inclusionary Housing that’s going up, I
know that there’s a lot of over saturation in the South Bronx as she said in the State of the
Borough on May 1st she’s looking to spread it to the other areas to stop oversaturation. That’s
my report Madam Chair.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said thank you for that report. Do we have any Boardmembers
with questions. Is there anyone here at this time from the Honorable Congressman Richie
Torres’s Office. Is there anyone here from the Honorable State Senator’s Office the Honorable
Jose M. Serrano.
The representative from the office of the Honorable Jose M. Serrano, State Senator said good
evening everyone. I would like to share some things about the legislation in Albany.
In March the Serrano bill was passed, this bill requires competence training for medical
professionals. There’s another thing also that touches our communities it’s the bill 1608 which
is the bill that authorizes Farmer Markets in local parks so we’re talking a lot about food
deserts. This bill we hope that in different parks in the Bronx that communities and people will
have access to fresh food through marketplaces.

Mr. Mohammed Sheikh, First Vice Chairperson said good evening everyone. I’m requesting for
a role and then I will turn the meeting over to Mr. Freddy Perez, Jr.
The roll was called and there was not a quorum.
Mr. Freddy Perez, Jr., Chairperson Economic Development-Land Use & Housing said that it’s
not on the agenda, but I got a call and I want to give this person an opportunity because I think
it’s important because we don’t have a quorum. Mr. Torres has some important information
regarding funding for the community, I’d like to give him two minutes of the Board’s time.
Mr. Alberto Torres said good evening everyone and I am on the board of the New York Yankee
Fund. It was created for us to be able to give funding to Community Based Organizations, that’s
something that the Elected Officials had negotiated when they built a new Yankee Stadium. I
have been on the board for three years and my outreach is to the Community Planning Board
for its members to be able to identify Community Based Organizations to get them the
application. Unfortunately, I do not have many submissions and a lot of the submissions are
coming from other Planning Boards with the grants being up to $15,000. The focus of the
grants basically are with reference to making a difference with our youth but must be a
program or project that is a 501 C3 however, if they’re not a 501 C3 they can have a conduit
receive the funding from which they can receive their monies. If anyone has an organization
that we should put on the list so that we could send them an application there are small and
large grants, and we need to get Planning Board 1 involved. I will send the application on Friday
to the Planning Board to be distributed, I thank you very much.FULL BOARD

now have a quorum.
The roll was again called and still 3 more persons were required for quorum.
Mr. Freddy Perez, Jr. said let’s move forward we have a presentation from the New York City
Department of Sanitation.
Mr. Juan Saldana, Assistant Supervisor Customer Service Unit, Bureau of Community Affairs
for the New York City Department of Sanitation said briefly I’m going to go over the new trash
schedule that will go into effect April 1st.
Currently, we put our trash out after 4 PM the day before your scheduled collection so, the new
rule will reduce the time that trash is obstructing sidewalks making our streets cleaner and
reducing the rats. There are two options for to set out trash the first option is after 6 PM in a
container of 55 gallons or less with a secure lid and the second option is after 8 PM in putting
the bags directly on the curb. For business they also have two options the first option is one
hour before closing in a container with a secure lid or after 8 PM putting bags directly on the
curb.
We’re continuing to conduct outreach for both residents and businesses with conversations
with community such as tonight, and mail to residents, property managers, businesses, paid
media campaigns covering print, digital, radio and public space advertising.
Now as far as enforcement goes based on feedback from businesses and residents, there will be
a one-month grace period to allow time to adjust, business and residents will receive only
written warnings during this time. Now, these written warnings will be tracked and those
previously warned will be among the first to be placed in compliance inspection in May. I’m
open to any questions or concerns.

Questions and Answers
Mr. Freddy Perez, Jr., Chairperson Economic Development-Land Use & Housing said we’ve
established a quorum, I’m going to move the agenda. Can I have a motion to approve the
agenda as presented.
Motion made to approve the agenda as presented. Motion duly seconded. Motion called and

Mr. Freddy Perez, Jr. said let the record reflect that the agenda was approved unanimously. I
need a motion to approve the February 23rd Full Board Minutes.
Motion made to approve the February 23rd Full Board Minutes as presented. Motion duly
seconded. Motion called and passed.
Mr. Anthony R. Jordan, District Manager said that we’re having a Public Hearing on the
application by Catholic Homes New York on a non-ULURP Modification to the Melrose Large-
Scale Residential Development (LSRD) and as-of-right proposed 193-unit Affordable Housing
Development.
Mr. Freddy Perez, Jr., Chairperson Economic Development-Land Use & Housing said just as a
note of clarification, this group came before the Economic Development committee this month
and made a presentation, but it could not be voted on because we did not have a quorum so, I
asked them to come before the Full Board with the Chairperson’s permission, that was granted.
So, let’s afford them the opportunity to make that presentation and it’s a voting item.
Public Hearing
Ms. Susan Albrecht said I oversee the development of new housing for Catholic Homes New
York, which is the housing office for Catholic Charities in the Archdiocese. I am joined today by
FULL BOARDMarch 30, 2023
Pg. 4
Joanna Clutter, Drew Kiriazides, and Emily Simons the Land Use Counsel for our application.
So, we’re here today to provide background on our non-ULURP Modification to the Melrose
Large Scale Plan to facilitate the development of a new 193-unit all affordable housing
development on the site of the Christopher Court apartments.
This is just a little bot of background about Catholic Homes New York our mission is to develop
and provide safe, affordable housing for families, seniors and people with special needs based
on our belief that have a home is a scared human right. We currently have 14 projects with
over 2,900 units of affordable housing for families and seniors. This is an example of 3 recent
projects on the left is Second Farms which was on a former parking garage at West Farms with
319 units of affordable housing, the one in the middle is St. Augustine Apartments which is on
the site of the former church and then the one on the far right is St. Vincent Paul Senior housing
located on the parking lot of the St. Vincent Paul Nursing Home.
So, the Melrose Urban Renewal Area and Large-Scale Residential Development Area was
established in 1969 by the New York City Department of City Planning. The plan identified a 20-
block area for large scale residential development. The boundaries are in west is Park Avenue,
North is East 156th Street, East is Morris Avenue and Alfred E. Smith playground, and South is
East 149th Street. The existing developments in LSRD are Michelangelo Apartments, Maria
Lopez Plaza, Christopher Court Apartments, Park Avenue Green Apartment, Morris Avenue
Apartments, 675 Morris Avenue and 3000 Park Avenue. So, now I’m going to ask my colleague
to talk about the current site conditions and the initial concept that we have for our new
development on this site.
Mr. Drew Kiriazides, Catholic Homes New York said thank you everyone for the opportunity to
present before you. So, what you’re seeing here is a full block with Park Avenue on the left and
the far right is Morris Avenue, and the red are 2 existing buildings Christopher Court on the far
left. Fronting Park is the existing parking lot of 48 spots, and we would relocate the 48 spots to
the southern portion of the site up again the alleyway that is closer to Michelangelo
apartments. It was mentioned earlier that it’s 193-units, the development is 13-stories and
we’re presenting a mix of incomes from 40 percent to 70 percent, it would have a percentage
of homeless and for this project that would be 29 units.
There would be landscaping of the courtyard which right now is just a grassy area, to fix the
walkways and create a variety of different passive and active recreational spaces, another key
element we’re proposing is access points from the street for tenants to use to get to the
courtyard, right now there’s an entrance to Christopher Court from Morris and we’re proposing
to have an entrance from 151st Street that would provide access to all the tenants of the
development.FULL BOARD
March 30, 2023
Pg. 5
Here’s an image of a floor plan of the new development, it’s a mix of 1 bedroom, 2 bedrooms
and 3 bedrooms and it will also have a laundry room, community room and the yards are just
immediately outside the and will be landscaped. Part of our goal here is to not just build a new
building but to create an integrated development that’s good for the whole Christopher Court
community so, we met with the tenants a few weeks back to present this and hear about their
ideas about it. The courtyard redesigning is a big part of this plan as well as you know, this is an
opportunity for our organization to provide affordable housing in the community and it will be
developed through city programs that will have like green rooms and solar cells. Here’s a little
more detail about the units as I mentioned before we’re targeting 40 percent to 70 percent and
as you see here for 1 bedroom this is low. The low number would be the unit at 40 percent and
higher number would be the same unit at 70 percent, we didn’t do that for the 2 bedroom and
3 bedrooms. What are organization does encourage in all our developments is to have the
required Community Board preference and we’re going to as we do in our other projects. So,
people know about it because it’s put in local papers, sent to your organization and a ton of
other community groups to know when the lottery is happening. We’re hoping for the
financing to be HPD through the ELLA Program a low-income housing program, we’ve had
discussions with the city, but it’s not yet been finalized.
We had a City Planning process for this non-ULURP Modification and they came up with
approvals based on certain categories that’s what you see here the project will provide greater
flexibility for better site planning, but it’s about how the density of this project is not to the
detriment of the community as it still complies with the 72 and the large scale plan and they
felt good about this project we’ve met with City Planning for a couple years on this. A plan has
been completed with City Planning and part of that was the Environmental Review that was
shared with you guys and that showed a negative declaration that this project would not have
an adverse impact. Part of the process is getting City Planning approval, meeting with the
Community Board to present it and then your vote would go to City Planning.
So, I just wanted to note that whenever there is a new development on a large-scale residential
development area, as we described we’re required to go through the process of non-alert
modifications. So, it’s slightly different than some of the other ULURP actions that I know the
Community Board reviews. So, we welcome your questions.
Mr. Freddy Perez, Jr., Chairperson Economic Development-Land Use & Housing said thank you
and asked does any Boardmember have any questions, please raise your hand and identify
yourself.

Mr. Freddy Perez, Jr., Chairperson Economic Development-Land Use & Housing said thank you
and we have to move the agenda. Mr. Jordan are you there?
Mr. Anthony R. Jordan, District Manager responded yes Mr. Chairman so, for the Public
Hearing we either have to vote yes or no for recommendations and if there are any
recommendations they should be one sentence recorded and forwarded to City Planning.
Mr. Freddy Perez, Jr. Chairperson Economic Development-Land Use & Housing Ms. Rojas will
begin the roll call vote on the Christopher Court Non-ULURP Modification to the Melrose Large-
Scale Residential Development (LSRD) and as-of-right proposed 193-Unit Affordable Housing
Development.
The roll was called with 13-Yes votes and 11-No votes, and one recommendation for Catholic
Homes New York to come back with the amount of federal funding and how much of that will
be used to hire locally. The item was passed.
The item was passed, and we will be issuing a letter of support for the modifications. I’d like to
thank the presenters for coming and hope that you keep us abreast of any new outcomes and
jobs. Mr. Jordan let’s move the agenda.
Mr. Anthony R. Jordan, District Manager said thank you Mr. Chairman, thank you ladies and
gentlemen.
I mentioned that I was making an overall comprehensive assessment of the work of the office
and I’m in the middle of that process, it has to be ongoing. After 25 years of service to this
community our Community Coordinator Ms. Ana Rojas is retiring. I have taken on the
responsibility of developing a job description for the next person who we be taking on that role
going forward so, we are working with that and passing that job description to the Executive
Committee. We will be bringing it to the Board when we are ready to announce the process of
the person who would likely be hired. It is my hope that the opportunity will be to have
someone who can serve before Ms. Rojas moves on with retirement so, that we can be able to
make sure that her retirement is seamless from the office, and we could have continuity of
services and resources. The Board passed a general operating budget for the office which
includes personnel and also I found the opportunity where I believe that would likely be some
savings. For the replacement there will likely be a special meeting called and at the same timeFULL BOARD

hopefully to have a resolution passed for the proposed budget to continue spending the rest of
the money for the fiscal year so, we’re excited about that. When I came on I promised a very
transparent and open seamless system and I will continue to provide that to the you as
Boardmembers.
I had an opportunity working with folks in our District Service Cabinet meeting where the
District Manager brings forward all the heads of the city agencies from parks and recreation to
schools to all our city services. They come before me in the early morning on the 2nd Tuesday of
each month for the opportunity of understanding of where city services are, and for me to be
able to bring your concerns as committee Boardmembers straight to the folks who make those
decisions for us and fight hard for what we expect for the Community Board so, I’m excited
about that.
Moving forward, I have an update from the Parks Department, as you may or may not know our
anchor park which is ST. Mary’s on St. Ann’s Avenue, Jackson and 149th Street has gone on with
an enormous amount of renovation and we’re excited about the work and investment that the
officials have made to hopefully make the park a cleaner central park. Originally there had
been some work to look at and now we’re excited to announce the completion of the west and
east sides of the park, and we’re excited about that happening. We’re returning to our
Borough Commissioner and Elected Officials about having a general opening as we get into the
spring season about what’s happening. We also have the Borough Commissioner and Chief of
Recreation coming forward to us in the next Community Board meeting to give and update
about what the plans are for the recreational center. We want to make sure that we have free
space and accessible recreational services in our city parks and open spaces.
We are in the final stages of moving forward to start live-streaming all Community Board and
Committee hearing meetings so, we’re working with our friends at YouTube and Facebook to
start live-streaming each of these conversations so, that we all understand about how
important it is to learn about what’s going on in the community and to hold our partners
accountable. Also, for our friends to know about the work we’re doing, we were excited to
make sure that this is happening so, we will be launching that very soon.
I’m going to move forward with the rest of the agenda, and I thank you for giving me the
opportunity to be able to share some of the work that’s been happening in the district and I’m
happy to answer any questions that the Boardmembers may have.
Mr. Freddy Perez, Jr., Chairperson Economic Development-Land Use & Housing asked do you
have any questions for the new District Manager? Having none, let’s move the agenda for
Committee Reports this is going to just take a few minutes.FULL BOARD

I met with the District Manager and the 40th Precinct regarding the vetting for 12 liquor license renewals
and new applicants on Wednesday, March 22nd, three business upon the recommendation of the 40th
Precinct were not approved for renewal because of either suspected prostitution, and at one of these
locations there had been a shooting. The reason that it didn’t go before the Committee was that we
needed to move on this quickly and the 40 Precinct went and checked on each location prior to the
meeting.
Mr. Anthony R. Jordan, District Manager said we also should be aware that under New York
State Law the Community Boards will also be seeking to get recommendations for approval or
denial of Cannabis Licenses and I would like to invite the NYPD into those conversations for
consideration when making those recommendations. I thank the Chairman for his time.
Mr. Freddy Perez, Jr., Chairperson Economic Development-Land Use & Housing said that I
want to make clear that the applications that come in the future will go before the Economic
Development-Land Use & Housing Committee and then we will bring it up to the Full Board, but
in this case it was time sensitive. I need a motion from the floor to accept the locations that
were approved by the NYPD for renewal or new liquor license.
Motion made to approve the recommendations of the NYPD of renewal or new liquor license
applicants. Motion duly seconded. Motion called and passed with two abstentions.
Let’s move the agenda, Education Committee.
Mr. Hakiem Yahmadi, Chairperson Education & Youth Committee said we had the
Superintendent come and speak about what’s happening in the district with the schools. One
thing highlighted was attendance and in the district as of February 27th it was at 90 percent
versus citywide at 89.6 percent, and he talked about the chronic absences. He also spike about
a $90,000 dollar grant that will be distributed between 4 or 5 schools and a number of other
schools that were awarded grants. He wants the community to know that part of his mission is
to make sure that the children know how to read.
We also had the Literacy Academy Collective is a group of 6 moms promoting reading for
children with dyslexia. They are planning on opening a new school The South Bronx Literacy
Academy. They’re doing some work at PS 161 and their vision is to continue to support working
with the PS161 community and are working on the possibility of launching an adult literacy arm
as well. Looking to create some workshops with families where they can get some supportFULL BOARD

with reading. They are requesting a letter of support for the new school and the Committee
voted to provide them with one with one.
Mr. Freddy Perez, Jr., Chairperson Economic Development-Land Use & Housing asked are
there any questions. Let’s move on to the Elected Officials Reports. Is there anyone here from

Underserved and Impact of Staff Vacancies and Agency Performances so, if you’re interested in
that report I will put it in the chat. We also released another report entitled Accounting for an
Island Seeker and in this analysis the Comptroller detailed the city’s budget, contracts and
services to date. The Comptroller also called on city officials to focus on scaling up efforts to
transition New Yorkers out of shelters into permanent housing as well as coordinating efforts to
help you arrive with supply for asylum and work authorization so, if you’re interested in this
report it’s also on the website. Lastly we’ve also released an Aging New York survey, we’re

February 23, 2023
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said welcome everybody, can you just mute yourselves so that
we don’t get the feedback and the interruptions, thank you. The Full Board meeting is now
officially started at 6:06 PM.
The roll was called and there was a quorum.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said can we have a motion for approval of the agenda.
Motion made to approve the agenda as presented. Motion duly seconded. Motion called and
passed.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said that the next item on the agenda is the January Full Board
meeting minutes, can I have a motion for approval.
Motion made to approve the January Full Board meeting minutes as presented. Motion duly
seconded. Motion called and passed.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said that the next item on the agenda is my report, I want to
start off by following up with an issue that came up at the last meeting and it involved a project
on 156th street.At the time the inquiry was made about the project we didn’t have the particulars, now we
have more information in fact it came before the Board twice. The first time they came it was
just informational, meet and greet and trying to figure out what the Board wanted in terms of
FULL BOARD
February 21, 2023
Pg. 2
development at that location. The second time they appeared in December of 2022 and again,
it was more of a meet and greet without any specificity about the project. There actually
homeowners that live on the block and that church has been a part of the fabric of that
neighborhood for over 20 some years. When they found out that there was a potential for the
site to be sold, they wrote to the Landmarks Commission because the church is so distorted,
and they wanted to preserve it so, they wrote that letter in 2020 and the Landmarks
Commission has yet to respond to them and their inquiry.
It’s my understanding that they want to put supportive housing for veterans with maybe some
set aside for homeless families. It's my further understanding from residents that live on the
block that there was no outreach to the homeowners there. So, what we are proposing to do
to move the issue going forward is one the Jericho Project has been in touch with Community
Board 1, and we are now going to have them back before the next Economic Development-
Land Use & Housing committee meeting. To get full disclosure and representation of what
they’re actually going to build there on that site, how it’s going to be financed, the
environmental issues that might be there as a result of them tearing down the church on the
site, and we’re also reaching out to the Landmarks Commission to find out why there was no
follow up to the letter that was submitted by the residents regarding the landmark of that
church. We’re also going to be reaching out to the Department of Homeless Services because
while the site is an as-of-right development site it is being financed by tax levy money at which
point the Community Board has the right to weigh in and give advice to the agencies. So, we’re
going to have them come before the Economic Development committee meeting we’re going
to invite all the homeowners as well, then we’ll do our due diligence and just follow up with all
parties concerned.
The next item that I’m so happy to report on is in response to everybody’s concerns about the
lack of services not being provided to the district and some other issues. I had a meeting with
the Borough President Vanessa Gibson, it was a great meeting she wanted to know what our
issues were, and I was able to articulate to her about the traffic congestion issues, the support
of housing concerns, public safety concerns all of which she really understands. She’s heard
and her goal is to listen and to work with the community to the best of her ability that was
conveyed to me. So, one of the things I told her that was eminent for us was St. Mary’s Park it
was a concern, and that a community resident had written a letter and took pictures of what
happens in that park on a daily basis, and she had a copy of the letter. So, I asked on behalf of
the district if we could start by showing some good faith an getting that needle receptor
program removed for safety issues and just overall cleanliness of the park. So, I’m proud toannounce that as we speak this week they took those receptacles out of that park and they’re
no longer there, that’s a win for the community. We had Park Rangers in there that were
dealing with all the other issues just to make sure that we take that park back and make it a
FULL BOARD
February 23, 2023
Pg. 3
safe haven. I also recommended that signage is put up in the parks regarding no drugs. As I
said there was a letter that was so brilliant that was sent out and all the Elected Officials were
included it resulted in the park getting cleaned up and that’s the end game. We need a safe
haven in Mott Haven where everybody can go there walk freely and just enjoy that we’ve got a
$30 million dollar investment in that park and so the Parks Department is going to make the
effort to really maintain the park so, I think that’s a win for the community.
So, the next thing I want to basically discuss is the State of the Borough announcement which is
going to take place on March 1st, we sent you the notice about it and I encourage everybody
from Community Board 1 to be there to support the Borough President and her first State of
the Borough address. That concludes my report for tonight. Mr. Jordan you have the floor.
Mr. Anthony R. Jordan, District Manager said thank you Madam Chair, ladies and gentlemen
it’s amazing to join you all today as your District Manager. I want to thank you for the honor to
serve you and this community which I grew up in and worked in for many years. So, I’m excited
about the work ahead and I appreciate your trust in me to be able to serve as your District
Manager.
Some of the work that I’m working on going forward we are currently working on assessing
what could be some budget needs for the office as we look at the equipment and all the needs
of this district as it begins to grow by leaps and bounds and all the housing and other things
that are being developed. We are evaluating some techniques and some other opportunities
for staff training and so on. I’m excited about looking and assessing how we can find savings
and the best use of your tax dollars to the city and this district to be able to do the work to
make sure that we have ascertained the municipal services required. I’m going to on my own
making a tour of the entire district so, you’ll see me near your business. This is making general
District Manager assessments to ensure that we could look at how traffic is flowing throughout
the district, other municipal services, problems and issues. But, I would like to have your input
if there are areas within the district that you would like me to visit specifically please feel free
to email me using the Community Board email address at brxcb1@optonline.net. So, this is not
just a one-day thing, it’s going to be an on-going thing because the job as I see it is not always
being in the office. The district is huge and I’m a visual learner so, this work has to be done
outside in the community and you need to see me and touch me because I serve as a District
Manager. So, I’m excited about that and I look forward to you guys’ input in several places, but
I’m going to be all around the district so look for me hopefully buy me a sandwich, a cup ofcoffee of course within the guidelines of the ethics but I look forward to visiting and touring the
district. Then in April we plan on doing a district tour with you as Community Boardmembers,
we need you to know passionately intimately what the district consists of and so, please
FULL BOARD
February 23, 2023
Pg. 4
prepare as in the coming days you’re going to receive a request to reserve a day on a weekend
in April to be able to go out and see this district. You can’t do the job effectively and efficiently
as you could unless you know what the district consists of, where our businesses are, where
cultural institutions are, where essentially we need to focus our resources at. So, I’m glad for
each of you to passionately be able to go out and see what’s happening in your district and
excited about the work ahead and I can’t wait to make that happen. I wanted to also
emphasize some important dates coming up soon and I’m sure the Borough President’s Office
will talk more about this, if you are looking at getting reappointed, if your membership to the
Board is expiring those applications need to be electronic and done by March 3rd we haven’t
heard back that date has been extended. But right now, that’s our understanding that you
need to make sure you fill out this application online and we’re excited about that work ahead.
Again, I’ll be around the district visiting to assess what is happening around the district and
where we can best focus our principal services and reporting back to you more about what’s
happening around the district, but also some of the things that are coming about and in this
district.
I’m very leadership inclusive District Manager so this Board works not only because of the great
staff we have had here for a long time, but each of you doing it for the shared responsibility of
making this a strong district and strong Community Board. So, I look forward to your help and
everyone’s leadership and engagement and Madam Chair that concludes traditional
management report.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson asked is there any questions that anybody has of Mr. Jordan at
this time, okay let’s move the agenda. We’re now going into the Public Hearing session with
Transit District 11 of the New York City Police Department around subway safety. Police Officer
Caceres you have the floor.
Police Office Caceres, New York City Police Department Transit Bureau 11 said I just pretty
much wanted to talk to everybody today about us and safety especially at the 138th subway
station and the Grand Concourse lines, those are the areas that Transit District 11 covers. Right
now, we’re seeing our biggest issue is cellphones with people who have them out and aren’t
aware of their surroundings especially when the stations are crowded. If the train is pulling into
the station and you’re sitting by the door the train pulls in and the door opens, and somebody
grabs your phone and runs off the train. Not only do we not get a good description becausenormally they don’t see the person that did it. It’s hard because we have to join video
campuses working with the Detectives to try to figure out how to get their phone. I know that
a lot of people have their personal lives on their phone and that’s just property that is kind of
FULL BOARD

Pg. 5
hard to replace just for sentimental values and for the dollar value as well. Then also the
person with bags pulling out their wallets and phones and they’re just not knowing what’s
going on and this just doesn’t happen in our district but also happens on the 4 lines in district 4
going all the way down to lower Manhattan as well. So, just want to make sure everybody’s
aware of that issue to be protective and safe on the trains.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson asked is that the extent of your report?
Police Officer Caceres, New York City Police Department Transit Bureau 11 said yes unless
anybody has any questions.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said do the Boardmembers have any questions?
Questions and Answers
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said thank you for coming and making your presentation tonight.
Let’s move the agenda to committee reports and the first is Economic Development-Land Use &
Housing, Mr. Perez you have the floor.
Mr. Freddy Perez, Jr., Chairperson Economic Development-Land Use & Housing said thank you
Madam Chair. So, the committee met on Wednesday, February 8, 2023, there was a quorum
and on the agenda were two voting items.
The first presentation was made by Mr. Joshua Dardashtian of the Dash Real Estate Group, Inc.
it was his second time coming, they had also presented in the prior month. He was requesting
a letter of support to the Landmarks Preservation Commission recommending approval of the
renovation, restoration and the addition to the current 4-story building located at 427 East
140th street. It will become a 10-unit condominium project with each unit having central heat,
AC, washing machines, dryers with modern kitchen appliances, hardwood floors, high efficiency
windows and the building will have a Central Station fire alarm sprinkler system.They purchased the building for $1.17 million dollars and are not requesting any government
funding, the total project costs would be $4.4 to $5 million dollars. The project sales price for
FULL BOARD

each unit to be between three hundred and seventy-five thousand and seven hundred and
seventy-five thousand dollars.
The questions by my committee members were related to warranty on appliances in the condo,
non-payment of mortgages and maintenance fees all of which were answered by Mr.
Dardashtian to the members satisfaction. A motion to approve the letter of support was made,
seconded, a vote was taken, and the motion passed with 13-yes and 1-no with no abstentions.
A second presentation was supposed to be made but they were not present.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson asked is there a recommendation being made on this matter for
a letter of support from the Full Board with respect to this project.
Mr. Freddy Perez, Jr., Chairperson Economic Development-Land Use & Housing said yes it’s a
letter of support for the Landmarks Preservation Commission.
Motion made by Mr. Freddy Perez, Jr., on behalf of the committee for giving a letter of support
to the Landmarks Preservation Commission recommending approval of the renovation,
restoration and addition to the project. Motion duly seconded. Called and passed with 16-Yes,
6-Oppositon, and 2-Abstentions. Motion passed.
Mr. Freddy Perez, Jr., Chairperson Economic Development-Land Use & housing said so, that
concludes my report.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said the next committee report is Education & Youth, he’s
excused, and his report went out to all the members so please read it. The next item on the
agenda is the Health-Human Services & Seniors committee report. Ms. Goodwin you have the
floor.
Ms. Brenda Goodwin, Chairperson Health-Human Services & Seniors said thank you, the
meeting was held on February 14, 2023, and there was one presenter Ms. Barbara Baer, HomeSharing Program Director for New York Foundation for Senior Citizens Home Sharing Program
and all the members should have received the report.
FULL BOARD
February 23, 2023
Pg. 7
The presentation was on the Home Sharing Program which is finding people that want to share
a room in their house with a senior who may need somewhere to stay. She explained about
the rents, the senior incomes and how people are being overwhelmed and not really having a
place to stay. The agency handles all the particulars with the host as well as with the person
who needs to share a room. Thank you, that concludes my report.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson asked does anyone have any questions for Ms. Goodwin at this
time? So, I’m going to address the Municipal Services committee because I think it’s very key,
very crucial.
There was a request made by the Fire Department to change the traffic direction of Courtlandt
Avenue so that they could respond to fires a lot quicker. At the request of the Board we sent
out a letter to the DOT Bronx Borough Commissioner Keith Kalb to address the issue and what
they’ve agreed to do was a couple of things 1) they’re not going to make any changes until after
they have in fact conducted a study of the area to ensure that what they are recommending is
not going to cause other traffic problems and that whatever their findings are they agreed to
come back to the Board before they actually make any changes; and number 2) they also
agreed because of the environmental and traffic congestion issues that we’re having all over
the district to take a tour of the district so he can see what we experience and have to live
through. He was adamant that the overall direction, the policy of the city is to reduce traffic
congestion and have everybody take mass transit. So, we’re going to keep lobbying our calls to
get changes where we can basically have a good quality of life here like everybody else enjoys
throughout the City of New York. But again, that was pretty much in response to the Board’s
concern about the congestion and the need to have a traffic study done of that area before any
changes were made to accommodate the Fire Department. So, that concludes the Municipal
Services report. Does anybody have any questions? Okay, let’s move the agenda the next
portion is the Elected Officials reports.
The representative from the Office of the Honorable Eric Adams, Mayor of the City of New
York said good evening, I just want to say welcome to Mr. Jordan, I look forward to working
with you sir I’ll send you a communication so we can setup some sort of meeting and I would
love to participate in a tour of the district as well. If anybody has any questions, I will be online,
thank you so much.Questions and Answers

The representative from the Office of the Honorable Vanessa Gibson, Bronx Borough
President said good evening everyone, two of the items I was going to mention were discussed
today, but I’ll just fill in a few of the details. The doors open at 5 PM, the speech is going to
start at 6 PM in the college the Borough President’s State of the Borough address. The other
thing is that the online applications are due as of now on March Friday, March 3rd and it only
takes 5 minutes to complete. A lot of Community Boards specifically coming to Board 1 have a
lot od complaints about overnight truck parking, there’s a survey online it’s supposed to close
tomorrow, but we’re hoping that maybe they’ll extend it so we can continue to get the word
out. And make sure that the community is heard on this survey. I’ll try to find the link in the
chat, or I’ll send it to the District Manager. Finally, I’ll say that we have a new Community
Board Director Ms. Gannon, you know where our offices are and we have a few things coming
up in March after the State of the Borough so, stay tuned for that, and I’ll put my information in
the chat. I’m here to answer any questions.
Questions and Answers
The representative from the Office of the Honorable Jose M. Serrano, State Senator said good
evening and there were requests from the last Full Board meeting about class size, Peaker
Plants, and the Randall and Ward Islands. So, one of our staff members spoke to Senator
Robert Jackson’s office about classroom size and they said that they had sent a letter on
January 5th, and they have not still received any response from the Department of Education,
after the Congress met with the Chancellor the office followed up with Mark Tracker and he
said that he’s waiting for an answer from the Department of Education leadership to respond.
So, Senator Jackson’s office wants to send a follow up email this week regarding that issue.
Then the Peaker Plants that’s the other thing so, they entered into an agreement with
Environmental Justice organization in 2020 to try to replace Peaker’s with battery storage by
2030 that was the plan, there are other plans to close by 2030 or 2035. Many environmental
groups as you know do not want the Peaker Plants to be renewed at all and there is currently a
push against the renewal of the permit this year. So, the Senator toured the Peaker Plants with
We Act for Environmental Justice last month and he’s knowledgeable on the negative health
impacts that it creates in the South Bronx, we are aware of that so, we’re working on that with
the mayor’s office.As always we are more than happy to hear opinions or ideas from the Community Board and its
members. Do you have any questions feel free to ask me anything?

Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said thank you for following up on those issues and for an
excellent report. Does anyone have any questions for Mr. Lopez at this time? Finally, New York
City Council representatives.
Honorable Deputy Speaker and Councilwoman Diana Ayala said thank you and good evening
Madam Chair, members of the Board I’m happy to be here with you all today and I wanted to
first and foremost congratulate and welcome Anthony Jordan to the role of the District
Manager. I ‘ve had the pleasure of working with him for many, many, many years and he’s an
outstanding human being with a heart of gold, very knowledgeable on the community and its
issues. I’m that you know he’s going to be a great value to us all so, welcome Anthony.
I wanted to just offer that my office has been having conversations with Borough President
Gibson about hosting a job fair because as you know and mentioned there is a shortage of
workers that’s not only impacting the agencies but also our non-profit organizations. So, we
have had that conversation and we’re happy to collaborate on doing something locally.
I also wanted to point out as we’ve seen our gun violence numbers are continuing to rise,
they’ve already started, and the summer is not even here. We want to make sure that we’re
employing as many young people as possible and getting them off the streets.
I’m sure that you know that there is something that is important to the Community Board in
regard to St. Mary’s Park and the opioid crisis. I want to thank Carmen Santiago. We’ve also
been in contact with the Parks Department it’s a very difficult situation that’s happening not
only in St. Mary’s, but in multiple Parks throughout the city. Ms. Simpson is on the line and she
and I worked tirelessly on mediating a lot of these conditions also at Patterson Playground and
it's something that primarily impacts most of my district, it tends to get a little bit better and
then it gets worse. The introduction of sentinel obviously has made it very difficult because it’s
so powerful that the substance abusers really love how it feels and they continue to go to it
really taking the chances that they won’t survive. Now there’s something that’s coming out in
the market that’s being introduced that eats at your skin so, it creates a bacteria in your own
body and is deadly. So, we will continue to do our due diligence to be out there not only
ensuring that we are addressing the public safety concerns, but also engaging with folks that
really need help that don’t yet understand, and you know how desperately they need the help.I wanted to just share there was a report of arrears that has been happening citywide so, we
did receive a list of developments in our district. A lot of people lost their jobs and they’re
having a lot of difficulty, but when you live or have section 8 you always have the ability to have
your rent reduced if you lose you income or there’s a change. So, I want to encourage folks to
go to the management office and make sure to let them know there has been a change, a
FULL BOARD
February 23, 2023
Pg. 10
significant change in income coming into the household so that we’re not accumulating arrears.
There are so many programs and services in the community BronxWorks is excellent in this
Home-Based Program and also offers One Shot Deals that can help pay back because we want
to make sure that people are not taken to court unnecessarily and evicted. One of the things
that we specifically hear from this Board is the over saturation of shelters. Well, we have right
now the highest census of people in shelters that we’ve ever had in the City of New York, and
we want to make sure that we’re working to reduce it and not to continue to add to it. So,
we’re working on a few legislative pieces right not that we’re hoping will kind of help address a
lot of the root causes of homelessness, and so that we’re able to keep people in their homes
while also addressing the reasons why they can’t move out of the shelters. I know that’s
something that you guys have been advocating for a long time.
The existing parking lot on 187th street will be transitioned over to the city, and we’ll be turned
into a youth hub and the hub will be modeled after the Door, which is a program that in in the
Lower Eastside and we have an annex in the South Bronx as well. It would offer, you know
obviously places where young people can go in and get a resume done, it will also offer mental
health service is obviously a free clinic. A lot of the young people from the South Bronx travel
into East Harlem to the adolescent health clinic because they don’t find those resources readily
available in their own communities. We also want to give them the tools they need to find jobs
to complete their education, if that’s something that they’re interested in and in a safe space
that understands their unique needs of being a young adult, it’s a very complicated process.
Then the Lincoln Recovery Center, there was an RFP that was issued, and we were successful in
securing $5 million dollars towards the renovations of that building, the total cost of
renovations is $18 million right now. I’m hoping that this year we’ll be able to obtain a
significant amount of money to be added to the $5 million. The RFP hasn’t been designated
yet, so we don’t know who’s going to get it, but whoever does they will ultimately also have to
put in some funds. So, my hope is to try to make it as easy as possible considering that this is
going to be a community resource that’s going to house a lot of our non-profit groups that right
now are literally in the church basements because they can’t afford a brick-and-mortar
location.
I just want to give you two last things we’re doing free tax services at the office in partnership
with Urban Outbound on Tuesday’s and Thursdays between 10 and 4, we’re getting some
traction so could share this with your networks, that would be great, it’s free of charge. Thelast finally obviously the application process for reappointments are ongoing. I want to
encourage folks that apply that we’re looking to ensure that members we’re appointing to the
Board are participating and that they are attending meetings. With that I conclude my report

The roll was called and there was quorum.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said thank you for attending and allowing us to meet our
quorum for tonight’s meeting. Can I have a motion to approve tonight’s agenda.
Motion made to approve the agenda. Motion duly seconded. Motion called and passed.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said let the record show that the Board approved tonight’s

unanimously voted for Anthony Jordan as the next District Manager for Community Board One
and his start date is February 20th. The next announcement is that at the next Full Board
meeting Community Board One’s meeting will then be live streamed on YouTube.
In addition, many of you may have received notice that your current term on Community Board

online portal. The reappointment application must be completed and submitted through this
portal by March 30th, if you wish to be considered for reappointment. You should also be
reminded that the completion of the required New York City Sexual Harassment training course
and the signing of the policy acknowledged form are requirements for your reappointment on
the Board. If you have any questions or choose not to reapply you must contact Tom Lucania
and his number is 718-5906005 or his email tlucania@bronxbp.nyc.gov. Thank you for your
service to the Community Board and please go online and reapply to the Board.
I would just like to say as an important reminder that we have been having difficulties in making
quorum and what we’re going to do is take a critical look at attendance on the Board and as
you know you’re required to serve on a committee and attend Board meetings and if you can’t
attend a Board meeting you have to ask to be excused. So, Boardmembers have asked me to
look into the attendance and then send out notices by March if members are not attending. I
just wanted to say that there will be recommendations for members who are not attending to
be removed from the board for non-attendance, so that we can make quorum monthly.
Also, the Office of Cannabis Management will be coming to Community Board One to discuss
cannabis opportunities and regulations. I will be meeting with the Borough President’s Office
to discuss district issues here. I’m encouraging all of the Boardmembers present to just send
me an email with all of your current concerns no matter what it is so, that it can be discussed
with the Borough President’s Office.
Then just finally as a follow up where we had a request by the Fire Department to change the
street over where they’re located at, and your request was to reach out to the NYC Department
of Transportation and have them conduct a study of the Fire Department request but also of
the 3rd Avenue corridor. So, Keith wrote back and acknowledged our concerns and request,
they will be performing a study of that area and then come back to present their findings to the
Board. They will not make any changes until they come before the Municipal Services
Committee. We will be inviting all the Boardmembers to that meeting not only to discuss the
Fire Departments request, the 3rd Avenue corridor but to have a substantive discussion
regarding all traffic issues in the district. That being said let’s move the agenda to Committee
Reports, the first will be the Economic Development-Land Use & Housing Committee.
Committee Reports
Mr. Freddy Perez, Jr., Chairperson Economic Development-Land Use & Housing Committee
said the meeting was on Wednesday, January 11th. The first presentation was made by Mr.FULL BOARD

January 26, 2023
Pg. 3
Matthew Washington representing Phipps Houses with an update on the status of the
development of two buildings, the first is a 169-unit senior building 12 stories high with 14 units
per floor, two elevators maybe three. The second project would be adjacent, and it would be at
63 Exterior Street 334 units family building 18-stories. They made their initial presentation on
November 10, 2021. It was listed as an update it then changed for a request for a preliminary
letter of support so that they could include it in their application to HPD for sole source
designation meaning one parcel was purchased and the other is city owned. Because of the
proximity the developer wants to request that the city let them combine the projects through
sole source without having to dispose of the parcel by and open RFP process.
I made it clear to the presenters that CB1 and in consultation with the Board Chair, who Chaired
my committee for over 20 years did not feel comfortable giving out a preliminary letter of
support before the ULURP process begins. The presenters went on and gave us the details
again regarding the project. The members of the committee voiced they’re opposition and
their concerns of parking spaces, traffic, no schools in the area, flooding, the difficulty of
emergency vehicles passing through the narrow block. The square footage specifically in the
senior building of 350 to 400 square feet for a studio and 500 square feet for one-bedroom.
When the presenters were finished I asked if any member felt comfortable with making a
motion to either grant a preliminary letter of support or deny them a letter of support, none
was made.
The second presentation was made by Mr. Joshua Dardashtian of Dash Real Estate Group, Inc.
for renovation, restoration adding a 4-story edition from an adjacent vacant lot. The building at
427 East 140th Street, between Brook and Willis Avenues has landmark status and he is
requesting a letter of support for his project to include the landmark and historical application,
the project would be 4-floors and 10 condominiums. The price of the condos ranging from
$375,000-$775,000 dollars. Their presentation was made to request a letter of support and the
project is listed in their handout as-of-right with no government funding and no tax abatement.
The committee was concerned with the following no super, they didn’t know the square
footage of each unit, they didn’t know the maintenance fee and no support from local Elected
Officials. The residents of Mott Haven or the South Bronx would never be able to quality or
even afford this type of purchase. A motion was made not to give a letter of support, we took a
vote, but the vote was not valid because we didn’t have a quorum. We requested that the
presenter come back on February 8th and that he would be presenting first. That concludes my
report Madam Chair.FULL BOARD

Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said thank you Mr. Perez for the report. So, we have a report
from the Municipal Services Chair?
Ms. Carolyn Chamorro, Chairperson Municipal Services said on January 9th we had the Interim
Commission for the New York City Department of Transportation talking about the Carshare
Program launched in 2018 with Zipcar and Enterprise Carshare and they are proposing 8 sites in
Community Board One.
It was explained that Carshare provides on-demand, short-term access to a shared fleet of
vehicles typically through a membership and hourly or annual. There are 230 on-street spaces
and 55 municipal parking facility spaces.
Each site is two parking spaces, and it was concluded that for every 1 car shared vehicle, 4
personal vehicles were either not purchased or sold.
We had a second presentation from the New York City Department of Environmental
Protection. They manage New York City’s water supply providing approximately 1 billion
gallons of drinking water each day to homes and businesses throughout the five boroughs. DEP
also protects sewer lines. They also enforce the air and noise codes as well as the asbestos
rules to protect the health and safety of New Yorkers.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said let us have a motion from the Boardmembers to accept the
Committee Reports as presented.
Motion made to accept the Committee Reports as presented. Motion duly seconded. Motion
called and passed.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said that the Committee Reports presented were unanimously

The representative for the Honorable Mayor Eric Adams said good afternoon just a quick
message from the mayor there is an initiative that he put out, his vision is that he wants to be
able to filter all information down to every single resident and not have to worry about things
being skewed through the media or other places. So, please go online and register, once you
put your email in you’ll be getting the right information. Thank you so much and have a good
night.
Questions and Answers
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson asked is there a representative from the Borough President’s
Office?
The representative from the Honorable Borough President Vanessa L. Gibson said yes hi, good
evening everyone. I know it was a long process and people put a lot of hours of labor into it so,
congratulations on selecting a District Manager.
So, a couple of quick announcements we have moved the Community Board application online.
For those that still want to do the paper route, that’s still an option. But the online application
allows a few things, number 1, it’s very user friendly I’m sure that anybody could do it. There is
a part where you have to upload a picture you can probably use your phone for that, you have
to upload a proof of address. You don’t want to necessarily rush through it give yourself maybe
5 or 10 minutes to fill it out. We’re going to be sending notification to all the Boardmembers
that have to reapply.
So, other quick announcements, we have a couple of cultural events that are happening in the
month of February, we have a Dominican Heritage event that’s going to happen, but I think that
they’re still trying to finalize the location and then there’s going to be an African American
Heritage event also happening, it’s February 23rd. Once we have the exact location and
information I’ll make sure to share it with the Chair and DM.
The Borough President is preparing for her first ever State of the Borough the date and time is
still coming, that information should be forthcoming soon. Again, I’ll make sure once we have
all the information finalized to share it with the Chair and DM.

Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson asked if there anyone from the NYC Comptroller’s Office.
The representative from the NYC Comptroller’s Office the Honorable Brad Lander said yes,
good evening everyone I do have one update from our office. We released a Heat Code
Enforcement Report on January 9th which was the anniversary of the Twin Parks fire as we all
know. In that report it analyzes heat, cold complaints, violations and interventions. Between
2017 and 2021 some key findings were that in a small percentage of buildings lack of heat was
persistent and severe. It describes that there was difficulty in turning 301 complaints about
lack of adequate heat into actual violations, specific examples in the report. There’s also a list
of recommendations that our office provides to help alleviate these issues and I will put the link
of the report in the chat for everyone to review and I’ll put my contact information in as well.

Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson asked is there anyone here from the Public Advocates Office? Is
there someone here from City Councilman Rafael Salamanca’s Office?
Honorable City Councilman Rafael Salamanca said hi, good evening everyone I think I’m the
only Elected Official that is present here today. First, I want to wish everyone Happy New Year.
I know that the Borough President’s Office spoke about the application process just know that
those that have been appointed by my office I look at attendance for the basis of
reappointment and again you know that quorum is important. Look what happened with the
Land Use Committee you could not vote because there was no quorum established. So, I really
hope that those that are interested in applying for the Community Board take it extremely
serious so, that the Board business can get done.
I’m going to be very quick just to speak about some legislations that I’ve introduced in the
Council one of them we know that gun violence has been showing up in our communities just
last week in my Council District a 15-year-old was shot. In less than one year in my district
alone I’ve had two 15-year old’s and one 11-year-old killed. Last year a young lady Julie Yamba
was killed in Melrose, last year in May an 11-year-old was also killed and his past Thursday a
young man was killed. Just know that my office is working closely with the Police Department
and the District Attorney’s Office to see how we can get leads so that we can resolve these
killings, but most importantly how to get guns off our streets. I introduced the bill with my
colleague Carina Rivera which will require NYPD to host a gun buyback program once a month
in every borough and we all know that when you surrender that firearm there’s a monetary
compensation that’s given to you and the bill will require that the NYPD pay the monetary
reward out of their own budget that could be negotiated. I’m not saying that that’s going to
resolve the issues, but its just thinking out of the box, thinking about how to get some of these
guns off our streets.
I also introduced another bill which is called a 50 Raffle Bill and I’m pretty sure that many of you
go to parties where you get to play bingo and they sell tickets and if you win that raffle you get
50% of the winnings and the other 50% of the winnings stays in the house. Well in the City of
New York it’s illegal for sports venues to do this at Yankee Stadium or Barclays they’re not
allowed to have these types of raffles, but in Buffalo and other stadiums outside of New York
City and across the country they do this. The beauty about this is that we get this bill passed
what’s going to happen is let’s say you go to Yankee Stadium or City Field and you are the
winner of that raffle you would get 50% of those winnings the other 50% will not stay with the
Yankees but will go directly to that immediate community. So that bill was introduced lastFULL BOARD

week it’s waiting to get a hearing and hopefully we will get a hearing and we get something
done with that.
Then finally I heard earlier it was a conversation and there was questions and I believe it was
actually the Mayor’s Office about the issue that we’re having on the HUB 149th Street and 3rd
Avenue with the injections right one of the biggest issues that we have in that area is the over
congestion the needle exchange programs, homeless shelters and so you add all that and you
compound the illegal drug selling that’s happening here we’re going to have the issues that we
have now which is people are shooting up in our faces. I am supportive of safe injection sites
I’ve been supportive of it from the very beginning. I know that the previous Administration was
supportive of it, and I’ve explained to this Administration that I am supportive of it. There’s
been conversations with the 3rd Avenue BID on identifying locations where we can have a safe
injection site in that immediate area. But I’m just letting you know that I’m supportive and up
to having those conversations. Thank you Madam Chair I’m done with my report.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson asked does anyone have any questions for Councilman
Salamanca? Thank you Councilman Salamanca for your report. Is there anyone here from the
Bronx District Attorney’s Office?
The representative from the Bronx District Attorney’s Office the Honorable Darcel Clark said
hi, good evening. I just wanted to mention that we are currently working on bringing our
annual child safety fair and reentry resource fair as well as soon as I get those flyers I will share
it.
Also, I do want to mention that our DA is currently looking for anyone that is interested in being
apart of a Community Advisory Group for any community concerns and really have an open
floor conversation on what we can do to be of better service. So, if you’re interested, I’m going
to put my information in the chat. If anyone has any questions or concerns, I’m here to answer
them.

Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson asked for the roll to be called.
The roll was called and there was a quorum.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said we’re moving forward, thank you all for coming tonight on
such short notice and working with us and cooperating with us through this very trying time.
So, I’m going start by basically telling you a little bit about the process and everything we went
through to get to tonight.
We, typically worked with the Borough President’s Office to get direction and guidance on what
the process might look like and then we developed a questionnaire so that we would have a
uniform way of scoring the candidates and asking questions that were lawful that had some
structure and complied with the EEOC Office. They gave us clearance that the structural
process by which we were interviewing the candidates, just got clearance on that last week
from the EEOC Commission that it was a good structure process and so we’re in compliance
with the City Agencies.
Having said that when we started the process we basically advertised on various websites and
then the Borough President’s Office said that this is a City Employee Position and that we had
to basically go through the City’s formal website to basically advertise and do recruitment for
that position and we did. Out of the entire process in total we had one hundred resumes that
were submitted and what I did was submit all the candidates to the Executive Committee who
is our Nominating Committee for the Board to do the work. Out of the first batch that we got
we narrowed it down to three candidates and all three of those candidates had experience as
District Manager’s in some way, even had a candidate that was a past District Manager but
because of prior issues in the previous Administration we said let us continue to advertise
and search for some other candidates before we make any decision. Then got a second round
this last round like I reported out in December, the goal was to interview the second round
narrow them down to three and then come back in January after the holidays so that we could
make a recommendation to the Board for consideration. So that we could at tonight’s meetingSPECIAL FULL BOARD
January 19, 2023
Pg. 2
basically vote up or down the recommended candidate to be the District Manager for the
district. Then the goal was to basically start that individual in February because the urgency
here is we have remaining budget dollars a surplus of funds if you remember the last
presentation and if we don’t use those funds by the end of June we lose them. So, we need
those funds to upgrade the office in terms of technology and maybe other things that may be
needed there including the extra monies to basically for bonuses that we approved and may
need to amend. But the dollars are on the table and time is running out so, we need a decision
here because we don’t want to leave the money on the table then lose it. So, then we did that,
and I want to thank everybody here who came to the meeting tonight. You know we’ve had
periodically over the years that I have been here special meetings that we’ve had to call, and I
don’t recall any Boardmember you know complaining that they couldn’t come, if they could
come they came but not what we’re seeing here so I thank you all for doing that. So, tonight is
an honor for me to basically tell you a little bit about the candidate that we’re nominating for
your consideration to be the next District Manager for Bronx Community Board One.
The individual that we’re nominating has 20 years of experience in government, non-profit and
private sector leadership. Born and raised here in the Bronx and he has a passion for
community engagement and services, strategic planning and visioning and his entire
professional career has been dedicated to serving Bronx residents particularly in this district.
He currently serves as the Assistant Vice-President for Community and Economic Development

MINUTES
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said good evening and let us call the meeting to order and
proceed to have a roll call vote.
The roll called and there was a quorum.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said let’s move the agenda, the next item on the agenda is
approval of the agenda. Can I have a motion for approval of the agenda.
Motion made to approve the agenda as presented. Motion duly seconded. Motion called and
passed.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said the next item on the agenda is the approval of the Full
Board Meeting Minutes for the month of November. Can I have a motion for approval of the
Full Board Meeting Minutes.
Motion made to approve the Full Board Meeting Minutes as presented. Motion duly seconded.
Motion called and passed.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said the next item on the agenda is my report to the Board and
the first item that I would like to report out on is the District Manager’s recruitment and to give
a status update on it.
So, we’ve received about 30, 35 more applicants received, and we have acknowledged all
applicants to date. We have met as an Executive Committee and now from this second groupFULL BOARD
December 15, 2022
Pg. 2
will be down to three and will be contacting those three for an interview either next week or in
the first week of January and at that point we will finally be able to make a selection and
recommendation to the Board on a replacement District Manager. At that time what we will do
is we will call an Executive Committee meeting in the month of January and that meeting will
take place in person and for the Board to actually meet the recommended candidate to be the
next District Manager. I will be forwarding you the questions that we asked of the candidate so
that the Board will have the opportunity to ask questions of the proposed candidate and I will
also give you a copy of the new law that was enacted in respect to EEOC and human right
requirements of the new law that was just passed so that when we meet as a Board with the
candidate we know which questions that we need to ask and which ones we should not ask
because it’s a violation of law.
So, we will be getting back to you with the recommended candidate for the new District
Manager and it is anticipated that at that meeting after the Board asks questions of that
candidate will take a vote and it has to be a roll call vote on whether or not the Board approves
of the candidate that is selected by the Executive Committee. Does anybody have any
questions at this time?
Questions and Answers
The next item on the agenda relates to the Board’s Operating Budget and so you got that today
but you will have time to really review it for those of you who need to do so to review the
budget so that you that you have the opportunity to make recommendations on the unused
funds remaining that’s projected remaining with the budget an then by that time the new
District Manager should be on board and will access the needs of the expenditures and take
into consideration for the requests or recommendations on how the unused portion of the
budget should be used. Let me just walk you through very quickly the budget so that
everybody understands what was sent to them today and if there’s any questions after that I
will certainly be able to address them and then we need to have a vote by roll call on this that is
required by OMB. There is also a Board resolution attached that you should have received
requiring us to do this both by formal resolution and it has to be a roll call vote.
So, for starters what you were sent was my analysis and discussion of my statement of
expenditures which is the total budget for the fiscal period of 2022 to 2023. What was actual
spent on a year-to-date basis and what is remaining from the budget. You also have as part of
the excel spreadsheet the percentage for each line-item expenditure of the budget and then
you have a proposed bonus for consideration, and you also have an adjusted column thatshows after a budget proposal is approved how much would be leftover on the line item
expenditures.
FULL BOARD
December 15, 2022
Pg. 3
Then what was done in order to count what would be the unspent portion of the budget
because we don’t have a District Manager calculated and we only have one full-time employee
which would be Ms. Rojas, analyze her expense because we know we’re going to pay that and
anticipated that we would have actually hired a District Manager in the month of February to
start and that would mean February, March. April, May and June five months of expenditures
which gets us to $127 thousand dollars that we’re projecting that we would spend on an
annualized basis. So, when you take the adjusted annualized expense adjusted for the budget
for the bonus minus what we anticipate the salary cost would be that leaves you a difference of
$58,500 dollars left for the Board to consider how to use the remaining budget. Now we have
to use the money, or we lose it so, let me take you through the analysis a little bit further.
So, the budget for the Board’s total Operating Expense totals $337 thousand dollars for the 12
months ending June 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023. The Board’s budgeted operating expenditures
totals $268 thousand of which $237 thousand represents salary expenditures for two full-time
employees, for a District Manager and a Community Coordinator which also includes OTPS
expenditures that your generating general and administrative costs to operate the office and
that amounts to $30 thousand dollars and rent expenditures is a separate line item and that
totals for the year $69 thousand dollars. Now salary costs represents 70.5 percent of the
Board’s total operating expenses, rent costs are 20.5 percent of the costs and the OTPS costs
and that’s general and administrative costs that’s only 9 percent left after those two
expenditures. Now two on an actual day-to-day basis total actual operating expenditures
amount to $42 thousand dollars so far for the year which represents salary costs $35, 924
dollars, and OTPS expenditures amounting to only $6 thousand dollars. On a projected
annualized basis after the proposed bonus is approved by the Board in the amount of $15
thousand dollars it is anticipated that the Board will have approximately operating funds
remaining of $59 thousand dollars. The amount of the estimated remaining funds represents
the unused funds from salary as a result of the District Manager position being vacant.
Attached is a Board resolution for consideration by the Board to approve the budget for the
fiscal year 2022 to 2023 that includes consideration for approval of the bonus for the
Community Coordinator Ms. Ann Rojas and we’re considering her for the budget because she
has had to consume the responsibility for her job in addition to the job of the District Manager.
The remaining $59 thousand with respect to the uses of the fund will be utilized subject to
taking into consideration the Board’s recommendations and the newly hired District Manager
and it is anticipated that the District Manager will be hired by February 2023. So, there will be
no usage of those funds until the Board makes its recommendation, the District Manager is
engaged after being hired and that he or she does an assessment of what the needs are in
order to use those remaining funds and then will come back to the Full Board for approval on
how those funds should be utilized.FULL BOARD
December 15, 2022
Pg. 4
Now what I’m asking everybody to do is to review the Statement of Activities and seriously
thoughtfully email the Board recommendations on the usage of these remaining funds, that
would be very helpful. In addition, you should also be advised that Councilman Rafael
Salamanca awarded Community Board 1 $10 thousand dollars that must be used by the Board
by the end of fiscal year in June 2023. The Councilman’s office will be contacted to receive a
formal notification of the award and I want to thank everybody at tonight’s forum for your
patience and your time. So, at this time I want to open up the forum for any questions that the
Board may have and it will be followed by the voting item.
Questions and Answers
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said does anybody else have any questions or concerns. I want
to stress that if anybody is recommending that in addition to what we’re allocating for Ms.
Rojas make that request and that will be given due consideration as well, nothing is off the
table, but we just want to make sure that we have enough of a surplus and a cushion to meet
the needs of the Board. Is there anymore questions okay, that being said let us now move to
the Board resolution that you have in your packet and we’re now going to do a roll call vote.
So, the resolution that you have is the approval of the 2022, 2023 Board’s Operating Expenses
and a bonus for the Community Coordinator.
In accordance with the requirements of the New York City Office of Management and Budgets
(OMB) Bronx Community Board 1 at a duly held Full Board meeting on Thursday, December 15,
2022 and whereby a quorum was present approves the resolution of the Board’s total
budgeted expenditures in the amount of $336.614 thousand dollars, resolves that the Board
approves on this payout of $15 thousand dollars for the Community Coordinator Ms. Ana Rojas.
Be it further resolved that the usage of the remaining funds is subject to approval by the Full
Board. So, at this point I would like to have a motion from the floor with respect to this
resolution, have it seconded and then let’s proceed to have a roll call vote, is there a motion.
Motion made to approve the resolution of the Board’s total budgeted expenditures of
$336,614 dollars and the $15 thousand dollars for the Community Coordinator Ms. Ana Rojas.
Motion duly seconded.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said at this time let’s have a roll call vote for approval of the
motion as presented.FULL BOARD
December 15, 2022
Pg. 5
A roll call vote was taken.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said so does that complete the roll call vote. So, let me just
finish with the motion, is there anybody that is in opposition, is there anyone who is abstaining.
Annie can you basically tell us how many votes were received.
Ms. Ana Rojas, Community Coordinator responded that there were 24 votes received.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said so, there were 24 yes votes with no oppositions nor
abstentions to the resolution. Let the record reflect that the resolution was passed
unanimously and thank you everyone. Again, if anyone wants to make the recommendation
along those lines please do so. Annie, thank you for everything that you do I greatly appreciate
it.
Another item at the last Board meeting that everybody was concerned about the no-show of all
the Elected Officials and all the challenges that we have, and the ask was that we put together a
letter. I am in the process now I had a consultation at the Executive Committee meeting we
had a consultation to get some direction on what were doing here with respect to the Elected
Officials. So, I’m going to send out a letter to each of the Elected Officials and give them a
calendar of all of our meetings starting in the month of January and ask them personally to
attend the meeting or if not send a representative. So, that they have the calendar of meetings
and then hopefully will be live stream on You Tube or Facebook and it speaks for itself. Them
we’re talking to the Borough President’s Office about all of the issues and the challenges we
face her with respect to safety. As you know you turn on the TV and literally night after night
our portion of the district is just really taking a beating here and conditions are being
exacerbated of what is being sighted here so, I’m going to continue to pursue that until we get
a forum or a meeting with people if not then whatever comes next in respect you know with us
taking next steps you know I’m certainly willing to do that. I’m a resident here too and I’m just
as concerned as everybody here. So, I just wanted to give you an update on that so that you
know that I had not forgotten that request I’ll follow-up on it. To move the agenda there is no
Public Hearing session and the next item on the agenda is the Committee Reports.
Mr. Perez is not here tonight there are no voting items on his agenda, Concord was a voting
item they cancelled at the last minute and then there was a project, a Jericho Project which we
need to as a Board at the next Board meeting follow-up with a formal resolution from the
Board and send a letter to the Elected Officials about the project because the project wasFULL BOARD
December 15, 2023
Pg. 6
represented that they just came in just to let us know what they were doing but the project is
being funded with taxpayer’s and it has an impact on the district. So, I encourage everyone to
read that report.
The next report is the Municipal Services Committee Report and that is a voting item, Carolyn
Chamorro you have the forum.
Ms. Carolyn Chamorro, Chairperson Municipal Services Committee said good evening
everyone so, we had the Fire Department Squad Company 41. At the meeting on the 5th so
they came in because there is so much traffic in the street towards the firehouse they’re
coming to see if the traffic light at the corner of Morris Avenue and East 150th Street and East
149th Street can be in sync to improve traffic flow and if there could be a change in direction of
Courtlandt Avenue, between East 150th Street and East 149th Street where currently Courtlandt
Avenue is northbound. This change would make Courtlandt Avenue southbound for 1 block,
East 150th and East 149th Streets. There’s so much traffic there that there is a delay in response
time in they’re getting to any accident or fires at a reasonable time. So, they made a
presentation on that, and they want us to support their request to change the traffic direction.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson asked what is the recommendation of the Committee regarding
the Fire Department?
Ms. Carolyn Chamorro, Chairperson Municipal Services Committee responded that the
members present recommended approval of the proposal.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson asked so, this is a public safety request to increase the response
time and save people’s lives.
Ms. Carolyn Chamorro, Chairperson Municipal Services Committee responded correct.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson asked is there any questions any the Boardmembers present
have with respect to this request by the Fire Department.
Questions and AnswersFULL BOARD
December 15, 2023
Pg. 7
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said so, here is what I recommend in terms of this matter let us
have the New York City Fire Department and the New York City Department of Transportation
sending them a copy of the Fire Department request to come before the entire Board to discuss
this issue. So, all the issues that we’re having with traffic congestion in our district in particular
that one because I’ve been saying it all along the traffic patterns in this district has caused so
much congestion and has negatively impacted the environment and exacerbated it because
now you have this traffic idling in residential areas and in the commercial district as well.
They’ve reduced all the district lanes that we used to have to be able to easily traverse through
down to one lane to accommodate bikes all throughout the district and it’s causing a lot of
problems especially when you have truck traffic going on and all these cars double parking and
there is no enforcement taking place here. So, at this time what is the motion of the Board
with respect to this voting item do we table it.
Questions and Answers
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said now as a point of clarification and information DOT did
come before the Municipal Services Committee when Hakiem Yahmadi was the Chair of that
Committee, and they presented all the changes that they wanted to do on Third Avenue, and I
was at that meeting and we were fighting like cats and dogs. They represented at the time that
they would be studying the impact of the changes that they were going to make, and they
agreed to comeback to the Board and make changes if what they did was problematic. Now we
have a problem that impacts the emergency responders is what we said all along that this
would impact the emergency responders from the Police Department and the Fire Department,
and we were ignored. So, I agree that we should do everything that we can to help the Fire
Department save lives, but I also agree that we need to send a letter to the Department of
Transportation and to the Fire Department and send the Board’s recommendation subject to
DOT doing an analysis and acceptance of what is being proposed by the Fire Department. I
would recommend that we go ahead and proceed with a vote that we have directions on what
we need to do and then contact the Fire Department and DOT so that we get an analysis and a
complete review by the Department of Transportation to comeback and make corrections to
our concerns with the traffic patterns and the safety and emergency response time. That being
said can we have a motion followed by a vote.
Motion made to table the vote to approve the changes as requested by the Fire Department
and send a letter to DOT, the Fire Department and the Mayor’s Office to come and conduct a
study to accommodate the Fire Department to address the issue of emergency response timeFULL BOARD
December 15, 2022
Pg. 8
and also, to address all of the traffic congestion caused by the changes made by DOT. Motion
duly seconded. A roll call vote was taken.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said let the record reflect that the motion carried unanimously.
So, now the Board has to follow up with a letter to DOT, the Mayor’s Office, the Borough
President’s Office, the Elected Official for the area and the Fire Department to state what the
concerns are and make the request but it should be addressed to DOT because they’re the ones
that made all these changes so, now they have to comeback before the Committee and make
whatever changes hopefully that we’re requesting to alleviate the traffic conditions.
So that being said there’s no more business for tonight’s Full Board meeting and before we call
a motion for adjournment I really wish everybody a beautiful, blessed Christmas and a safe New
Year. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your service to Community Board 1 and I’m
hopeful that the year coming up we can accomplish a lot of things and keep fighting until we
get our voices heard to the issues we have addressed in this community. That being said thanks
everyone and can I have a motion from the floor to adjourn the meeting.
Motion made to adjourn the meeting. Motion duly seconded. Motion called and passed.

Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said we’re starting the Full Board meeting for tonight, November
17* let’s start by a roll call.

The roll was called no quorum.

Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said let me start by giving my report and the first part of the ©
report is the recruitment of the District Manager. The Executive Committee of the Board met,
and we interviewed three excellent candidates from the first pool that we received and from
those three we narrowed it down effectively to one good candidate from that pool. We have
twenty-five other resumes that the Executive Committee needs to consider and narrow down
to three and then one from those three that what we’re then going to be doing is making a
selection from the two so that we can have by January in the beginning of the year a new
District Manager. But we do have one excellent candidate right now.

The budget, I have the codes for the budget, and I need to prepare a resolution to go with that
budget because we have to approve for what we want to use the budget. What | wanted to be
able to do is get some direction from the BP’s Office on how the resolution needs to be worded
so that | get you a draft of the budget together with the resolution for any edits or
recommendations changes that we want to make as a board to the budget. There are two
specific items that we’re looking at doing one we have to approve the salary line items with a
proposed salary bonus line item in there and that will be part of the resolution, the second line
item for this year we will have monies in the budget is to pay someone with technical expertise
to take a look at Board’s IT requirements and work with the Board to setup the proper website
streaming everything IT that we need to have as a Board to comply with the Open Meeting Law
and get it linked to the City’s website. | think that we have enough money in the budget to get
that done so we have to contract somebody paid to do it. So, that concludes my report."

PUBLIC HEARING
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said that the Public Hearing is regarding a rezoning of the former
Our Lady of Pity site, located at 272 East 151st Street. Rezoning Application 210321 ZMX, N
210322 ZRX. What is being considered tonight is a zoning map amendment from R6 to R7A
and a zoning textFULL BOARD

amendment to create an MIH area to facilitate 2 new 9-story buildings with 205 affordable
units.
Ms. Susan Albrecht, Catholic Homes New York said that I have a couple of people with me here
tonight but before we begin, we did ask to see if Fr McGillicuddy of Immaculate Conception
would join us, but I don’t see him on here. As you know Our Lady of Pity closed many years ago
and Immaculate Conception is the local parish.
This is an opportunity for us to reuse this site for good. So, while we’re still working on the
design considerations our objective tonight is to ask for your support for this project which will
provide the highest quality affordable housing and to provide green space, recreational space
for our tenants as well as to create a project that fosters a sense of community. So, again this is
our presentation and again, we’re asking for your support. Catholic Homes New York is the
housing office, owner, Morris 151st Street HDFC, Architects SGVA (WEB), Land Use Attorney,
Goldman Harris, Financial Consultant, Forsyth Street Advisors, General Contractor, Monadnock
Construction and the Management Company to be determined and will be a Request for
Proposals. So, just in terms of who we are our mission driven and again our mission is to
develop safe affordable housing for families, seniors and people with special needs based on
our belief that having a home is a scared human right. We currently have 14 projects that
provide over 29 hundred units of affordable housing for families and seniors. These are 3
recent projects the one on the left is located right next to West Farms 319 units of affordable
housing, the one in the middle is St. Augustas which is located on the site of the former St.
Augustas church and the one on the right is St. DePaul Senior Housing that opened this year
providing 89 units of housing for low-income seniors.
Ms. Nicole Vlado, Architect SVGA said that we are a woman owned Architectural Firm in
Brooklyn. It is a mission of our firm to bring and preserve affordable housing throughout the 5
boroughs and this here shows some images of our recent work in the Bronx, images on the left
are of Borinquen Court, in the middle is Tres Puentes which we have presented to this Board in
the past and just up the road from the project we’re talking about so it’s very dear to us and on
the right is a rendering for a new project in Highbridge which will be under construction next
year. We thank you for your time this evening and look forward to sharing the details Our Lady
of Pity apartments project with you.FULL BOARD

Ms. Susan Albrecht, Catholic Homes New York said thank you Nicole. So, I just want to review
the objectives with you again. The idea is to reuse this vacant site for good and provide much
needed affordable housing as we discussed the rezoning is from an R6 to an R7A to help
facilitate the development of an efficient project. We’re looking at 2-buildings that will be
separated by a large courtyard, the building on 150th Street will be 112 units, the one on 151st
will be 90 units both building will be 9-stories with 202 units of affordable housing, our mission
is to provide the highest quality housing. These are some interior photos of the type of housing
we’ve developed in the past, the two photos on the left are from St. Augustas Terrace, the one
on the right is the recently completed Seconds Farms. Our mission is to provide units for
families with ample space, state-of-the-art security, ample storage and closets, build
apartments and create a welcoming environment that include services that will connect them
to the community again, this is based on our mission as an affordable housing provider.
Mr. Drew Kirizides, Catholic Homes New York said good evening everyone and thank you for
the opportunity to present to you. We’re looking at one of the 9-story buildings on 150th Street
and you see on the right what we mean by affordable housing is low and moderate income 30
to 70 percent AMI. As you know the City’s requirements for formerly homeless families will be
part of this project. We are seeking funding, which is typical for affordable housing that would
be, tax exempt bonds and it comes with another subsidy It will either be from New York City’s
HPD agency or New York State HCR/FHA. The construction cost not the total development cost
the hard cost approximately 70 million for both projects for both buildings combined.
Ms. Susan Albrecht, Catholic Homes New York said that again our mission is to create housing
that supports families and gives them a sense of security. In terms of amenity there is the
lobby, laundry room, package room, tenant meeting room that can be used for community
meetings, a large courtyard that will connect the 2-buildings and security there will be a
Security Guard Station with at least 8-hours in a day and we will be working on that with our
budget and usually in the evening hours.
Mr. Greg Bousa from Monadnock said that the most important thing we do it’s not optional we
require all Sub-Contractors on our projects to make 1 out of every 10 positions on their crew
available to local residents that’s a contract requirement. We then do comprehensive outreach
as we’ve done in the past in Board 1 to all the constituents and try to match up these positions
with people that can take advantage of them with job preparation, we will also fund OSHA
Training for people that don’t have it according to Law 96 which is a requirement of projects
and we will even try to coordinate some specialized skills trades for them too. Again, in theFULL BOARD

past some of the groups we’ve worked with Sustainable South Bronx, Workforce 1, Hire NYC,
United Hispanic Desperado’s, of course Community Board 1 and Elected Officials in terms of
finding and identifying candidates for these positions.
Ms. Nicole Vlado, Architect SVGA said that so the zone that’s outlined in red is actually the
development site describing the location where the two buildings will be. Again, just to the
east of Morris Avenue on East 150th and East 151st Streets. We’d like to go to the next slide
which just describes in a little more detail the buildings, these two 9-story buildings with a
shared yard between the two, I think that’s one of special amenities of this project which will
include a series of spaces for both small and large groups of all ages. This shared yard will
provide not only a beautiful view from within the buildings but will also serve as a communal
for the tenants, it will help promote the health of the tenants and the surrounding
neighborhood by encouraging the activity and now the two buildings themselves have this
shared view of the yard. The north building on the left on East 151st Street has light colored
brick in the front and a darker brick in the setback and rear whereas the south building has the
darker brick in the front of the façade and lighter brick in the setback and we intentionally used
these contrasting brick colors to minimize the appearance of the bulk of these buildings and we
also do this by integrating some vertical bricks at the front to really make the buildings read
smaller than they are and in addition we intentionally stepped the buildings to become smaller.
In our effort to design buildings with for health and wellbeing both the buildings are strong
candidates for rooftop solar and the client has expressed a strong interest in an all-electric
approach to the buildings heating and cooling systems. The area is known for having a very
eclectic mix of building types and heights and we find that our buildings of 9-stories are related
to many of the buildings in the adjacent areas.
Mr. Eric Vath, Goldman Harris said that I’m joined by the Managing Partner of Goldman Harris
and we just going to say a quick word about the proposed actions. Chair Parks mentioned this
is a ULURP and before you tonight you’re considering a map change R6 to an R7A and if you
look at the Zoning Map on the left you have the existing zoning, you’ll note that the existing R6
is shown in an orangey red color and on the right is the proposed R7A zoning district which
includes the development site and some lots along Morris Avenue. I’ll note that the
commercial overlays the C1-4 is within 100 ft. of Morris Avenue and that stays the same and
the R7A puts us in line with the surrounding district, there’s an R7-1 to the north, an R7-2 to the
west and a C4-4 which is an R7-2 equivalent. The second action before you tonight, is a Text
Amendment for Mandatory Inclusionary Housing Area. So, thank you for your consideration.FULL BOARD
December 16, 2021
Pg. 5
Ms. Susan Albrecht, Catholic Homes New York said that so, just a little bit more on about
Catholic Homes what makes us different from other developers and providers is that we are
uniquely linked to Catholic Charities Community Service and we have recently expanded the
programming we’re beginning to introduce on-site Social Services in all our housing for all of
our tenants and this is something that we’re funding that we really believe is critical for helping
our tenants to be successful to avoid eviction, connect residents with educational job
opportunities. We do food distribution events at different sites and we did recently a vaccine
clinic in the community room at one of our sites. So, these are different programs that we’re
involved in. Again, currently we just started this program this year, currently operating
programs in Manhattan, Bronx. We actually Catholic Homes has, on-site services at Betances
and at Second Farms and beginning this program in Highbridge. That’s just a little bit of an
overview.
Mr. Drew Kirizides, Catholic Homes said that these slides, shows initially the AMI range, 40 to
70 percent AMI, an earlier slide at 30 percent AMI that would be what was required formerly
homeless the rent is set at that rate 30 percent, but for the general population it’s 40 to 70
percent AMI. What you see below is a range of rents from 40 to 70 it’s studios, one-bedrooms,
two-bedrooms and three-bedrooms which this project has.
Ms. Susan Albrecht, Catholic Homes said that so, we’ve done extensive outreach to the
residents of the Bronx specifically in this community through Community Board, community
groups, local parishes encouraging people to apply, and we have found that has worked well
some of our other housing and then a lot of times it is people that move into these buildings
and really like to encourage that to keep a sense of community. Then finally, as we mentioned
we’re looking at the different financing options in HPD and HCR regardless any publicly funded
housing there is some component for the homeless at least 30 percent and at least we will have
15 percent. Again, this is the range, and we haven’t finalized the numbers yet we’re working on
it, but it really depends on the financing how that will run the room sizes and distribution will
be. Then there’s the timeline so, we officially certified our application the first, we’re here
tonight to get your recommendation and then go to the Borough President, so that the
Borough President will be able to achieve this before the end of the year. It goes immediately
to him, but it might be the next Borough President, goes to City Planning, the City Council and
then we look to start late next year probably early 2023 with a 26-month construction period,
occupancy in 2025. That concludes our formal presentation, I know that there have been
questions that appear in the Chat so, I think I’ll have to close out this to be able to look at those.
We really hope that you will vote in favor of our proposal, if there are any conditions or
concerns will be happy to address them.FULL BOARD
December 16, 2021
Pg. 6
Questions and Answers
Mr. Ted Weinstein, Director of Bronx Planning for HPD said that the question about
community preference the process is computerized it’s all on the computer so, what happens
first the computer pushes forward those applications where people have said that they meet
the categories for the set asides to the 2percent and the 5 percent those area addressed first
once that is addressed then the Community District preference. The computer then pushes
forward people who have applied in Community District 1 and that continues until 50 percent
of the available units have been allocated, then the computer opens it up to everybody else.
So, it’s straight forward in the process but it is true because each building gets thousands of
applications there are many people who are just never contacted because the numbers never
get to them.
The Zoning Resolution for the City includes provisions as to what the requirements would be to
provide on-site parking it varies depending on the zone and what type of housing is being built
then as a ration as a percentage it says how many spaces there are likely to be. The situation
was such that we were finding, City Planning was finding that some of the buildings where it
was built with parking, whether it was surface parking or underground garage parking they just
were not being utilized to make it worthwhile. Every time that you do provide parking it’s a use
of scarce resources not just the money but the specs itself and so, the proposal was to try to
change that so that the buildings being built that were, I’ll use the phrase lower income and in
transit zones subways for example then there would not be a need to provide parking. The
buildings that have somewhat more middle income then the ratios might still apply. That was
the required ULURP for the Community Board, the Borough President, Planning Commission
and City Council. So, the buildings that have somewhat moderate-income units then the ratios
might still apply. That was the required ULURP approval of Community Boards, the Borough
President and the City Council. So, each building that gets proposed now must take a look at
that resolution and see how they would qualify and what might have to be done. I know that
Mr. Torres in previous meetings has asked and I have spoken to the City Planning Department
to see if they would come up and provide with whatever numbers or studies they have.
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson said that so for the record in the Bronx the Community Board
voted no and the Elected representatives voted against their constituents and voted not to
have parking so that more housing could be built so, that’s how we got here. That, being said
does any other Boardmember have any questions, issues or concerns related to this project.
At, this time we’re going to allow the Chair of the Economic Development-Land Use & Housing
Committee Freddy Perez, Jr. to give his report and recommendations to the Board and thank
you everyone for your questions.FULL BOARD
December 16, 2021
Pg. 7
Mr. Freddy Perez, Jr. Chairperson Economic Development-Land Use & Housing Committee
said thank you Madam Chair. The presentation you just heard the same presentation that was
made on the first at the Economic Development-Land Use & Housing meeting, present there
were 10 Committee members including myself. The concerns by the Committee were as
follows:
1. The construction of a two 9-story building without parking for the incoming tenants.
2. The height of the buildings being constructed 9-stories each which would create
shadows and eliminate sunlight for the current homeowners.
3. The oversaturation of the area, the fact that more people would be moving in
approximately 200 new units of 100 percent affordable housing with a set aside of
15 percent homeless.
4. The impact of the construction on Alfred E. Smith High School and the first
responder’s EMS, Police and Fire on East 150th and 151st Streets that are extremely
very narrow streets.
5. The impact and the over saturation of more people moving in would create a burden
on Lincoln Hospital and School availability.
6. Concerns about public safety, transportation and the environmental impact on the
community because of the construction of such a la4ge project.
After I pooled every member for any other questions that they had, I requested a motion on
the former Lady of Pity Zoning Map Amendment from R6 to R7A to facilitate the two new 9-
story residential buildings on East 150 and 151st Streets. The Committee members voted as
follows 9-no votes, and 1-yes vote. Therefore, Madam Chair and members of the Board the
Economic Development-Land Use & Housing Committee recommends not to approve support
for the Zoning Map Amendment presented. This concludes my report and I yield back to you
Madam Chair.
Arline Parks, Chairperson said thank you for your report and recommendation to the Full
Board. Based on the Chairs recommendation to the Board we will now take a roll call vote on
the matter of the rezoning for this project. So, can we have a motion for this project, and a
second.
Motion made to accept the recommendation of the Chair of the Economic Development-Land
Use & Housing Committee to not support the project due to the number of reasons stated.
Motion duly seconded. A roll call vote was taken with 22-no for support of the project and 1-FULL BOARD

In the month of October, we had five shootings, it is two less than last year, we are lowering the
numbers in shootings. We are under mandate for the vaccine, we don’t know necessarily what
the final numbers will be, but we do have 18 new Officers to the 40"" Precinct, so in manpower
they will be making up more than we have lost with the heavy influx of retirement and
whatever the outcome of the mandate for the vaccine is. In front of the Precinct, we have a
Halloween for kids tomorrow at 3 PM it’s an annual event we’re going to have some
performances and candies for the kids so, if you guys could put that out, that would be great.

and required updates so we’re in the process of doing that. So, we’re ordering new hardware,
new computers and a new copy machine so that you will no longer receive individual sheets for
submissions from the office that will just allow us to operate compatibly with new technology
and no longer receive single sheets. We also had a meeting Annie Rojas and | with Waste
Management regarding air pollution complaints that we were receiving from Port Morris and
certain parts of Mott Haven.

We met with principals of Waste Management who informed us that they were having
problems as a result of the COVID and, also problems related to the hurricane that passed
through. That there were freight trains that delivered the garbage just sitting standing still and
causing air pollution and air quality issues. What they pledged to do was to address it and to
keep the doors properly closed and sanitized. There were also issues relative to what they
were doing around water resiliency, rebuilding the bulkheads so that if there is another
significant storm the community would not have to worry about waste traveling into different
parts of the district. They pledged that when they were ready to rebuild the bulkheads they
would come before Community Board 1 so that there will be proper involvement with the
community in the design of the waterfront and what the bulkheads should look like.

This is on the Agenda for consideration tonight and I really thank all the Board members for the
survey that was distributed and really, helpful as a preliminary start in terms of us submitting a
proper Statement of Needs and Community Priorities that gives, good consideration to really
addressing our needs for the district. The item is on the Agenda and we asked for an extension
so that we could do a really good job within the timeframe to submit a really, good Statement
of Needs and Community Priorities in the district and it is due by November 12*, and we will go
over it in the meeting.

Finally, I’ve asked Tom Lucania to reach out to the New York State Power Authority and
NYSERDA to come and make a presentation before Community Board 1 around new
transmission lines that they want to bring from Upstate New York and Canada down into Mott
Haven. Kathy Hochol during Climate Week made an announcement that there was an RFP that
was issued and the award to implement the transmission lines was awarded to Clean Path
which is a joint venture between Inver Energy, and the Power Authority and the contract was
awarded to Hudson Power otherwise known as Chippie and a joint venture between Blackstone
and Hydro. We’re in the process of asking the State Authorities to come before this Board and
give us all, of the information and particulars around the project. The representation that
we’ve seen so far is that this initiative will create approximately 10 thousand jobs statewide and
bring 8.2 billion dollars in economic development investments including Developer committed
investments to support disadvantaged communities. There are discussions going on but we

Community Board 1 needs to be involved so that we can be part of the discussions and to
understand how this project will impact our district. That being said the next item on the
Agenda is the Public Hearing on the Statement of Community District Needs and Community
Board Budget Requests and it’s a voting item. Based on the survey items we received the first
priority is Housing the second priority is Health and Education, and the third priority is public
safety and quality of life. So those are the three priorities we’re working on. That, being said
we’re opening up the session at this time.

The Public Hearing was opened and the Boardmembers reviewed, discussed, and voted on
each item of the Statement of Community District Needs and Community Board Budget
Requests with 2-abstentions Tracking Code 101202214C, 1-abstention Tracking Code
101202215C, and 1-opposition Tracking Code 101202217C.

The Chairperson Ms. Arline Parks called for a motion on the Statement of Community District
Needs and Community Board Budget Requests.

Motion made to approve the FY2023 Statement of Community District Needs and Community
Board Budget Requests for the district. Motion duly seconded. Motion called and passed to
approve the Statement of Community District Needs and Community Board Budget Requests.

Public Hearing closed.

Councilmember Honorable Rafael Salamanca said that first | want to congratulate you madam
Chair on your election and | also want to congratulate the First Vice Chair and the Second Vice
Chair, so congratulations.

| want to get straight to it in terms of capital dollars we passed the budget back in June and as
you were talking about capital dollars | pulled up the list of this budget that took effect July 1% |
allocated 800 thousand dollars to public schools just in Community Board 1. We allocated 300
thousand dollars to MS29 for chrome books and technology, | was able to allocate 150
thousand dollars for technology upgrades at PS1, we allocated 50 thousand dollars IS5 for
chrome books, IS157 we allocated another 50 thousand dollars for chrome books and PS 17 |
was able to allocate 250 thousand dollars. It’s important that you’re going through this exercise
as you know | was a former District Manager so in the Council | review the Expense and Capital
Budget of the Community Board give because | know the value and effort they put into it not
many of my colleagues understand that but | do and | ask that you continue doing that and if
there’s a project that’s realistic and you think that | could put it into the next upcoming budget

FULL BOARD
October 28, 2021
Pg.5

please reach out to me and ll be more than happy help you out with the budget. You know in
the Council we do street co-naming and we’re going to vote on a batch sometime in December
and | just want to inform you that | put in a street co-naming for Georgie Rodriguez at the
corner of Melrose Avenue and 149"" Street. So once | get the green light on it in December |
will inform the Community Board so that we can plan an event in the Spring and invite his
family and have a big event.

Then very quickly some quick information I’m beginning to plan turkey drives. I’m planning a
big drive in Melrose Houses and | use the Classic Center because they have the space, we’re
planning on giving close to 500 turkeys at that event. Once | get that going, | will make sure
that the Community Board has a flyer so that you can spread the word. Finally, just two things
really exciting at least for me at the last City Council Hearing | sponsored a bill that would
require the Department of Environmental Protection to create Borough Commissioner positions
in all five boroughs. So Parks Department has a Borough Commissioner Iris Rodriguez, DOT we
have Nirvado Lopez right, he’s the Borough Commissioner, Buildings Department has a Borough
Commissioner, but DEP doesn’t have Borough Commissioner’s and we’ve seen what's
happened lately with the infrastructure the flooding we need to hold someone accountable and
| know Effie’s great, and does a great job but you know what if Effie’s doing all that work then
they should make Effie a Borough Commissioner or they need to create Borough Commissioner
positions, | will keep you informed of that. Finally, my last thing it’s a bill that got passed called
the Death Certificate Bill. Many of you know | lost my dad as have thousand of family members
in New York and that’s from COVID in April 2020. When I got my Dad’s Death Certificate it said
that he died of natural causes and | didn’t think nothing of it neither did my friends or family
members. Back in the summer the Federal Government allocated funds to FEMA for individuals
that had a family member that passed because of COVID there was funding to try to help out
and pay some of the funeral expenses and so my friends and family that lost family members
were trying to apply the Death Certificate did not say that their family member passed from
COVID. So, to revise a Death Certificate you have to apply to the City of New York, and you
have to pay a 40 dollar fee on top of the 15 dollars that they’re mandated by the state, my bill
waived the 40 dollar fee.

The Chairperson Ms. Arline Parks said that | would like to make a very important
announcement that because I’m the Chair of Community Board 1 that have decided on the next
Chair of the Economic Development-Land Use & Housing Committee. This individual has been
on the Board for a decade serving on the committee and I’m honored to announce tonight that
the new Chair of the Economic Development-Land Use & Housing Committee is Freddy Perez,
Jr. He has served admirably during his tenure on the Board and his attendance on the Board
and his commitment to the Land Use Committee has just been fantastic. So, in that regard Mr.
Perez you are now the Chair of the Economic Development-Land Use & Housing Committee and

FULL BOARD
October 28, 2021
Pg.6

as always | am here to work with you to ensure that we continue to do the good work that it
does for the district and for Community Board 1.

Mr. Freddy Perez, Jr. said I’m honored to accept the position of the committee and | fully
understand the role. Rest assured that I will use every means necessary to Chair the committee
along with my colleagues to the best of my ability with complete transparency and integrity.
Thank you for naming me to that position.

The Chairperson Ms. Arline Parks said that so, tonight will be my last report that | give for the
Economic Development-Land Use & Housing Committee. We had three presenter’s and all
were voting items.

The first presentation that was made and this is a voting item and it relates to something called
the Open Restaurant Text Amendment. We had Justin Lamorella, Senior Planner for the
Department of City Planning make a presentation around the Restaurant Text Amendment they
needed support from the Board and we also had Nirvado Lopez whose the Bronx Borough
Commissioner for the Department of Transportation. Again, this is the Open Restaurant Text
Amendment.

In summary in response to the issue of COVID and restaurants being able to open sidewalk
cafe’s including restaurants in streets. The City Council voted to make it permanent and the
particulars around the Text Amendment is to develop plans to codify design guidelines for
allowing the permanency of restaurants and street cafes. One of the components is to
consolidate control and accountability to the Department of Transportation. They want to
change the zoning regulation to allow for permanent street cafes. The other provision is that
by shifting the responsibility over to DOT, DOT will make the decision as to whom gets a license.
They will receive and review the applications for consideration based on guidelines that they
are now in the process of establishing. DOT is also stating that they will setup a special unit for
enforcement, they will also develop specific design guidelines that will include 8-foot clean
paths for sidewalks, 12-foot clear paths for commercial corridors and they will also allow setups
in parking lanes except for prohibited zones like hydrants, bus stops and in No Standing areas.
They are saying that they will do enforcement on sound and ensure of ADA requirements. This
is the first step in the process and DOT will return to discuss the initial proposal drafted for
what roadways and sidewalk cafes would look like in the district. They will be working with the
City Council to enact permanent legislation and laws governing sidewalk cafes and roadway
cafes. They are also on an ongoing basis asking community residents to visit the DOT website
and submit comments.

FULL BOARD
October 28, 2021
Pg.7

Now the committee after the presentation voted no to this Amendment and here’s the
rationale why the committee voted no. The concern over DOT’s enforcement and issues with
DOT now, no parking, traffic congestion being caused right now by DOT changes and DOT is not
working with the community right now around the issues that we have. The issue of DOT’s
oversight of it and that there’s also it appears to be not a clear process for community review
and input as it relates to the permanency and selection of the sites. The other thing that is an
issue for the committee was the fact that DOB no longer has oversight over these structures
that are being built and it’s now being transferred to DOT. So those were the concerns and let
me just reiterate what are the Board’s concerns the removable of existing zoning regulations
and just doing that without understanding what is there, what’s being removed and ensuring
safety for the public. The removable or seemingly of a mechanism in place for the community
to basically have meaningful input into the siting and placing of these cafes. The other one is
the concern around having DOT doing a structure review and not having some linkage with the
Department of Buildings. There are significant quality of life and environmental concerns that
exist in this district and we didn’t see how they would really address it since they’re not
addressing the issues that we have now. That being said are there any questions from the
Board about this particular matter that we should consider before we cast the vote.

Questions and Answers

Motion made not to approve a letter of support to the Department of City Planning’s Open
Restaurant Text Amendment. Motion duly seconded. Motion called and passed not to approve
a letter of support to the Department of City Planning’s Open Restaurant Amendment with 24-
No, 2-Abstentions and 2-Oppositions.

The Chairperson said that the next presenter was the Catholic Homes New York, and it was a
request for approval for a rezoning and they were looking for a letter of support to change the
zoning for a development project that’s located at 276 East 152"" Street. They want to change
the zoning from an R6 to an R7 to increase the height of the building that they want to develop,
and they want to develop 200 units. This is not a voting item at this time because they didn’t
have enough information for the Board to grant a letter of support so, they are going to appear
back before the committee with all the information so that we can give them good
consideration on the project.

The last item as it relates to the committee report was a Mr. Frank St. Jacques from Akerman
LLP and he came before the committee to ask the Board to give a letter of support so that he
can renew his application to operate Planet Fitness that’s located at 2914 Third Avenue and the
renewal of their permit is for ten years. On this particular item the committee voted
unanimously grant a letter of support so that Planet Fitness can continue to operate.

operation for next ten years. Motion duly seconded. Motion called and passed unanimously.

Mr. Hakiem Yahmadi the Chairperson of the Municipal Services Committee said that | had
Westside Federation for Seniors and Supportive Housing located at 570 East 137* Street. That
was the parking lot that was part of Millbrook and now senior housing. Their asking for three
spots for the ambulance to pickup their patients. | didn’t have a quorum but in the
conversation that day Ms. Byrne’s had suggested instead of seven days they could have five
days from 7AM to 7PM, so that the community would still have some type of parking from 7PM
until the next morning and the weekends. A day later they came back and asked for seven
days. When they first brought it to our attention, they were saying that they needed to take
patients to the hospital and to their Doctors from Monday to Friday and the other two days for
when they want to go out. | had a meeting with the Tenant Association President, she was okay
with the five days. She has residents behind the senior building that have walkers their ramp
where they would go to the curb for Access-A-Ride and things like that was taken from them.
So, when | brought back the seven days, she said no that she doesn’t agree with that. They’re
coming back next month.

The next thing was the Jackson Avenue Bike Boulevard that they want to put from
Westchester Avenue and Jackson Avenue all the way down to 138rh Street and reconfigure the
streets one-way in certain areas and going down and vice-a-versa. DOT when they first met
with us in June, we had said that they host a Town Hall in the community because you have
homeowners, resident buildings, shelters, and schools and all of them will be impacted and
you’re talking about 150 parking spots that will be lost to the bike lanes. Supposedly and if Jose
is still here from Diana Ayala’s office, they held a Town Hall and only four people came and the
four people said no. They had a second one where the Tenant Association President and four
other people were on and voted no. But just this past Saturday | saw on the news that DOT is
going ahead with the Bike Lanes. So, I’m asking for a resolution to send a letter to the
Commissioner of DOT to stop that process until we get a new Mayor and until they come back
to the community because they said that they were going to come back but they never came
back.

Motion made to send a letter to the Commissioner of DOT, Elected Officials including the
Mayor’s Office opposing the installation of the Jackson Avenue Bike Boulevard with the
concerns of the community. Motion duly seconded. Motion called and passed unanimously.

The representative for the Honorable Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz, Jr. said that first
of all | want to congratulate you on this evening’s meeting it really went smoothly our technical
problems from last month seemed to have disappeared and | appreciate all of the work that
you did this evening and a very productive first meeting for you. | just want to thank those new
Boardmembers that attended the orientation. We are continuing and | think | may have sent
the final one today sent the presentations to the new Boardmembers which they heard that
evening from the various agencies | also sent it to the Board and to the Chair so if you feel that
you want to forward it to the Full Board it’s probably a good opportunity review some of the
basics like conflict of interest regarding City Planning Commission and all of the resources so,
there big files so | sent them separately so that your mailboxes didn’t get bombarded. If the
Chair feels that it’s something to share with the Board that’s probably a good opportunity for
people to catch up with some of the works of the agencies. | will continue to work with you
Madam Chair and with Annie who’s done a yeoman’s job in keeping the place running. | will
follow up on some of the items we spoke of this evening and we will set all those meetings that
you would like us to schedule.

Questions and Answers

The representative for the Honorable State Senator Luis Sepulveda said that | have a couple of
notes here that | would like to share with everybody. So, due to an exhaustion of funds the
Department of Labor will no longer be accepting applications for the Excluded Workers Fund.
To date most of the DOL applications most of which were determined eligible. The Senator
along with his Democratic colleagues are circulating a letter to request additional funds to be
allocated for this critical program to those who were largely excluded for any Pandemic
assistance, and as of today | believed it worked because someone who was not eligible before
just had money from the DOL, so that is good news. | believe that now it will be extended to
those who were excluded before for example those who might not have a social security
number but ITIN from the IRS, they might be eligible now. Also, I’m happy to announce that the
Workforce Diversification Project is a compilation of current job openings, trainings, classes,
and internship opportunities, and more that our office becomes aware of. We have worked
hard to create this project to help transition the Bronx from unemployed to employed. Each
month our office will be sharing an updated link with constituents through email or by
accessing the Senators website. Listings for the month of October can be found at
nysenate.gov/senator/-r-sepulveda. Our district office is open now by appointment only, and if
anyone wants to schedule an appointment, they can please call 718-991-3161.

The representative for the Honorable Councilwoman Diana Ayala said | do want to announce
that the Councilwoman is in the process of developing a Workforce Development Taskforce for
Council District 8 and we are in the process of convening a meeting with a Jobs First
organization to tackle the issue of workforce development specifically to target our youth and
young adults to train and properly advocate on their behalf. We’re working with various
Community Based organizations that specialize in workforce development to strategize and
develop best practices on how we develop workforce development programs throughout the
district so, that we can properly target our young adults and youth to train them for the
workforce, and example of that would be if an area hospital wanted a phlebotomist to train
them in phlebotomy but at the same time to ensure that the said medical institution has jobs
available for those individuals that their training has been completed. So, this is an example of
the type of programming that we’d like to develop out of this Taskforce and once that has been
developed, we will provide that information to you all. In addition to that we’re in process of
organizing and planning our turkey distributions throughout the district and once that’s
finalized, we will forward that information to the Community Board. Lastly, | just want to state
for the record that the Councilmember while she understands the need for Bike Lanes as
connecters to green spaces and an alternative mode to transportation, she does not agree with
the way in which the Department of Transportation handled the situation with the Jackson
Avenue Bike Boulevard Proposal. As she stated many times before the elimination of 150
parking spaces obviously is of great concern to everyone in the community and also a great
concern to her. As she stated it is completely unacceptable especially when the Department of
Transportation couldn’t come up with an alternative to try to save those said eliminated spaces
as a result of this plan. Obviously, the community deserves an alternative plan as you had
stated before earlier in the meeting, we all support the need for alternative modes of
transportation, but we like to do in conjunction with the involved community so that we can
have a constructive and proper dialogue where these connectors should be, and this wasn’t
done, and this will further exacerbate the congestion throughout the community. It was totally
irresponsible by the Department of Transportation in the way that they have moved forward
with this proposal and the Councilmember has expressed this to the Commissioner himself. In
addition, this week she had a conversation with the Mayor where she expressed her frustration
and concern with this particular proposal. While | don’t have any good news as to the reversal
of the Boulevard Proposal, but the Mayor did indicate to the Councilmember is that while he
does support the Bike Lanes and his proposal because it is a Mayoral initiative, he does agree
that these types of proposals are not for every community. We should look at the community
as a whole and see where these Bike Boulevards should be allocated, or you know
implemented within a community obviously that wasn’t done here as it was rushed. He did
promise that he will have the Commissioner come back to us and discuss the issue and to see
what can be done as an alternative plan. | reached out to the Administration prior to the day

terms of the Jackson Avenue Proposal at this point and time.

The representative for the Honorable Bronx District Attorney Darcel Clark said | just wanted to

COMMITTEE REPORTS

Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson of the Economic Development-Land Use & Housing Committee
said that there were three presentations made and one was a voting item. The first item that was
presented Sheldon Lobel PC who appeared before the committee and asked for a letter of support for a
project at 180 East 132nd Street to be rezoned from M1-5 to RA& for them to instead of building three
buildings they could build two and increase the heights and to set the buildings back so that it wouldn’t
be so close to the bridge. So, they basically want to raise the height to 15 floors and that way they
wouldn’t have to do three buildings there. So, they made their presentation, and the committee did its
due diligence and asked a lot of questions to the Attorney because the actual owner of the property was
not present and too many of the questions that we asked in regards, to their project regarding benefits,
community issues like affordability. They informed us that this would be market rate rent and they also
informed us that there would be no community access along the waterfront. Then there were issues of
mitigation for flooding there. It was just too many issues that they could not respond to and for those
reasons the committee members that were presented voted not to give them a letter of support. We’re
presenting this to the Full Board to ask for a vote in regards, to the project.

Motion made not to give Sheldon Lobel PC a letter of support on their project at 180 East 132™
Street. A roll call vote was taken with 21-No, 3-Abstentions and 0-Yes. Vote passed not to
provide Sheldon Lobel PC with a letter of support.

Ms. Arline Parks thanked the Board Members for their votes and said that there were two
other projects presented one was the LaGree Baptist Church whom, just came into the
community and purchased a building on 161° Street. They just came as a point of information
to let the Board know that they’re here, and of all the projects that they’re bringing into the
district.

The second item which was very important was HPD and they made a presentation around
their intent to put out an RFP on the lot at 351 Powers Avenue.

Ms. Brenda Goodwin, Chairperson Health-Human Services & Seniors said that the committee
met on September 14"" and the presenter was Mr. Luis Laboy, Addiction Services and
Community Engagement Emma L. Bowen. He came before the committee because his
Organization wants to rent a location 2776-2778 Third Avenue. It’s historically a substance
abuse program and is currently vacant. They want to rent that space for a medication

assistance treatment facility but not providing Methadone, as well as with the following
services of mental health, vocational and alternatives to incarceration. They do not receive
funding from the city, state or federal government they charge clients for their services and
licensed by OASIS.

| explained to him that on numerous occasions we have spoken about substance abuse facilities
coming into the district and particularly in that area that is so overwhelmed with what’s going
on. I described for him that from St. Ann’s and 145"" down to 149"" Street we are inundated
with the drugs that’s going on in there now with the crack and marijuana. There are also a
couple of schools in the area on Third Avenue. So, I told him that these facilities have not been
favorable in the past and that we’d have to vote for support for a program like this to come in
again. So, there were 4 of us at the meeting we did take a vote for the program and since there
were 2-No and 2-Yes, I told him that his request for a letter of support would have to be voted
on by the Board. So, that’s why I’m bringing it before the Full Board, because the Board has
always told the Health Committee that they're tired of these programs coming into the district.
At some point and time, | would hope that we would do a moratorium on this.

Motion made not to provide the Emma L. Bowen with a letter of support on their proposed
rental of 2776-2778 for a proposed outpatient treatment service. A roll call vote was taken
with 20-No and 3-Abstention. Vote passed not to provide Emma L. Bowen with a letter of
support for their rental of 2776-2778 as an outpatient treatment facility.

The Chairperson Ms. Arline Parks said that the last committee is Municipal Services, and it is a
voting item and it’s regarding Patterson Housing and they’re requesting a letter of support for
the renaming of 143 Street and Third Avenue to be renamed Nathaniel “Tiny” Archibald Way.

Tiny Archibald was an NBA professional basketball player who was born and raised in the
Patterson Housing Projects and he used to sponsor basketball clinics, drug and violence
prevention programs throughout his career.

He was the oldest of 7 children and at the age of 14 became head of the household when Big
Tiny left the family. He learned all about rising from desperate surroundings it was an
education that started early in life through a 14-year playing career from the Cincinnati Royals
to an NBA championship with the Boston Celtics. Nate Archibald was a man who did not forget
his roots and continued to be a presence in his community every summer he returned to the
South Bronx to help counsel troubled youngsters. When he stopped playing basketball, he
returned to New York City to run a Basketball School for under privileged kids and to work as an
Athletic Director at the Harlem Armory Homeless Shelter until it close in 1991. So, at this time
what we want to do is put a motion on the floor.

vaccination vans were placed on 138"" Street on Brook Avenue.

As we all know the Councilwomen is Chair of the Consumer Affairs and Business Licensing she’s
also Chair of Mental Health, Disabilities and Addictions, the Aging Oversight investigation
committee. Throughout the summer we participated and coordinated with our NYCHA
Development and their tenant leadership for several bookbag giveaways, we held several
movie nights, also helmet giveaways at St. Mary’s and Sawmill Park. One of the things that |
want to touch upon is that this Monday the Councilwoman as the Chair of the Bronx Council
Delegation convened a meeting with the Bronx Council Delegation Cabinet Members with the
New York City Police Department Commissioner Dermot Shay his Executive Staff to talk about
and see how in partnership wit the New York City Police Department how, can we address the
issue of a rash in gun violence throughout the Bronx. As we all know there’s been an increase
in gun violence and unfortunately there has been unintended consequences as a result of some
of the reform laws which were necessary but however there are some unintended results chief
among them has been a proliferation of drug abuse and also an increase in gun violence. Just 2
weeks ago while | was at our Bronx office shots were fired across the street where | had to rush
and bring several constituents into our office and a week prior to that incident there was a
shooting that resulted in a homicide. It’s been rampant throughout the borough in Member
Gibson’s district, Councilmember Riley’s district and Councilmember Salamanca’s district where
actually his office experience a shooting from a block away where a bullet entered his office
while his staff was in operation there, thank goodness no one was hurt. But that is why we
convened the meeting with the Police Department to talk about ways in which we can work
together, we can sort of make amendments to certain laws while keeping the reforms there but
also strengthening them. Lastly, | just want to let you know that our office has is open and
we're here to serve you Monday through Friday from 9-5.

The Chairperson Ms. Arline Parks asked Mr. Jose Rodriguez from Honorable Councilmember
Diana Ayala’s office to give an update on DOT’S proposed Jackson Avenue Bike Boulevard

Full Board
September 30, 2021
Pg.6

project and to give information to the Boardmembers present regarding the work that has been
done around that issue.

Mr. Jose Rodriguez said that first | want to thank you and Hakiem for bringing this to my
attention and working with you all concerning the Jackson Avenue corridor and pressing upon
the Department of Transportation to really look at that corridor and to understand that, that
particular corridor as it is may not be the appropriate area for what they’re trying to
accomplish. | will say this as far as from the Councilmember while we respect and agree to
some extent the city’s efforts in creating transportation alternatives, however that particular
corridor is problematic for what the city wants to do. It’s congested as it stands now and the
Councilmember feels that should this proposal be implemented it would further exacerbate the
congestion on Jackson Avenue regardless of what the Department of Transportation has
presented to us and what they say that this will alleviate some of the congestion while
providing bicycle access along that corridor, and not to mention the loss of about 150 parking
spaces which are desperately needed in this community, this is unacceptable and this is her
official position. We reached out to the administration this week and we haven’t heard from
them as of yet, but rest assured that we will not let this down and you know | spoke to the
Councilmember today to say that | just want to make sure that we’re all in alignment.

What | just responded to you all is exactly her statement and we hope that the Department of
Transportation the Commissioner’s Office not the Borough Commissioner addresses this
particular issue because they had a Zoom meeting, but we wanted an in-person. We
understand that we’re still in COVID and there are some issues health wise, however with this
type of proposal and given when it was announced we could have done some type of in-person
so that the community could have an understanding about what’s happening. They did a
virtual meeting and not too many people showed up, we also coordinated a meeting on our
own a few more individuals attended that meeting chief among them was the Moore Houses
Association and residents of the Moore Houses. | do believe that we were not given the proper
notice that this, particular proposal was coming into the Jackson Avenue corridor. There are
several schools there that will affect the pickup and drop off. There have been many questions
that the Councilmember requested of DOT that we have yet to hear a response from and we’ve
reached out to the administration and want the Commissioner’s Office to respond. | personally
myself reached out to their Intergovernmental Unit and let them know that the Councilwomen
is not in favor of this proposal, so this is where she stands.

The Chairperson Ms. Arline Parks said that I’ve gone down that street and if they close it down
there are actually homeowners who wouldn’t be able to turn in their block to get to their,

houses. What | saw there today was that DOT was out there to proceed with the project, so it
would be helpful if the Councilwoman could send some form of formal request asking them to
not to move the project further until there is proper consideration as to what can be worked
out in regards, to an appropriate bike lane in the district. That said at the next Board Meeting
perhaps what we can do is have a vote by the Board to issue a formal resolution from the Board

in regards, to this matter and cc all the Elected Officials for district, DOT and the Mayor’s Office
to help Diana fight for us in this particular matter.

Motion made to accept the Elected Officials reports as presented. Motion duly seconded.

Public Hearing

ROTHKRUG ROTHKRUG & SPECTOR, LLP

Mr. Adam W. Rothkrug, Esq. said that 624 Morris B, LLC seeks a zoning map amendment from R7-1
to R7-1/C1-4 to legalize commercial use for this segment of Morris Avenue and permit site modifications
to the ground floor of 624 Morris Avenue.

The proposed project area consists of seven contiguous lots within a single block 1, 4,5, 6,7, 8, and 9. It
is located on the eastside of Morris Avenue, north of East 151* Street in the Melrose neighborhood.
This includes 175 feet of frontage along Morris Avenue 80 ft, a wide street and 70 ft. frontage along the
north side of East 151° Street. It is currently zoned R7-1 as noted above.

The Development site consists of Lot 4 which is an interior lot with approximately 1,207 sq. ft. in lot
area. The parcel contains approximately 17.25 ft. in frontage and 70 ft. in depth. The parcel is improved
with a four-story and cellar 3,657 sq. ft. mixed use building (3.03 FAR). The building occupies the front
52 ft. portion of the lot with an 18 ft. rear yard. The ground floor contains approximately 660 sq. ft.
restaurant and the remaining floors are residential with three dwelling units one per floor.

The commercial use on the ground floor dates from at least 1973 when a small store was present, which
was connected to a shopkeeper’s living quarters in the rear of the store. In 1999 the space was
converted into a restaurant, extending the commercial use into what was once living quarters on the


Full Board
July 14, 2021
Pg. 2

floor. The work was performed without an alteration permit from the Department of buildings and a
violation was recorded against the property, so the commercial use is currently nonconforming.

The proposed actions are not intended to facilitate new development. Instead, the nonconforming
commercial use occupying the ground floor of the development site, the restaurant would become a
conforming use. The existing restaurant space would undergo renovations and the restaurant would
remain. There would be no increase in floor area, no horizontal or vertical enlargement of the building,
and no ground disturbance. The proposed zoning map amendment would map a C1-4 overlay over the
project area but would not change the underlying R7-1 district.

The proposed action would result in the restoration of a commercial overlay along Morris Avenue, a pre-
existing mixed-use corridor with commercial uses present for decades. The proposed action would
legalize pre-existing commercial uses along the eastside of Morris Avenue between East 151° Street and
153"" Street, and overall reducing the degree of nonconformance with zoning in this area. The project
area is located on a wide roadway and is in close proximity to transit, making the proposed action
appropriate for this area.

Questions and Answers

The Board Members present were in unanimous support of the project.

NEW YORK CITY DEPARTMENT OF CULTURAL AFFAIRS

Ms. Kayla Coleman, Deputy Director Percent for Art said that | just want to take some time to
introduce Jeffrey Gibson who was the artist selected for the 40 Precinct community project, and he will
be showing you his proposal tonight. But nothing has been created as of, yet this is just a conceptual
design and we're coming here first to share this with you. We will be going to the Public Design
Commission for an upcoming meeting to review and approve this design. There will be time for
question and answer about the artwork after Jeffrey has presented. After the discussion we would like
for the Board to take a vote on the project and then follow up that vote with a letter of documentation.
We will include that letter with a package we will be sending to the Public Design Commission. We look
forward to keeping the community informed on this project as it moves ahead. | would now like to turn
it over to Jeffrey who will show you his conceptual design.

Mr. Jeffrey Gibson, Artist said that I’m going to share a presentation with you, so this is for the
community room at the 40"" Precinct. | will be creating three site-specific paintings and a permanent
installation in the Community Center at the 40"" Precinct. The title of the overall installation is Life Could
Be A Dream, a lyric from the 1954 song “Sh-Boom” by the Chords. The first canvas will be Life could be a
dream, second is Life could be a dream and the third is Do-roo-do-do, sh-boom.

Additionally, the three paintings will be inset into a mural painted directly on the wall that frame the
three canvases into one immersive installation. The paintings will be protected by glare free tempered
museum glass and the mural will be coated in a clear non-yellowing surface that can be wiped down for
easy maintenance.

The layout of the three paintings takes into consideration the use of wall space as mural, the proposal
consists of three 60” x 60 acrylic on canvas paintings. Here are images of recent paintings which should
serve as reference to the overall look and feel of the proposed paintings. The mural will be hand
painted directly on the wall with interior latex paint.

The way | put things together is like a collage a quilt, things are layered up on top there’s different types
of textures and surfaces, lots of color and lots of pattern. This is the process we've done in the Brooklyn
Museum that installation you saw with the moccasins and the Roberta Flack lyrics on top, this is a side
view so you can see

it’s directly to the wall so we’re not taking any additional space. The paintings will come out and the
mural will be developed around where there’s an ATM. The lighting will be over the top so that there
won’t be a lot of shadows there, it will be very evenly lit and really brighten up the space.

Questions and Answers

There is to be a Public Hearing on the WIN POWERS (346 POWERS AVENUE) Project (Voting
Item)

Public Hearing

Ms. Winifred Campbell HPD Deputy Director of Bronx Planning said that HPD is proposing the
following actions on the project WIN Power project (1) the designation of an Urban Development Action
Area (“UDAP”); (2) Disposition of City owned land; and (3) A special permit pursuant to Section 74-903
of the New York City Zoning Resolution (“ZR”) to modify the requirements of ZR section 24-111 to allow
an increase in permitted floor area ratio FAR for Use Group 3 non-profit use with sleeping
accommodations from 2.43 FAR to 4.8 FAR.

Ms. Christine Quinn, President & CEO said that the development site is located in the Mott Haven
neighborhood and occupies most of a block bounded by East 142"" Street to the north, East 141 Street
to the south, Jackson Avenue to the east and Powers Avenue to the west. The development site is
currently occupied by a three-story building and a parking lot near the corner of Jackson Avenue and
East 141° Street. The existing building and parking lot will be demolished to allow the site to be
redeveloped with the proposed development

Ms. Christine Chisholm said that the existing WIN transitional shelter for families on the development
site will be replaced with the proposed development. There will be 2 new buildings, building 1 is the
proposed 11-story family shelter building and building 2 is an 8-story for supportive housing. There
would be a total of 221 units including 153 supportive units and 68 for families with children, plus two
superintendent units, and a daycare facility.

In building 2 the cellar will primarily contain offices for building and social service staff for to provide on-
site-supportive services such as case management, clinical mental and behavioral health services, a


FULL BOARD
June 24, 2021
Pg. 3

child-family liaison providing individual therapeutic interventions and family counseling; and job
development counseling. The ground floor will have a mix of one, two- and three-bedroom units, as
well as a community room and computer lab, while the upper floors will be populated with a similar mix
of supportive units and the 7"" floor will include two laundry rooms. Also, there will be a daycare center
on the ground floor. Included will be approximately 28 bicycle parking spaces, 8 in Building 1 and 20 in
building 2.

In the center of the development site, landscaped open passive and active recreational space will be
provided for each of the buildings. The space would include a playground and play area; seating areas
with picnic tables; as well as other passive seating areas. Also provided will be trees; plantings; and
other landscaping throughout the space. The utilization of open space between buildings 1 and 2 will be
separate from each other. Overall, the proposed development will have 281, 790 square feet. of the
floor area (4.71 FAR), a lot coverage of 70 percent on corner lot portions and 58 percent and 60 percent
on interior lot portions of the development site and provide minimum 60 ft. rear yard equivalents on
through lot portions of the site.

Ms. Christine Quinn said that this will be a purpose built shelter the building that were in now was
never meant to house families in the way that it is and so in rebuilding it what were able to have is
larger units to better fit different family sizes. To have the community room benefit the residents will
have childcare for the residents living on site as well as 24-hour security. Additionally, we do have a lot
of outdoor space as well as a playground specific to the children and families that are living in this
facility. WIN anticipates starting construction on Phase 1 shortly after the completion of the ULURP
process. It is anticipated that construction will begin on Phase 2 in early 2024 along with the demolition
of the existing building and construction of the permanent housing. Phase 2 once the transitional
housing is built and occupied the existing building will be demolished and that is where this new building
would be constructed. The affordable and supportive building again would be 223 permanent units. So
that’s permanent housing for persons who were formerly homeless as well as 88 affordable units for the
community. In the permanent housing building we’re really looking to improve the streetscape. These
buildings will be done in an energy efficient way to include solar panels. As mentioned, we have social
services in this building, and we will have a community daycare center with its own area. Two things
that | want to mention as well we do look to do community hiring as much as possible but we also setup
our Tenant Advisory Board so that’s an opportunity for us from WIN as a service provider to meet

regularly with members of the community to address any issues as they come up and make sure that we
have an open dialogue, so that we can do as much as we can to be the best neighbor possible.

So, this is the slide that shows the amount of outdoor space, the dark purple area as you can see is the
transitional housing where will have the playground there for the children that are living at that shelter,
the yellow darken area is the courtyard for the permanent and supportive housing also you'll see the
daycare. There will be development of a fair amount of outdoor space in this project. So, this is both
buildings once they are complete and this building is existing and not related to the project which is dark
grey here. Similarly, these are renderings from a different project just to give a sense of where the
design is currently heading.

June 24, 2021

The last thing |’ll share is the timeline, so here we are in terms of Community Board review here as you'll
see there are several other steps, and should we go forward we’d be looking at the first phase beginning
sometime in 2022 and the second phase of the project sometime in 2024.

Questions and Answers

Ms. Arline Parks Chairperson Economic Development-Land Use & Housing Committee said that
this project just came before the Board in 2019 and at that time the committee members were opposed
to the project and there were issues that still are issues with the fact that the Community Board nor the
community ever received the particulars about this project in advance of it being certified by the City
Planning Commission. The community was not afforded the ability to respond in fact we haven’t seen
any studies on the project to understand the impact of these buildings being torn down nor have we
seen anything regarding mitigation. We also discussed the fact that at the location that they’re talking
about the building that would be impacted is a Diego Beekman building which is 324 Powers Avenue.
We are in the process of doing major improvements at that location and there are structural problems
at this location which we are not trying to deal with. We also discussed the fact that this is the Diego
Beekman community that consist of 38 buildings, 1,200 units of housing and it also is a homeowner
community which has the Nemiah Homes that are impacted as well as Jackson and Concord Avenues.
We also discussed the number of already existing shelters and supportive housing that are already in
this community that have some impact on the quality of life and other issues that we have in this
community. The biggest issue here is that the Community Board has not been notified about this
project at all prior to the two times they came for presentations before this Board and there’s just a lot
of issues that we have around this project that we weren’t afforded the opportunity to discuss in
advance of certification by the City Planning Commission. We also discussed the fact that coming to the
Board now after the fact talking about an Advisory Board when people are opposed to the project is an
issue and | don’t know that people will want to join an Advisory Board on a project that they don’t want
in the first place.

Then there were some other issues to take into consideration environmental impact just a whole host of
things and for all of those reasons the committee voted not to grant a letter of support for this project
moving forward. We discussed the location of it, we discussed that fact that this taken into
consideration all of the supportive housing we have on 138"" Street, the supportive housing we have on
139"" Street, the supportive housing shelters we have on 140"" Street, the brand new and the fact that
the location of this requires all this traffic to go into down along Cypress Avenue to the 141* Street
corridor which will cause problems for the Diego Beekman community and none of that was discussed in
advance of the project. We tried to in 2019 to make the outreach to HPD this project was done as a
result of planning and hard work that the community did to talk to Elected Officials who were very
supportive of what we were trying to accomplish to bring the type of project to the community that
would address some of the social development issues and quality of life issues in the community that all
to often fall on the Diego Beekman community because of how it’s ‘situated and the access we have
since 1974. So that being said | got to say that we've had there Senator Serrano’s on the phone and he


FULL BOARD
June 24, 2021
Pg.5

can attest to this that it had been a shelter that had been a problem in the community prior to WIN. We
were hoping to be afforded the opportunity to develop that site to create community space other things
that the Diego Beekman community doesn’t have and that we sorely in need of, but we were not
afforded the opportunity. We put together a plan to be afforded that opportunity and the manner in
which the project is being disposed of so for all those reasons we’re making the recommendation at this
time for the Full Board not to support this project. | am now requesting for a motion and a vote from the
Community Board in regard to this project.

Questions and Answers

The Board Members present were opposed to the project and the community that the project is
sited in also does not support the project and as such no letter of support will be granted from
Community Board 1..

Public Hearing Closed

Honorable State Senator Serrano said that | was hoping that Mr. Loftin was here tonight so that |
could publicly thank him for his service, I’ve known him since | was 17 years old and I’m 47 so you can do
the math. He did an amazing job and we’re very grateful for him.

| just wanted to come by tonight to talk a little bit about the work that went on during the legislative
session which just concluded recently. One of the main issues that we dealt with was with COVID Relief,
many of our small businesses, arts and cultural organizations small housing, renters you name it have
suffered disproportionately within our community during the COVID Pandemic, this has created a much
harder strain in our community. | think was highlighted by many of the disparities the community faces,
whether it be healthcare disparities or economic disparity. So, | believe that the COVID Relief package
that was part of recent federal stimulus was directed to the communities that needed it the most. So,
I’m very happy that my colleagues in government both in the Assembly and the Senate were able to
those with food insecurities and real relief to our arts and cultural organizations. We suffered a great
deal during the Pandemic so, I’m happy that we were able to do that. So, we passed a much more
progressive taxation policy within the State of New York insuring that the wealthiest in our State pay
their fair share of taxes so that we can pay for the programs, educational opportunities and for things
we need as a community. So, I’m grateful again to my colleagues and all the people in the community
who pushed very hard for aggressive taxation. Also, we were able to pass some legislation to deal with
gun violence and gun control measures. With the unfortunate of gun violence within our community it’s
something that | know many members of the community have shown these concerns and have come to


FULL BOARD
June 24, 2021

me. Again, I’m very grateful to the community for being a strong advocate through the Pandemic,
staying in touch with my office, staying in touch with my colleagues, and super grateful to everyone for
giving me the opportunity to come by. Jose Ramon as always, my representative here on the Board and
very grateful for his steadfast support within our office and he’s always available if you need us and you
know | can be reached at 212-828-5829. | will put my information in the chat and thank you for having
me.

The representative from the office of the honorable State Senator Sepulveda said that | do have
some announcements for gun violence awareness month the Senator did award $50 thousand dollars to
three programs to address the effects of gun violence. Asa reminder there are important housing
updates the Emergency Rental Assistance program which provides 12 months of rental assistance
regardless of immigration status and you can visit the website, | will post it in the chat. The eviction
moratorium was extended to August 31%. | will end with as a reminder our office is now open, to assist
constituents on an appointment basis and | will put our address and the phone number in the chat box.

The representative from office of the honorable Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz, Jr. said
thank you for your work this evening and thank you for your service during these last 12 months as we
head to a rest period. It has been a challenge for everyone | think that going back to in-person meetings
will be helpful to all of us. | hope that you take the summer to relax and stay healthy so that in
September we can come back strong. | just want to thank Annie who has done a yeoman job over the
last month since Cedric’s retirement to keep the place running. You will get information over the
summer about opening the office and things of that nature. Thank you for the Chairperson’s taking on
some additional. responsibilities and will continue to do so for the next couple of months and for the
hard work they have done over this past month. To all those members who were reappointed
congratulations, and we will be appointing new members in the next week or so leadership will have an
opportunity to meet with those over the summer so that they’re ready to go in the fall. Over the
summer | am available for questions, you can talk to Annie and she can send them to me. You have my
email address from my mailings to you, if you have any questions over the summer please feel free to
let me know and again, we will provide you with some updates over the summer as to what is going on
at the Board over the summer. Thank you all again and have a restful and safe summer.

The representative from the office of the honorable Councilwoman Ayala’s said that the
Councilwoman would like to thank everybody for the hard work they've been doing it’s been a difficult
year but we’re pulling through. We wanted to say that our office has been open for a long time Monday
through Friday at 214 St. Ann’s Avenue. We have been helping our constituents with the ERAP
application, we have been making appointments because it’s a long application we’re open to help
everybody who needs assistance with that. Some of the events that we have been doing in the
community is movie nights we have a movie night tomorrow we had to suspend the last movie night at
Sawmill Playground because it had started to rain, but the kids were excited so we’re going to be able to

FULL BOARD MEETING
February 25, 2021
MINUTES

The Chairperson Ms. Betty Bryant-Brown commenced the meeting with a prayer.

Ms. Lavender Ross Crisis Counselor from New York Project Hope North side said that
Northside was founded by Dr. Kenneth and Mamie Clarke and they are famous for this thing called the
Black/White Doll study. What that did was that it was crucial in ending legal segregation I’m going to
give you the simplified version what they did was show kids a white doll a black doll and the black kids
would say the white dolls were beautiful, the white dolls are smarter just better in every way. That study
helped end segregation and they took they’re Doctorate and Psychology training and opened up Northside
Center in Harlem it’s been going for 75 years, actually it’s the 75"" Anniversary this year.

Iam a Crisis Counselor with Project Hope which is basically a statewide crisis counseling response
organization and we’re basically trying to help your constituents understand their emotions during this
time. Helping to provide resources during this time we’re lacking so many we reach out to schools and
after schools and try to assist those especially the children and the families struggling with remote
learning. Then we realized that there is so much more that we can offer and there are so many other areas
of people that need assistance. So we’re reaching out to all the Community Boards and trying to figure
out what it is you guys need and how we can help. So we start by offering various resources for housing,
food banks, financial planning, childcare, health needs, education and so many other things that we plan
to offer to the people in your community. So we’re here today to present this and see what you guys need
and understand that everything we offer is free and confidential. We’re seeking to partner with you all
that way you can help to promote the services that we offer. We also offer a hotline for anyone in need
no matter if you need someone to speak to or find a local resource whatever it is, we’re not limiting our
resources to anyone. We’re aiming to accomplish this within your community and we’re hoping that we
can partner with you if there’s anything that you feel that you need that the community doesn’t already
have.

DISTRICT MANAGER

Pg. 2

Motion made to approve the agenda as presented. Motion duly seconded. Motion called and passed.

The District Manager Cedric L. Loftin said that this follow up item toa presentation at the
Economic Development-Land Use & Housing Committee meeting of this past month. There’s a
presentation coming to us related to a ULURP item that has to be dispensed with this evening. The firm
engaged in city policy, which is HPD, does HPD have personnel here to discuss the item as part of the
presentation.

Ms. Kay Real HPD said that we’re here to present to you the newest scattered site development project
which spans Community Boards 1, 2 and 3 which we’re referring to as the Melrose Open Door Cluster.
The project is made up of 12 scattered development sites which total approximately 70 cooperative
homeownership units and in Community Board | there’s are 28 units. The project was a winning
proposal in 2014 that invited applicants to submit proposals for clusters that would otherwise be too small
and too difficult to develop on their own. So this is a ULURP Application and the actions that you will
be voting on tonight are the application of the site as an Urban Development Area and disposition of city
owned land. In addition we’re also proposing an amendment to the Mott Haven North Urban Renewal
Plan. The Mott Haven North Urban Renewal Plan was created in 1994 and included in the cluster are
Urban Renewal sites 675 Eagle Avenue and 672 St. Ann’s Avenue. The floor area and the ratios are not
consistent with the current zoning requirement and the parking requirements in the plan are prohibitively
restrictive. So adhering to these plans would prohibit construction on these sites so that’s why were
amending the plan to accept these plans from their restrictive requirements. So after years of only being
able to develop low income housing which we’re still committing to doing. We’re very excited about this
project to expand homeownership and to provide opportunities to residents with moderate income. So I’Il
turn it over to MAHANY that will provide more details.

Ms. Ismene Speliotis Executive Director MAHANY Management said that HPD selected
MAHANY Management as the developer of these homeownerships in Community Boards 1, 2 and 3.
We’ve come twice before the Economic Development-Land Use & Housing Committee last year before
COVID and then last week with updated information. MAHANY owns and manages many units of
housing in Mott Haven and those units are 100 percent affordable to extremely low and low income
families, so we’re excited to bring this homeownership opportunity to the neighborhood.

Mr. Matthew Feis Architect said that we’re been working with MAHANY over the last couple of
years and with HPD to design new construction homes for homeownership. We’ve been looking at all 12
sites together as a cluster. Predominately about our firm we’ve been working in the affordable sector for
years we have a long history and practice of dedicating ourselves to affordable homes throughout New
York City you can see here in Community District 1 there are 4 sites in total. So the first site we’re
looking at 627 St. Ann’s Avenue and all of these sites are vacant so there is no existing building and
because of the nature of this project it is difficult to build between two existing buildings on a lot so we’re
dealt with the difficulty of building where there is nothing on a very narrow site. This allows us to
basically be held to 4-stories and we’ve tried to be very cautious to make sure that what we do design to
mix not only with the adjacent buildings but surrounding area. Almost all the sites similarly carry the
same characteristics it’s basically a vacant lot of historical context. Here we see 675 Eagle Avenue this is

Pg. 3

a narrower site they vary from 18 ft. to 25 ft. wide here we see this is only 4-apartments in total one
apartment per floor, 672 Cauldwell Avenue again we’re sandwiched between two buildings the
constraints are 4-stories and only allows us to put 8-apartments. Here we’re looking at 840-842 Tinton
Avenue this is a corner site and having as much openness at the site not encroaching on anything around.
Something that you may have seen throughout the project we will be having an energy efficient heating
system all the appliances will be stainless steel and modern each apartment will have its own
washer/dryer hookup and what we’re looking at all the buildings on the first floor will be ADA
accessible, all the apartments on the other floors will be ADA adaptable there will be no elevator only
stairs. In the basements we will have bicycle storage and paved roofs in the front yard we’re trying to
have trash containers where applicable. By the nature of the project being a coop the utilities and
electricity would be the obligation of the homeowner.

Ms. Ismene Speliotis said that when we thought about these sites we thought to build a feasible like 3-
family with rental cooperative ownership and settled on cooperative ownership for a couple of reasons,
we’re actually able to generate 70 homeownership and so we thought for affordability and a number of
owners in the neighborhood we thought that this was a better way to go so that is what you are seeing 16-
and what we decided to do. We are extremely focused on affordability and long term affordability so the
concept that we introduced and spent some time with the committee on that we’re actually engaging in
you know during the time of construction and development hopefully if the project goes forward. We
would really like to engage with the Community Board members and the community at large around the
reality and concept of the Land Trusts they’ve been around forever but have taken some traction W
there’s a kind of a balance on affordability and equity and a return on their investment and how that
works doing it is a longer conversation that we can’t get into tonight but I’m making a firm commitment
to do this with you hopefully if you’re interested. So we’re looking at cooperative homeownership over
the long term placing it on the Community Land Trust we’ve been ensured that the unit is affordable for
subsequent homeowners. So they’ll be a sale and a number with the equity on it to be affordable to the
next purchaser. There’s a lot of information on this slide and we’ve tried to actually respond to many of
the questions last year in 2020 and then last week. So this is actually showing you across the whole
project all 12 buildings of 70 units. We are absolutely going to have time for questions and answers so
people know we’re available to you as long as you want us tonight.

So basically there are 13-studios, 26-one-bedroom, 15-two-bedrooms, 13-three bedrooms, and 4-four-
bedrooms in this 70 unit complex. Last year one of the concerns had been on the sizes of the units and
the Architect went back we don’t have last year’s numbers but I can tell you all the apartments increased
in size. The Architect took up all of the area that they could in order to make the units as large as they
could as large as HPD would allow us so I think they did a good job. The units range because they’re
between two buildings and so they have limitations not just by the zoning of that particular lot but what
can happen when you’ re building something sandwiched between two properties. As I said MAHANY
has developed and owns several properties 100’s of units are the lower income level so we’re excited to
bring in this mix and units of housing that would be available to moderate income households and the
ranges of sales prices are due to the fact that some units are smaller than others. Not only in the studios
are there different sizes but in the 4-bedroom, so you can see here that the prices range for each type of
apartment. What we’ve done for you here is actually told you the range of income that would be needed
and be able to purchase a coop apartment in the sales price range that we’re showing you. Then the big
question that the people asked at the meeting last week so one question is, how much does it cost up front,
second question is what does it cost every month what do I need to have available. So these again are

Pg. 4

ranges and what we’ve done here instead of inundating you with numbers on the chart we actually tell
you what’s included. So basically in a coop there are certain costs that are covered by the coop
underlying mortgage, HPD is putting money into this project the state is putting some money in but there
will be a mortgage. The coop will have a mortgage along with each individual homeowner so this
number reflects the portion of the coop mortgage you will be paying there are no real estate taxes because
there will be an abatement. There’s water and sewer bills there’s gas and there will be the public hall and
exterior light electric shared among the cooperative shareholders. There is insurance for the property
separate from the homeowner insurance which is also included in here but there’s two types of insurance
and then you’ll be doing an audit so you'll have accounting costs. You have the maintenance person
cleaning up the building for you and there’s certain filings so this number in red is monthly carrying
charge for a homeowner that would own a studio, or one, two, three or four bedrooms. There is also the
AMI so we’ve taken the income required to purchase where they fall within the New York City Median
income. Then just another piece of information we gave you is how much money do I have to have saved
in order to purchase and again that’s a range with a 30 year bank mortgage with as little as 5 percent
down you could put more. A lot of people even at these income levels don’t have savings New York City
is expensive so the bank has programs so this will give you a sense of what the down payment would be
and what’s another benefit is that New York City has a House Assistance Program. All of the units that
are below 80 percent of Area Median Income which means there are two-bedrooms, one-bedrooms and
studios and families that are eligible for those units are also eligible for HPD’s First Time Homeowner
Down Payment Program which is up to $40 thousand dollars in closing costs. The units above 80 percent
those are federal funds that pass through the city so that’s an added bonus for some lower income
perspective homeowners. That’s a lot you guys can decide which slides you want to keep up for
questions.

Mr. Matthew Feis said that we’re doing as much as we can to move the project forward basically with
the sale of the homes in 2023. You can see construction takes nearly two and a half years and I can’t
speak for Ismene but there will always be seminars, ongoing workshops, and discussions throughout the
project.

Ms. Ismene Speliotis said that MAHANY has been approved for homeowner counseling and so we
will begin immediately during construction running seminars, we run seminars now and we’ll really focus
the Community Boards where the homes are coming up to make sure people are ready for this
homeownership opportunity and can avail themselves of it.

Questions and Answers

Mr. Nestor Rojas resident said I’m here to stop this particular project on our street. Given that it’s
just going to be a sore eye not going to be helpful to anyone.

Ms. Arline Parks Chairperson Economic Development-Land Use & Housing said that
concludes my report to the Board that we approve this application subject to the parcel at 675 Eagle
Avenue with these condition that MAHANY has to continue to work with the homeowner to find some
solution to the blocking of his windows to mitigate it and that’s what we approved.

Pg.5

Motion made for Board to approve the application subject to the parcel at 672 Eagle Avenue that there
be some continuing dialogue with MAHANY and the owner there to try to work something out. Motion
duly seconded. The roll was called with 13-Yes with condition and 6-No. Item passed with condition.

Public Hearing Closed

The representative from the Honorable Bronx Borough President’ Office Ruben Diaz, Jr.
said good evening Board Members and residents of Board 1, first of all thank you all for your continued
work through these virtual meetings I know it’s not the best way to conduct meetings especially not to
have these meetings for such important topics. But I do appreciate all the good work you have done over
the 10 months we’ve had to endure this meeting setting. Just a couple of quick items I do want to share
with all of you is we shared our last Borough President Newsletter with you which has the most updated
information on COVID vaccination locations and a host of other items over the last couple of weeks
including a laptop given to students that contacted our office those who are in need of laptops. We had a
philanthropist donate a couple of hundred laptops which we were able to distribute to young people in all
grade levels to have laptops of their own to continue their education. If you go to our website under
education there is a form there who for any child that does not have a laptop or chrome book can fill that
out when additional laptops become available, we will be able to distribute to those children.
Reappointment applications for Board Members were due on February the 5"", [ know again with COVID
and mail and being able to find a Notary it sometimes has been difficult but if you have not submitted
your application and you’re up for reappointment I ask you send the application in even if it’s not
notarized so that we do know that you’re interested in returning and we can begin the process with the
Council Members. Finally, all of you should have received through your personal email the cycle 3
Sexual Harassment Training Course which you are required to take as Community Board Members.
Please be careful that the email that came is probably an email that is not familiar to you so don’t ignore
it, it’s from DCAS and it has your link and it has your password for the course. Once you’ve taken the
course you will then receive a certificate two to three days after you’ve completed the course, once
you’ve got that please forward it to me or Cedric as long as it gets to me at some point. Once again on
behalf of the Borough President thank you for your commitment to Community Board 1.

Questions and Answers

Honorable State Senator Luis Sepulveda said that first of all I hope everyone’s safe and healthy
and taking care of themselves. The COVID rate for our county is still the highest in the city we are 5.70
percent so I’m still telling everyone to please continue wearing face masks. During the COVID crisis my
office alone has given out over 45 thousand masks and we have many more to give out so if you or
anyone you know needs masks please reach out to us our information is in the chat. One of the things
that we have been working diligently on the last few weeks is getting people vaccinated we’ve created our
own wait list we are working with many providers throughout the Bronx to get people appointments.

Pg. 6

Anybody that needs help please sign in on our wait list vaccination sheet you’ll see it on the chat. On the
people that have signed up we have a 90 percent success rate. I know earlier when we started the meeting
Someone was asking about signing up for the vaccine, I believe that this is one of the best ways we’ve
done about 175 people and this week we anticipate doing 200 people. So my staff has done a fantastic
job to make sure that people get vaccinated we’re a resource here to help. At the Senate level we passed
series of bills that will impact Nursing Homes on the reporting of deaths. What we did is we passed a
packet of legislation that will have a direct care ratio for Nursing Homes. Many of you might not know
but most Nursing Homes are for profit now and theyre not spending enough in terms of patient care and
keeping most of the profits. We’re going to create a taskforce mandate a disclosure of Nursing Home
rates, they are rated and if they have a terrible rating people should know that. We’re going to require
more infection policies by Nursing Homes for state officials to conduct more thorough inspections. This
is about accountability we cannot let those deaths that happened in Nursing Homes. We also passed a
series of Utility Legislation that will hold utilities accountable for restoring service to insure, that utilities
do not pass on the cost of legislative lobbying. They have lobbies like many organizations and entities
but it’s not fair that they pass the cost of lobbyists to the consumer we got to put an end to that practice.
That’s also going to clarify the medical equipment that is essential with electric service. These are some
Qof the bills that we’re pushing through we’re going to have Consumer Advocate within the Service
Commission to look out for our interest vis-a-vie utilities. I’m proud to announce I had two of my bills
passed the Senate this week one is legislation that is going to direct the Department of Civil Service to
make efforts to hold examinations for State Civil Service positions on the campuses of SUNY educational
opportunity centers. Now these opportunity centers usually are up north not down south. Down south we
know that most of our student’s come from communities of color so they will not be given the same
information, availability for them to apply for Civil Service jobs and start a career. We also passed a
that’s going to prevent double bunking in state correctional facilities with the advent of COVID and
what’s happening at correctional facilities passing away from COVID we want to make sure that we make
things as safe as possible. Our office is closed but we’re working through phones, email and text and we
have done 700 unemployment claims to help people with because my staff has learned how to streamline
the process anyone who has difficulty give us a call and we’ll help. We’re also making sure that people
are not illegally evicted, I do the evictions myself or assist, if anyone feels they’re getting evicted let us
know because the landlord is supposed to send you a hardship form. If you’ve suffered hardship because
of COVID they cannot evict you because of that. Landlords that own 10 or less units in a building can
get foreclosure protection you can keep your property. So please use us as a resource we’re here to help
the community.

Questions and Answers

The representative for Honorable State Senator Jose M. Serrano said that so we’re also always
available to help you can reach out to us at 212-828-5829. We also continue helping people with housing
issues, unemployment, evictions so you can always reach out to us.

The representative from Honorable Assemblywoman Chantel Jackson said that one of the
things I want to highlight the Assemblywoman has been distributing PPE’s and also partnering up with
Bronx County to give food giveaways and we’re looking to do more in the future, so if anyone needs
please put in a request. I know that the Senator highlighted on what most of the Elected Officials are
working on but one big thing that she passed was the Clean Air and Water bill which will guarantee
everyone access to clean air and water. Also some of the things we’re working on we’re still working

Pg.7

remotely we’re still providing some of the help with our constituents. So if anyone has any issues
regarding unemployment, we’re partnering up with our local organizations so that we’re taking care of
our constituents. I will provide my information and team information if anyone needs help.

The Honorable Assemblywoman Amanda Septimo said that I’m sure that people say it all the
time but I mean it this is always my favorite Community Board to come because you guys take the work
so seriously and it really is refreshing how intricate and how deep you dig into everything, so thank you
for the work that you do. Senator Sepulveda took a lot of things I was going to say but that was a lovely
report. So the two biggest things that I want to highlight we’re in our second month but we’re doing as
much as we can so that we’re doing as many PPE giveaways and sign up for vaccination and information
giveaway because we known that there is a lot of genuine concern which we understand and we want and
try to dispel any misconceptions and clear up any questions and help anybody with any information we
can with regards current virus vaccine. Secondly hopefully you all are getting calls from our office in
these couple of days to emphasize that our office is open to help with anything especially the hardship
form as it relates to evictions. If any landlord wants to evict, they have to present the tenant with the
hardship form and so we want to make sure that people know that they’re protected in that respect and we
help people to fill out the form. I’m here to help as is my office and thank you all for everything you do.

Questions and Answers

The representative from the Honorable Councilman Rafacl Salamanca said that tomorrow
we’re going to have a mobile van outside our office doing rapid COVID testing. Monday we’re going to
have a food giveaway from our office at 9 AM in the morning. We are still working remotely so we will
have constituent services by appointment only.

The representative for Honorable Councilwoman Diana Ayala said that our office is open a
constituent services and the telephone and email is in the chat.

The representative for Honorable Congressman Richie Torres said that we’ve had a long hectic
month and we’re just getting operations together with the Congressman’s team. We are doing in person
by appointment only in particular circumstances and we’re right here on Lafayette Avgenue. So it’s been
a lot of piece work that we’re getting and we’re also trying to have an ear on the ground. I’m ina 10
block radius of most of you so whether we cover everything on this call or not you can always reach out
to me I'll put my info in the chat. The three biggest things we’ve been working on have been a lot of
immigrations, people here might of heard of the man from Honduras he was detained by ICE later and
then taken again by ICE officials. Cases like that we go back and forth and there’s a whole mess of
misinformation and people from the Trump Administration fighting to deport as many people as they
could. If you know of anyone whose been detained with or without any information on their rights please
reach out to us. That’s something that we’re pushing for everyday and it’s our biggest thing by far
especially with a large population of African migrants and a growing population of Asians. People don’t
usually think of them in the Bronx you know it’s not only English and Spanish of course we have a lot of
Spanish speakers too the Dominican Republic so that’s one thing. Another thing we work on a lot of Post
Office issues and we’ve already heard a lot of those. It’s a federal agency not as glamorous as the other

Pg. 8

big groups if you know of any packages that are missing or especially what we’ve been seeing a practice
called bleaching you get a money order and pay for it but then you get a letter of notification because it’s
been used to purchase something without your consent. That’s a big case of fraud and some of the offices
especially in our district give excuses they don’t want to chase around to find out where the money has
gone. Reach out to us whether missing package or missing money order. The third thing is tax policy as
part of the Federal Relief Package the income levels and the amount you get on your taxes back was
increased $2,000 thousand dollars for children under 16 for $3,200 for children under 6 you know the
childhood poverty rate is putting money back into working families. So it makes it a little easier for
people with families. So those three things immigration, post office and tax policy we’re always looking
for ways for things to keep pushing on. Reach out I’ll put my phone in the chat I’m always happy to talk.

Questions and Answers.
- The

The representative from the District Attorney’s Office Honorable Darcel Clark said that our
office offers a virtual program for young people and we have an adult component as well Concept
Program. So the program is a life-skills to give young people tools to form healthy relationships, strength
in problem solving skills and become productive members of their communities. So I put my information
in the chat. If anyone is interested in receiving these workshops on gang awareness, substance abuse this
program is targeted from the 5"" grade up to the 12"" grade. We have the adult workshops so if anyone is
interested, for those free programs please feel free to email me or call me and I’ll send you our brochure
and we can go on from there. Additionally the DA is working to having another gun buy event. Right
now we don’t have a set date yet but hopefully by next month’s meeting, will be able to provide you with
that.

Ms. Josephine Fernandez-Byrne Chairperson Education & Youth Committee said that on
Thursday, February 11"" we and the Municipal Services Committee had a meeting with the Executive
Director Richard Berlin of DREAM school and several of the other representatives from the school. The
DREAM is actually being rehabbed right now on Bruckner Blvd. just before the 3 Avenue bridge. The
reason we tabled the letter of support of the project because there were several concerns of the safety of
the children crossing. Most of you know the Bruckner and especially the Bruckner leading up to the 3
Avenue bridge as busy as that is all times of the day and they wanted to put a new crosswalk in the middle
of the block for the children to cross into the entrance. One entrance is going to be on Bruckner Blvd. and
the other one is going to be on 132"" street and that’s where the school buses and people bringing their
children by car. But the concern there was that was a private street and I don’t believe they had total
permission to use that block to bring the school buses in or to discharge the children. So because of those
concerns Mr. Yahmadi and myself decided that the Committee could not vote on a letter of support until
everyone met with the Department of Transportation to find out what their concerns were if they were
going to give them the right to have a new crosswalk in the middle of the block on Bruckner Blvd. So
wewill come back to the Board with whatever happens at the meeting with DOT.

Ms. Brenda Goodwin Chairperson Health-Human Services and Seniors said that I have a
couple of things I want to report on. One an agency came before me they have acquired a building at 529
Morris Avenue Narco Freedom building. They are coming to us just for informational purposes and they
will be at the next meeting. Care for the Homeless I’m not going to go into explaining anything I want

Pg. 9

them to explain what they want to do at 529 Morris Avenue they will be at the next meeting. Secondly, I
know everyone is into computers not everybody receives emails and we can’t forget about our
homebound seniors. They are having a hard time getting this vaccine, they’re suppose to get the vaccine
with their Home Attendant. Lincoln Hospital is reaching out to the homebound seniors and bringing them
in for the vaccine with their Home Attendant. I need people to understand a lot of people are using up
their minutes to try to get through to get tested for a vaccine date. If you know of anybody and you can
help them please do so. We need to do a little better modern technology is fine but everyone doesn’t do
email and people are telling me that they stay on the phone forever just trying to get an appointment. We
on the Community Board and Community Activist have to do more specifically for the seniors. Another
thing I wanted to say we are doing our best out here I know some of my Health Committee members can’t
come out but I’d like to thank them because they always have open door policy. Anybody on the
Community Board can reach out to me I’m going out and helping the seniors they’re not being serviced as
they should be. So please let me know if someway I can be of help.

Motion made to accept the Committee Reports as presented. Motion duly seconded. Motion called and
passed.

The District Manager Cedric L. Loftin said that the issue of long lines outside the various banks
that we have in the District. I’ve reached out to the banks and waiting for a response to see if we can a
meeting with those banks at the Economic Development-Land Use & Housing Committee. To see what
can be done understanding this is a time of COVID. We understand some variables put in place before
COVID are problematic and still are, so we’re awaiting a response. As soon as I receive a response, I’Il
set up a meeting to see if we can get some structure. I just wanted to report back to the Board.

Ms. Arline Parks said that JP Morgan is sponsoring something called the 2021North of American

NEW BUSINESS

Board Member Freddy Perez, Jr. said that you know we’ve had a pretty bad year in terms of
robberies, shootings, stabbings in the District. All the networks have reported on this daily. I respectfully
request that you reach out to the 40"" Precinct and ask the Commander to give the BFoard a report during
the next Full Board meeting about what is being done it’s been months since we hear anything from law
enforcement and they haven’t been to our meetings in a long time we really need to hear from them. I
respectfully request to have the come before the Board to tell us what they’re doing to curb this trend

Questions and Answers

Ms. Catherine Garcia-Bou ERSEA Manager Early Childhood Education Division said that I'm just here talk
about some early childhood education programs and the conditions of early childhood in your district. So
we are a Head Start program and I am part of a Social Service Agency Cardinal

McCluskey. In our Early Childhood Division we service over a thousand children in the South Bronx so
one of the crises that we're having is that our programs are only 50 percent enrolled. We serve children and
families in the ages from zero to five in your community and these are free programs, so we offer social
services and referrals when required with breakfast, lunch for the children and educational services from
8:30 to 4:30 but we are only at 50 percent capacity because of COVID so I'm here just to let the community
know and you can call me or email me and I can connect any family that you're working with, with the
proper program, But I just want to let you know that we will be opening F ebruary 22nd that's plan for in
person services. We have three locations 629 Courtlandt Avenue, 560 Concord Avenue and 690
Westchester Avenue. But if you have any families with young children or Moms who need day care we are
happy to enroll the child and service those families. I just want to say we service homeless families.

CHAIRMAN & DISTRICT MANAGER’S REPORT

Mr. Cedric L. Loftin District Manager said let me give the Board some background related to this
matter. A couple of weeks ago I received an email from one of the residents of this facility stating that
they had received notification from the Department of Homeless Services that they would be relocated
out of this facility to another location. The new known location was not provided at that time,
subsequently I had a meeting out of my Borough Service Cabinet meeting with all the agencies that
include the Department of Homeless Services. At that particular time they would not state fully what was
the timeframe that the transfer was to take place, but they did state that the transfer would include a
family shelter subsequently becoming a shelter for men. So once that notification occurred, I reached out
to them and informed them that they would have to come before the Board to talk about the entire process
and why the change had taken place. From the last conversation I had with the Department of Homeless
Services we have about 15 to 16 shelters in the district starting from a period going back at least 10 years.

Ms. Nicole Jordan Bronx Director Department of Homeless Services said that I’ve been in this
position for almost 4 years and in 2017 I came to the district and about that time say you had about 30
Department of Homeless Services sites, I remember that number because that was when I first started. At
that time DHS was presenting Turning the Tide Initiative to decrease the footprint of homelessness in the
city we started that by removing clusters. The reasons we removed clusters because clusters were
apartments that the city rented in buildings going back 20 years and what happened was that it wasn’t a
very good environment for our families because it didn’t have any resources in that building to assist
them day-to-day. The Mayor created the initiative to freeze and get us out of clusters at about 3,800 at its
highest and about 80 percent of those were in the Bronx. So we’re almost completely out of all the
clusters of almost 3 thousand lessening the footprint. There has been a huge decrease in Community
Board 1.

So we’re here today as Mr. Loftin mentioned I notified him that we were doing a transfer and what that is
it’s not an opening of a shelter. It is a shelter that already existed on 134"" Street for adult families, adult
families are all over the age of 18. So they could be couples, an uncle who has custody of his nephew any
of those adult situations. So we are transferring a profile of adult families from the 134"" Street shelter to
single adults. The reason for that is with the Pandemic our census has been seeing an increase in single
adults coming into our system and as you know with homelessness the shelter system has a mandate to
provide housing for anyone that comes into our district. So what we’re doing is a profile transfer in this
particular space to give an opportunity because the numbers for single adults have increased to have a
place to stay. The adult families that were previously at that location are being transferred now some
were able to seek placement with an apartment others that are not ready yet for whatever the reason may
be, employment issues or could be a number of other issues are transferred to other adult locations that
will be able to help them get on their feet and get to permanency.

Pg.3

So I have on line today the Assistant Commissioner Cindy Teta and she is Commissioner of single adults
and she will be able to answer your questions in detail about that particular population at DHS and I have
the Vice President of Westhab the provider that will be running the 134"" Street shelter and has run it
previously when it was for adult families Valerie Smith. So I will turn it over to Ms. Smith.

Ms. Valerie Smith said that like Ms. Jordan said I represent the provider Westhab we have been at this
location since 2017 we were adult families. We got the call from DHS informing us that the population
was going up and we would be housing single men. So we have been in the community for quite some
time. I think that we’ve done a fairly good job in servicing the families that have been placed with us.
During the Pandemic we were fortunate enough to be able to exceed housing placement that was placed
on my facility on 134"" we were supposed to move 25 families my team that works actually moved 34
families during the Pandemic. I would say that’s exceptional work considering that the city was closed
for a period of time. However our sense was that working at the shelter was essential my team and J have
continued to show up to provide services to these families that were with us during the Pandemic. We are
committed to during the same for the population that we’re getting singles and we’re going to be working
with them from whatever barriers they come to us with so we can move them that closer to permanent
housing. So that is Westhab’s commitment to the community and to those persons placed in our facility.

Questions and Answers

Mr. Cedric L, Loftin said Assistant Commissioner what we’d like to see is that one we’re just starting
the budget year now we’re in preliminary budget and moving forward could you provide to us one the
number of facilities that are planning for possible conversion use that are new in Board | in this calendar
year of 2021 and also going forward in fiscal year 2022. So we can start with that and at least we'll know
what’s coming into the community. There’s a disconnect not so much sometimes from the Department of
Homeless Services but let’s say the legislative process and therefore by the time we know the changes
have been made. On this site it was only because of someone that had been present in the shelter and
concerned that they had to be moved out of the shelter that we were informed and when | asked for the
time frame, they were told they would be leaving by the 25"" of January and that is not the right protocol
to have.

We want to thank you for coming Assistant Commissioner and Ms. Jordan but please know that this is an
issue on the forefront of notification and proper protocols in place for that notification. We ask that you
stay in contact we may be asking you to come back again.

PUBLIC HEARING

Mr. Cedric L. Loftin said that this item has come before the Economic Development-Land Use &
Housing Committee twice once in January and previously in October. This is a ULURP voting item. I
will now defer to the Chairperson of the Committee.

Pg. 4

Ms. Arline Parks Chairperson Economic Development-Land Use & Housing said that I’m
going to give the particulars on the project. As Mr. Loftin said this project came before the Economic
Development-Land Use & Housing Committee on two separate occasions and they appeared before us to
request a formal letter of support to rezone the development site. The development site is located at 261
Walton Avenue. It is a site where currently there is a warehouse that used to be a storage facility and it
was involved in a really substantial fire about maybe two years ago. The project Developers are as
follows, it is a joint venture between the JCAL Group and the owner of the warehouse, Management
Agent probably is SoBRO. What they’re proposing to develop on the site is to build 193 units of
affordable housing which will be financed by HPD’s ELLA Program. The site will also include
commercial space on the ground floor that is planned for a supermarket for the location. The HPD’s
ELLA Program is for very low income families and the project is estimated to have about 200
construction jobs of which 25 of them will be permanent and the group made a commitment to hiring
locally.

The first time they came they had a large number of one-bedroom units but after hearing the concerns of
the Committee they actually reduced the number of one bedroom units and increased the number of three-
bedroom units so that more individuals with families can be helped. So that said we deliberated and
asked the Committee for any concerns or issues they had before the item was voted. There was a motion
made to grant a letter of support by Alberto Torres for the project with the stipulation that the letter of
support be granted subject to the project meeting the terms and conditions of the ELLA Program, that
motion was seconded, there was a roll call vote and the project did not pass by the Committee to grant a
letter of support for the project. There was subsequent to that a request that was made of the Committee
that any concerns that the Committee Members had relevant vote why they felt that the could not grant a
letter of support for the project I asked them to submit their concerns in writing so that I could share that
with the Board. When the Board took a vote on the matter, it would take the vote on the context of the
issues that transpired at the Committee. So the list that I received why the Committee Members that were
present voted no was that when the presenters came back a second time they were requested to come back
with a better clarification of the issue regarding the fire and they felt like the second time around they
came back with the exact same presentation and they didn’t come back with the Fire Marshall report.
They also made a representation that the fire took place in the basement but a Committee Member
actually took the time to look up the news reports that other issues caused the fire so they did their due
diligence. The other issue was that there was no response to the issue whether the tenants that had stored
their property there had been made whole. The other serious issue is if you have business with or work
for an entity that is doing business with the Developer you must recuse yourself from the vote. The other
issue just in the interest of full disclosure was that someone was present at the meeting who is employed
by an Elected Official should not have been at that meeting voting at all, but he left the meeting and after
the vote was passed, we did not allow him to vote. Then there was the other issue of Committee
Members understanding why the project was being presented well in advance of the project being
considered by HPD and/or the City Planning Commission. So with that said those were the issues why
the Committee did not vote to support the project. At the same time the project gets affordable housing
capacity at some point in the future to affordable mixed income housing for workforce individuals.

The project if it weren’t for as-of-right it is privately owned they could develop it the owners and it would
be market rate for whatever the market would bear for that location. So the project affords the district the
opportunity to get some affordable housing at that location, so that’s the pro side of it. There were other
issues that were raised around the Master Plan for Urban Development in the district for what we have
here and if we continue to have a transactional based approach you will have a lot of individual

Pg.5

development sites that might actually be cumulatively detrimental to the community. So let it be clear it’s
a letter of support from Community Board 1 to rezone that location so that they can rise the height of the
project which is not out of context with all the other development there and with about 193 units of
affordable housing. So that completes my report so now I am turning the matter over to the Board for
their vote and consideration of this project given all of the information that was presented. So District
Manager or Madam Chair could you open up the floor to the Board Members present so that they can ask
about any issues, questions or concerns.

Mr. Cedric L. Loftin said you’ve heard from the Chairperson of the Committee that this issue was
reviewed and vetted. The last time it was vetted was at this last meeting this month and the vote from the
Committee was a no with a stipulation. So the floor is now open to any other questions related to the
project before the vote is taken by the Full Board, the floor is opened.

Questions and Answers

Ms. Lauren George Constantinople & Vallone LLC said that the key question we’re addressing is
the unit distribution. As Ms. Parks mentioned this is an area as-of-right and this proposal is for 100
percent income restricted of which 40 percent would be under HPC regulations. This is proposed as an
ELLA extremely low affordable building which has different household income levels and unit sizes. Due
to the (MIH) Mandatory Inclusionary Housing no matter what happens here it would require that 25
percent of the units here or the floor area here whenever it’s built is permanently affordable. This
development team intends and proposes to build a 100 percent affordable building. The unit distribution
again we’re talking about 193 units roughly and that’s because we added three-bedroom units so there’s
fewer than the original proposal so this is a breakdown for you to look at. This is a proposal with the
exact unit and AMI breakdown after being vetted and approved by HPD so that’s something we want to
be clear on so this is proposed as an ELLA Project which is the lowest affordable project that there is. I
don’t know if anyone else wants to speak up but I can just say I represent JCAL and I believe in them
community engaged, have their office in the neighborhood, care about the neighborhood and they want to
create long-term benefits for all with different income levels for the neighborhood. I believe the street
scape could be greatly improved with trees and plantings and all the required amenities. It would be a
benefit in lots of ways for safety for eyes on the street I think it’s a positive.

Mr. John Wolfling Architect said that Lauren just made a good point about activating the street, there
will be an active streetscape with trees and plants I think this will be a great addition to the neighborhood.

Motion made to grant a letter of support on the rezoning of 261 Walton Avenue to allow for a proposed
mixed use 193 unit 100 percent income restricted building under HPD’s ELLA Program with the
stipulation that letter of support be granted subject to the project meeting the terms and conditions of the
ELLA Project. Motion duly seconded. The roll was called and there were 15-Yes, 3-No and 2-
Abstentions. The item passed.

Motion made to approve the Chairman and District Manager’s Report. Motion duly seconded.

ELECTED OFFICIALS REPORTS

The representative for the Honorable Ruben Diaz, Jr. The Bronx Borough President said
just two quick announcements. For new Board Members that are looking to apply to the Community
Board the applications are out. If anyone on the Board knows of someone that would be a good fit on the
Board encourage them to apply and the applications have to be in by February 5"". On the new
application there is a meeting attendance form normally we would have people attend the meeting and
have the District Manager signoff or the Chairperson, but since the meetings have been taking place
virtually so there’s an attendance sheet So just signoff on the General Board meeting you went too then
you can scan a copy to us and mail us the original. For Board Members that are up for reappointment
same thing reappointment applications are due back in our office February 5"" scan a copy over to us and
then mail the original. If anyone has any questions, if you have any difficulties feel free to call me at any
time.

The representative for the Honorable Congressman Richie Torres said this Board is like a
family to me so I’m looking forward to be as helpful as I could. I just want to give a few quick updates
the Congressman has been in DC. The biggest priorities are the vaccine rollouts. We are in the process
of starting a coalition with all the other Congress people and looking to see what the status is with the
vaccine doses. But all this week 12 million New Yorkers out of 15 million 60 years and older were
targeted for were deemed recipients unfortunately there was a holdover with some of the producing
companies. There’s also that the Bronx the South Bronx especially is not getting enough doses of the
vaccine and so we’re working to collaborate with the other people in the State so that we can not only fast
track the production of those doses but make sure that people in the district in Mott Haven, Melrose and
the South Bronx in general can get the information they need especially since there’s language outreach
issues people are not speaking French they’re not speaking Arabic so we’re looking to make sure
everyone is represented.

The representative for Honorable State Senator Jose M. Serrano said that there are several
things that I would like to underline so the first thing that the States COVID19 Rent Relief Program has
reopened and applications will be accepted through Monday, February 1, 2021, so the programs eligibility
criteria has been expanded to provide rent relief to more New Yorkers. So you can call our office at 212
~ 828-5829 if you need assistance with the application process. Second the COVID19 Emergency
Eviction and Foreclosure Protection Act of 2020 by the New York State Senate ensures New York renters
and homeowners effected by COVID19 Pandemic can safely remain in their homes. You can visit the
Senator’s website senator.nysenate.gov to fill out the Hardship Declaration application. Then regarding
the vaccines you have had your first dose but don’t have information about your second dose you can call
our office and we can assist you getting the time and location for your second dose you can call our office
and we can assist you getting the time and location for your second dose. Today the Governor signed a
Senate bill that prohibits the unnecessary application of a dangerous herbicide in State parklands and
parks in New York State it is a first step in cutting back on herbicide usage. Finally the State Senate
voted to pass a bill amending Article 1 of the Bill of Rights to add a new section establishing
environmental rights the new bill would mean that each person has the right to air and water and a healthy
environment. The bill is expected to pass the New York State Assembly and in November 2021 the
people of New York will have the opportunity to vote for this constitutional amendment by referendum.
This resolution ensure that environmental protocols are protected for the public health so I think that’s a
first step for us.

Pg.7

Honorable State Senator Luis Sepulveda said I want to thank everyone on the Board for allowing
me to address you today. A lot of things happening at the State level that I want to discuss but I want to
remind people that there’s still a problem of food and security in our community. We continue to try to
feed people I provide as much food as we can, so that there’s no reason why anybody in our community
should go to bed hungry, so if you know of anyone that needs food please have them call my office. In
our district we’ve done well over 35 food distribution events in the last few months we don’t discontinue
because its cold we still have to feed people. When we look at what’s happening with COVID we’re now
about 7.5 positivity again we are the highest in the City of New York. Our communities continue to be
ravished by COVID but yet as you can see even though we’re pushing the Governor and the Mayor to
make sure that bring these vaccines to our community after the essential workers, still falling behind. J
read a report recently that said only about 5 percent of people in communities of color have gotten the
vaccine as opposed to over 20 something percent in more affluent neighborhoods, so we as Elected
Officials have to continue to fight against that. We’ve had healthcare issues many, many years in this
county 62 out 62, at least I will not allow for our communities to be ignored. We have to get these
vaccines to us immediately to make sure that our seniors and families are protected. I am working with
an organization a Health Care Provider Essen they’re doing fantastic work in terms of getting people
vaccinated. If you want to go you have to make an appointment and you have to qualify and they’re
lowering the requirements so that more people can qualify. So anyone who needs it please make sure that
you call Essen. My office information will be put on the chat you can contact us and we can direct you
and help you.

It is now that part of the year where we’re doing the budget in Albany if anyone has a program and they
want to do a budget request for us please let us know. If you want to do that do it now if you’re a non-
for-profit or any organization that wants to seek funding reach out to our office and will make sure that
we put you in the path and help you fill out the forms, either way do it as soon as possible.

We have passed a series of legislation that is aimed at expanding Absentee Ballot access for people and
lowering the number of signatures you need to qualify, that’s important because we don’t want people out
there in the community knocking on doors getting COVID or transmitting COVID. It’s critical that we
lower that number so that we can protect our community before the election. It’s also going to allow for
remote participation of a party designation stuff and protect our residents that live in Nursing Homes.
Last week we also passed a series of packages that helps small businesses we extended the Eviction and
Foreclosure moratorium we’re seeing a lot of storefronts that are closing down and we have to stop that
because small businesses have always been the life blood of our community. If we lose them we lose a
lot of economic development in our community and services they provide. We also expanded the
Employment Insurance Benefits for employees. Now one important thing about unemployment the New
York State Department of Labor is implementing the Hours Based Rule what that means that if before
you were a part-time worker you were not entitled to getting unemployment benefits, with this new
program being implemented even if you work part-time for those hours that you’re not working you will
be entitled to unemployment benefits. It’s good because now it gives you an incentive to continue to
work part-time employment. The State has also extended the foreclosure moratorium until May 1* for
tenants that can prove that they are suffering economically because of COVID. Now there is a Hardship
Declaration Form that has to be filled out. Any landlord that is going to attempt to evict a tenant, to
provide that tenant with that form. If any of you foresee any problems for you, family or friends make
sure that they get that Hardship Form or let us know in our office we have a series of Lawyers helping to
prevent evictions. I myself in my first life was a Housing Lawyer for about 28 years so I get involved
personally with anybody facing any potential eviction. We are also I want to remind everyone about the
COVID Rent Relief Program that was created 100 million dollars to help people pay their rent, the

Pg. 8

applications will end on February 1‘. So if you or anyone you know is in need of rent relief please make
sure that you fill this form out on or before Monday, February 1* if not you might miss out on an
Opportunity of receiving assistance to pay your rent. The applications for relief of your rent you can get it
at the Department of Housing and Community Renewal and they’re number is 1-833-499-0318 or email
covidrentrelief@hcr.ny.gov you make sure you apply if you need it. Now our offices are clearly closed
because of COVID but we working at the same pace we have before COVID. We have helped between 6
and 7 hundred individuals navigate the process of getting their unemployment. I can tell you the number
of people that get frustrated and give up do not give up, give us call we want to make sure that you get
your unemployment benefits, we’re also helping with SNAP, cash assistance and Medicaid. I want to tell
everyone that we’re going to also be passing legislation that I will co-sponsor the primary sponsor is one
of my colleagues that is going to require the Department of Labor for their office to increase and provide
news about the Share Work Program and information about eligibility. Remember that Share Work
Program can reduce layoffs significantly and this is fully funded by the Federal Cares Act. The New
York State Department of Labor has a website and it has about 30 to 40 thousand jobs listed, so if anyone
you know is looking for a job we encourage you to go to that website. Again you can call our office and
our number is 718 —991-3161 or at team@senatorsepulveda.com. If you need don’t be shy reach out to us
we look forward to each and everyone of you calling us and asking for help. We are not out of this by
any stretch of the imagination and again if you want vaccines let us know, Yankee Stadium is not opened
yet but it’s going to become a large location for vaccinations. Bless you all and stay safe.

Questions and Answers

The representative for the Honorable Scott Stringer New York City Comptroller said that I
am the Bronx Borough Director for Comptroller Stringer which means I go to community meetings to let
the community know the work our office is doing. There’s a lot that the Comptroller has been doing for
equity in the city with the vaccine and making sure that students have an appropriate way to learn. But
Pm going to focus on just two things so one I’m going to put it in the chat again, we are having a South
Bronx Town Hall, what that means is that it’s an opportunity for the Comptroller to hear directly from the
residents about what the issues are. It’s going to be on Wednesday the 3"" at 6 PM he’s a citywide elected
official so everyone is welcome. We focusing on Community Boards 1, 2 and 3 you have to RSVP in
order to attend the meeting and the meeting will be simultaneously translated in Spanish. Secondly which
is also exciting is that we are going to be having a summer Internship Program it is paid for
Undergraduate and Graduate students and have to be enrolled in college in order to apply, the application
deadline is March 5"". I’m going to put my information on the chat.

The representative for the Honorable Councilwoman Diana Ayala said that I just want to
announce that the Councilmember has been recently appointed as the new Chair of the Committee of
Consumer Affairs which has the jurisdiction over the city’s Department of Consumer Affairs including
practices and policies related to consumer rights. As the newly appointed Chair the Councilmember is
extremely honored and excited to have been appointed the Chair of said committee. Having witnessed
the committee’s oversight in the protection of women’s issues she’s extremely thrilled to building with
her colleagues, As State Senator Sepulveda had indicated it is budget season and at this particular time
applications for discretionary and capital funding has commenced, on January 4"" it started. Those
organizations seeking to apply for discretionary funding that started January 4"" as I indicated the
submission deadline is Tuesday, February 16th. As well as the capital applications as well, those
applications the deadline there is Thursday, February 25"". It only applies if your requesting funding from

Pg.9

the Council or the Department of Cultural Affairs. Also want to highlight that Councilmember Ayala and
Councilmember Gibson earlier this month have written a letter to the New York Yankees requesting that
and urging them for the stadium to become one of the vaccine hubs, as you all know City Fields had
opened its doors. As State Senator Sepulveda said it seems that Yankee Stadium will be one of those 24
hour access points for Bronx residents but more so for those who live in the South Bronx. The
last thing I want to say in reference to that homeless project Councilmember Ayala and
Representative Torres just last week sent a letter to DHS in opposition of said transferring out of
the shelter, they stand with this Board. In the chat I sent over to the District Manager a copy of
said letter. The Councilmember got on the phone with the folks from the Mayor’s Office and
just basically gave them the riot act, this is not an issue of being anti-shelter, I myself was once
homeless. Yes we know our people are utilizing these services, we understand that but at the
same time we need to ensure that the Administrations in the present and the future adhere to the
Fair Share Policies. Why should we bear the brunt of these types of facilities. Okay maybe at
one point we had 30 and now we’re down to 13 they’re not taking into consideration the other
social services. So that being said we took the initiative and spoke to Representative Torres
basically expressed our opposition and at this point we indicated to DHS and they have not
responded to us that we’re in total opposition to the change in profile. Which quite frankly the
original idea was to help families who were homeless to get back on their feet and then to
mislead everyone during their presentation to say oh at that site in 2017 there were men. The
men that were part of that shelter were part of the families. So with that being said I conclude.

A motion was made to approve the Elected Officials Reports as presented. Motion duly seconded.
Motion called and passed.

COMMITTEE REPORTS
= Economic Development-Land Use & Housing & Education & Youth

Mr. Cedric L. Loftin said it was approved by the Committee. In reference to a BSA
Application for rezoning of a site that is presently in an M1-4 zone. The present site of the
school is 164 Bruckner the school has been there over 10 years it was the old site of the
Golden Lady a strip club that they ended up renovating and taking over. At this point their
space is limited so they’re looking to fit this extension into the M zone to open a school there.
They are talking about having the new school at 2500 Park Avenue at East 135"" Street in an
M1-4 Zone. I will give you briefly some parameters of the school, they will serve lower
school kindergarten, fourth grade and then extended to a middle school in 2018. The school
currently serves 388 students. The school seeks to construct a new school which will be used
for the middle school and anticipated high school. The demand for seats has been
consistently higher than the space that they’re in. Classes are being consolidated and studios
are being used for classrooms, the auditorium multi-purpose room converted into a music
room and a library and now an eight grade classroom. The new premises which is on a
regular lot on Park Avenue and 135"" Street, the premises is located in 100 feet in the MX
zone, R7 zone which is adjacent to the site, that’s why they need expansion and zoning action

Pg. 10

related to it. The proposed project consists of construction of a 6-story building for a total
floor area of approximately 1908 sq. ft. The building would consist of a new gymnasium,
bleachers a large theatre, for 6"" through 12 grade a robotics lab, a graphic studio, science lab
and multi-media center, dance studio an orchestra room a greenhouse and various offices in
the school and anticipate enrollment of approximately 770 students. So this is the item that
came to the Committee on January 8"". The Committee approved the project and now it
comes before the Full Board for approval at this particular time. Also at the presentation was
the legal team and the Principal of the school.

So that’s the item you have before you and the Chair apologizes for not being here.

Motion made to grant a letter of support to the South Bronx Charter School for
International Cultures and the Arts for their request to the Board of Standards and Appeals for
a special permit pursuant to Zoning Resolution Section 73-19 to construct a new Use Group 3

BETTY BRYANT-BROWN MINUTES eee

CHAIRPERSON

Ms. Betty Bryant-Brown, Chairperson opened the meeting with a prayer.

A moment of silence was observed in memory on the passing of Boardmember John
Johnson.

Mr. Cedric L. Loftin, District Manager said that Mr. Johnson was a tremendous person and an
outstanding member of the community, he will be missed.

A motion was made to approve the Agenda as presented. Motion duly seconded. Motion called and
passed.

Mr. Cedric L. Loftin, District Manager said good evening everyone and it has been a stressful year,
I want to thank everyone for their service as we move towards 2021. T just want to report on some items
from over the last month in the district like yesterdays snowstorm. Since that snowstorm I have been in
contact with Sanitation making sure that preparations were made and in place. I wanted to give you an
after action report spoke to the Mayor’s Office later this afternoon and I’ve been in contact with agencies
with respect to what has transpired. So as you know we deal with two agency types here in Board One
hard services and soft services. I’m going to go through the hard services agencies first then will move on
to the soft services agencies.

First, we’re going to start with the 40"" Precinct. At this point from last night’s storm there have not been
any areas to the storm that the Police Department has not been able to handle, so everything is good with
that respect. In regard to the Fire Department there were no calls that came through regarding snow
activity within the district. There were not any injuries reported by EMS nor any response to
engagements by the Fire Department. That report came through the Fire Chief of the district and the
other report came through the Inspector of the 40"" Precinct. The next item has to deal with NYCHA we
have over 19 developments here in Board One. I will tell you with those 19 developments historically
there have been problems. As we cycle into the fall and winter months there is a problem with delivery of
services especially with heat and hot water. So based upon last nights events I did not get any calls from
anyone in the district related to issues made to any of the Managers of NYCHA and also a call was made
to the overall General Manager of NYCHA for the City of New York although I have not received any
reports. Please be advised that I will stay in connect with NYCHA periodically every other day because
historically unfortunately there’s been a problem here in the district because of the level of conditions on
the service delivery in NYCHA leading to its infrastructure and also related to all the service use.

Pg.2

There has been money that was supposed to flow from Washington to NYCHA that has not flowed
substantially so there are several developments that still have issues related to heat and hot water
conditions and a lot of these developments have problems with the risers as far as bringing heat and hot
water to the upper levels. This has been a long standing point raised with NYCHA at borough levels and
beyond and still the money has not been flowing. Hopefully with new Administration there will be a
change in policy on the direction and flow of monies. After realizing what kind of fiscal deficit the
country is in now you will not know that until October. But at this point we will just continue to monitor
NYCHA. Ifyou know of anyone that has an issue at one of our NYCHA developments even if it’s not
you that resides there please send me an email so that we can follow up with the appropriate Manager at
the development no matter what the issue is even if outside of the borders of service delivery or if it’s a
security issue that has come to your attention please contact and send an email to the Community Board
so that it can be rectified as soon as possible.

Let’s move on to our soft services as to Sanitation throughout the district as you know we’ve received a
lot of snow. The Sanitation Superintendent has been on point related to the removal of that snow. At this
point they have a compliment of men and women that are out in the district doing snow removal with all
of the equipment that they have available including the bobcats that generally you see in smaller and
narrower streets going through removing snow out of the district at crosswalks and corner locations, As
far as refuse removal on the corners and baskets that is going to happen shortly after the snow is removed,
you can put out your garbage and refuse at this point. If anyone feels that there has been a lag time as far
as the pickup of your refuse shoot me an email so that I can reach out to the Superintendent to make sure
that your refuse is picked up appropriately, but all garbage will be picked up. As to transportation, the
Department of Transportation has everything moving along with the MTA’s work. It was only one
condition that we had earlier today where there was an issue with the No. 2 line where there was a
disruption in service but that has been rectified. As far as service delivery through New York City Transit
is handling it. Going back to DOT as far as traffic that flows into the district all the bridges are free, one
of the bridges had a shut down as far as from Manhattan into the Bronx and has been rectified and closed
out. Now moving on to Parks, the Department of Parks as you know works with Sanitation. The
perimeter of all of our parks they’re going to be cleaned and monitored not only by the Parks Department
but also by the Department of Sanitation to ensure that all of the entranceways are opened. Now the
Parks Department has a program where they actually go into the parks and look at all of the trees within
the park to make sure that the conditions are stable and make sure that no one is hit by any falling limbs
within the park. All of that’s in place at this point there are no trees or branches down at any of the parks
in the district. As far as DEP they are working with Sanitation and DOT to make sure that all of the catch
basins at the corners of our streets are clear of snow so any runoff can flow freely down the street into the
catch basin and into the system. We have not gotten any complaints related to that. The next thing as far
as a soft agency I’d like to report out on is related to work being done around Lincoln Hospital of the
removal of trees and also the condition as you can see around Lincoln on Morris and 149 Street that the
sidewalk has come up because the of the tree roots which will be removed and smoothed out so that
condition will not happen anymore.

So that is everything related to all the hard and soft services regarding what has transpired with the
snowstorm as of yesterday. Every evening I get a late report around 11 o’clock and it tells me what the
conditions are in the different aspects within the district. Now with the snow that report comes to me
related to the conditions. So I will be able to know what the conditions are and we can get them rectified
to make sure that they don’t impact on anyone’s life here. As you know a school was not opened today,
but it’s my understanding the school will be opened tomorrow. The last point which is not part of city
jurisdiction but is part of what we deal with which is Con Ed. There have not been any outages of power

Pg.3

here in the district. There are not any outages in the Bronx except in the northern portion of the Bronx but
not here where everyone had full services throughout the storm.

I want to get to another point that has come up that we have to deal with, earlier this week I was part of a
Zoom meeting related to the issue of COVID 19 and it’s impact here in our district. After that meeting I
had a discussion with Lincoln Hospital of delivery of the vaccine, the Piser Vaccine that has to be handled
in cold storage and it’s now at Lincoln Hospital for use by the personnel there. Also my understanding at
about an hour ago the Mederna Vaccine has been approved by the FDA Drug Administration. This
vaccine does not need cold storage and will also be delivered to the city hospital system of Health &
Hospital Corporation. Now as we know we’re in the first portion of the distribution and the persons to
receive the vaccine are persons working in the hospitals both public, private and also Nursing Homes. So
I just want everyone to know that the second phase of it has not come down yet will probably happen
sometime in the middle or late spring. I’m not telling anyone to go past what they think they’re own
personal preference is related to the vaccine’s administration. Point by Dr. Facha that individuals under
the age of 16 have to take the vaccine, that’s the Piser Vaccine. Just been informed as far as the Mederna
that individuals under the age of 18 take the vaccine. So this vaccine is out in the y area New York is
going to be getting more deliveries of it. Johnson and Johnson is coming out with their own vaccine
probably in the next month and the vaccine will be available. What I would tell people at this point you
know what we as a district went through last year with the Corona Virus we were ground zero and we lost
more people than any other portion of the Bronx and as I expressed to everyone before we had people
coming from Elmhurst a hotspot coming over to the Bronx for treatment. | was also informed even
though the vaccine is not available but will be available it’s still necessary for people to do what they’ve
been doing before related to their health to still mask, social distance and to frequently wash your hands.
None of that will change although the vaccine will be available and you take it. Now going back to the
Piser Vaccine it’s a two process vaccine you take the first shot and weeks later you get a second shot.
Now I will tell you something that I know everyone has heard the adverse effect on some persons after
taking the shot, that was also discussed. Under the Biden Administration there will not be any cost in
receiving the vaccine.

The last thing I wanted to touch on is related to the State Budget, there is a 15 billion budget gap. As you
know or may have heard that the Senate and the House are looking at the possibility finding funding
under the Cares Act and the provisions thereof. However it’s also said but I haven’t seen the last
proposals yet the amount that is going to be given out may be half of what individuals received in the first
Cares Act. We will not know what’s going to happen until President Biden is sworn in. So there’s
probably going to be some gaps in the system because there is a shortfall the Senate is not looking to pass
any funds that would help municipalities including state municipalities. So there will be some issues with
funding levels the Governor has said that once President Elect Biden becomes President funding streams
will open up. At this point that is where things are the budget from the state is also reflective of the city
budget and has shortfalls associated with it but we have not heard anything related to reduction of
services under this years current budget which runs through June 30"" of this year. So that’s where we are
in respect to the budget, that’s where we are in respect to COVID and to what transpired yesterday.

Unfortunately the situation we’ve been in under this COVID has been something that we’ve not gone
through before but I will say that the cases coming out of our district have been miniscule compared to
other districts here in the Bronx over the past period of time since Thanksgiving of people contracting and
having caught the COVID. Just asking people to be steadfast as far as what they’ve been doing with their
families and to be able to stay home if you can but if you have to travel to be safe. They’re
recommending now even if you do travel or in someone else’s home that you continue to wear a mask.
Because you’re in close proximity there’s not much outdoor activity the virus can pass more frequently.

Pg. 4

So I just wanted to report out on some of those things to close out the year. Are there any questions from
anyone on what was reported out?

This concludes my report and as I said if anyone has any issues, please email the Board.

Ms. Brenda Goodwin, Chairperson Health-Human Services & Seniors I spoke to Lincoln
Hospital today and as of today we have 24 patients. We are ready the treatment staff is ready. As you
said Piser was here delivered yesterday. The essential workers clinical and non-clinical will be receiving
the vaccine. I have contacted CVS and Walgreens related to the vaccine and will stay in contact with
them to make sure the community is informed. I just want to ask people to speak to their primary doctor
on an ongoing basis so that they can get the proper information they need about the vaccine.

Mr. Cedric L. Loftin, District Manager said Ms. Goodwin I want to thank you for your persistence
in staying on top of things with Lincoln Hospital, this is a very critical time and as you know we’re really
in very uncharted waters here.

Motion was made to accept the District Manager’s report as presented. Motion duly seconded. Motion
called and passed

The representative for the Honorable Ruben Diaz, Jr. said that first and foremost I hope that
everyone is staying safe and warm inside. I just have a couple of announcements the Borough President
is advocating for everyone to get tested for COVID especially with the recent uptake of COVID cases.
So if anyone needs any assistance in finding a COVID Testing Site that will be something that we will be
able to assist with. If anyone knows of a homebound individual encourage them to call 311 the
Department of Health has self-testing kits and paid for by the Department of Health please send this
information those persons. Board members that term expires 2021 if you haven’t received the re-
appointment applications in the mail you should expect to receive them by the end of this month or you
don’t receive it by the end of this month shoot Tom an email or you can just let Cedric know and he will
inform us. If you know of anyone that’s interested in joining the Community Board applications are due
back in our office February 15"". So if you know of anyone interested refer them over to our website or
can contact me and I’ll email them a copy of the Community Board Application. Lastly, just want to
wish everyone a safe and happy holiday. Thank you for the District Manager, staff and Boardmembers of
bearing with us through this very challenging year. We’re hopeful that 2021 brings a lot more positive
energy.

The representative for State Senator Jose M. Serrano said that we'd like to remind you that our
office is distributing masks and sanitizers to organizations and individuals in need so you can contact us if
you'd like to make a request at 212 — 828-5829. The Senator was reappointed as Chair of the New

York State Senate Majority Conference by the Majority Leader Andrea Stewart Cousins. The Senator
recently participated in a forum on supporting the Immigrants art community during the COVID 19
Pandemic and our office is currently compiling a report to support our artistic and cultural communities
during this difficult time. The Senator is co-sponsoring legislation to extend the addiction moratorium for
1 year following the end of the Pandemic. He’s also co-sponsoring legislation to provide commercial

Pg.5

relief for businesses that are suffering and we know what’s going on in our neighborhoods. Just to
remind you that we still have our full range of constituent services so feel free to reach out to our office.

Honorable State Senator Luis Sepulveda said that first of all I’ve really got to give credit to Cedric
for a fantastic presentation, he stole some of my thunder.

At the Senate we had a retreat last week where we discussed some of the issues that are going to impact
the State going forward. We’re facing about a 13 to 16 billion dollar budget deficit and normally what
happens when you have deficit’s they try to balance the budget on the backs of poor black and brown
communities. So I can tell you that myself and my colleagues in the Senate including Senator Serrano are
fighting like hell to make sure that these proposed cuts do not impact our communities we know how
COVID has devasted where we live. There are vaccines now that are coming and the Governor has
promised that after our essential and medical workers are vaccinated that then he will go to the poor
communities to immigrant communities to make sure that because the number of deaths are so substantial
and because many of our immigrants are essential workers that receive very little in terms of benefits
from federal relief packages or the State we have to make sure that we take care of them. So we are going
to push the Governor to make sure that those second wave of vaccines go to our communities here.

Now we face several problems in our community obviously for years now the Bronx has been at the
bottom in terms of health metrics, has been at the bottom in terms of unemployment, has been at the
bottom in terms of nutrition and we’ve still not been able to shake that, So there is a lot of work that we
have to do as legislators. We face about 3.6 billion dollars in rent arrears in this state and that impacts
about 1.2 million people. Before COVID started there was a backlog of about 200 thousand eviction
proceedings in the city. If not for some of the actions that we’ve taken we probably would have seen a
disaster. Now I believe the Governor will continue to extend the moratorium to make sure people aren’t
evicted.

When this all began the Senate Leader creates these working groups to impact and decide on policy and
legislation that is going to impact the State. So one of the areas that she created a working group of
Senators was the issue of housing. Not because in my first life I was a Housing Lawyer the Leader asked
me to participate in this group to create some legislation that we ultimately did and that was the Tenancy
Harbor Act, very important because it protected many people from being evicted I was one of the
Senators that participated in creating that legislation. We’re looking at other options now the second
wave and we have a new President and we still have many challenges that we still have to face. We are
essentially going to make sure that we continue to create legislation to make sure that people stay home
and to raise revenue. We don’t want to wait until a Federal Stimulus Package comes. Probably best case
scenario at this point would be April with the new President I know they’re talking about relief now but
I’m talking about something substantial that’s going to impact our State. We created a 100 million dollar
fund to help people pay rent, the Governor only wanted to give us 50 million. Now for those of us living
in the Bronx we know that 50 million won’t even cover 20 Bronx apartment buildings. So because the
Governor of New Jersey gave as much as 100 million dollars the Governor here essentially it kind of
embarrassed him to give us another 50 million dollars. So we have 100 million dollars but most of that
money has already been used and the application process is no longer available. So we have to do
everything we can to generate more revenue to pay for apartments to pay for small homeowners one to
two families that are at risk of losing their homes because they cannot pay their mortgages. What we
discussed as revenue and I want you all to know so that you know what we’re facing. One of the things
we’re talking about is raising the tax rate from 8.8 to 10.9 for people making over 5 million dollars a year.
I'm limiting deductions for the super wealthy, increasing corporate tax and a tax on petroleum and of

Pg. 6

course giving the okay to expedite the process of opening of casinos. We’re talking about ending tax
breaks for things like yachts, you know we give tax breaks for things like yachts in this State. For planes
they don’t pay a certain level of sales tax all this stuff that essentially helps the super wealthy it’s time for
them to pay their fair share now. Now we hear millionaires are leaving the State of New York in droves
and that is nonsense and I can tell you that if 10 millionaires were to leave the City of New York or State
of New York you’ll find another 50 that want to come here because this is the place where most people of
substantial wealth want to have a foothold in. So we don’t buy the argument that if we raise taxes that
suddenly you’re going to see a major departure of the super wealthy in New York City and New York
State. The reality is they have all this wealth now look what’s happened with Amazon and all these
delivery services is that they’ve quadrupled their overall wealth and if they don’t feel it’s they’re civic
responsibility to pay a little more so that a young child can get food, so that a senior can get their
medication, so that a family can stay in their apartment then I will open the door and make sure that I hit
them in the ass on the way out. It is more important that we take care of our people and if the super
wealthy have a problem with that then adios amigo, we’re not going to stand for that. Food and security
is another major problem in our community, myself and I know other legislators and their elected officials
in City and State have worked overtime to provide free food for many people and we’ve given out
thousands of pounds of food, thousands of pounds of nutritional substance to help people.

Now with the Budget that’s coming up again my colleagues and I in the Bronx are fighting like hell to
make sure we provide additional funding or any federal funding that comes to help programs that feed
people. The Child That Don’t Care Program which provides free food free nutrition to seniors and
children is a program that we have to make sure we provide extra funding for. The Commodity
Supplemental Food Program which feeds people that are approximately 60 years or older is another
program that we have to make sure we fund. With our federal legislators we have to make sure that we
provide money for SNAP part of the federal monies that are used to pay for some of the pantries that are
feeding a lot of people. I wanted people to know that tomorrow morning at 9:30 at Irma Carver Houses I
will be giving out approximately 1000 pounds of produce to people in the surrounding area. That’s Irma
Carver Houses 887 Southern Blvd. So if you or anyone you know needs food, needs produce we invite
them. We’re also going to give out face coverings and PPE’s almost every day or every other day I go
out to our train stations giving out face masks so I’ve given out over 30 thousand face masks since the
Pandemic started, I want to make sure that our people are protected. There are many people who can’t
afford the face masks wear them over and over again and so we try to help as much as we can. So we’ve
been able to secure face masks through different sources, we work closely with the Taiwanese
Government and we were able to secure about a quarter of a million face masks for our Nurses and our
staff that work in medical facilities, but they also gave us here. So if anyone needs face coverings let us
know and we will provide as much as we can we want to make sure that we continue to give face masks
so that people don’t get sick. So many things that are happening now with COVID we see the numbers
that are rising and its incredible what has happened in the past where 34 percent of Latinos were the ones
who died, 29 percent of African Americas who died and predominantly in our poor communities. What
COVID has done that it has brought up to the surface the systemic inequities, I dare say the systemic
racism in economic policy in this county. There’s no reason why we should have what they say is 22
percent unemployment in the Bronx but the real number is closer to 40 percent. There is no reason that
our people should be dying at an incredibly higher rate than wealthy white neighborhoods no reason of
course we all know why, because over the years our governments could give a dam about the Bronx and
so they didn’t invest in our healthcare facilities. The largest employer in the county of the Bronx is the
Healthcare Industry, yet we are 62 out of 62 in terms of health metrics. We have the highest
unemployment rate all that is attributed to again systemic economic and health racists policies that

has put us in this position a and we have not been able to get out of it.

Pg.7

So I’m doing my part to make sure that we hold accountable high levels of government, having constant
conversations with the Governor’s Office working with my colleagues that we get our fair share and that
our people are protected, our people get the kind of services that they’re entitled as tax paying citizens in
this State.

Questions and Answers

The representative for Honorable Scott Stringer the New York City Comptroller said that
the announcement that I have for tonight we publish our annual Making the Grade Report this gives a
grade to each agency related to MWBE contract, Basically from the 22.5 billion dollars on contracts
awarded this past fiscal year only 1.1 million were awarded to MWBE. The city once again got a C grade
so they’re not doing that great and we’re letting the city know that they have to do better. Also at the end
of this month I will be leaving the Comptroller’s Office. It was great working these past two years and a
half with the Comptroller and assisting the community in many ways but I’m going to still be around and
starting in January I will be on the team of Congressman Richie Torres.

The representative for Honorable Councilwoman Diana Ayala said that I want to thank the
Senator for a great civic and public policy discourse definitely some good nuggets in there.

Our festivities this year are very different and it is the Councilmember and members of staff remain
working on the ground to ensure that all communities get the needed resources. As you all know there is
still the transmission of COVID 19 there continues to be spikes and positive cases throughout the city and
within District Council 8. That is why the Councilmember on December 29"""" is hosting a COVID Day of
Testing, day of action and we are doing it in conjunction with Health & Hospitals Corporation and also
Eastside House Settlement from 9:30 AM to 5:30 PM at Mitchell Community Center 210 Alexander
Avenue.

Lastly Councilmember along with Councilmember Mark Levine issued a letter to Commissioner Chosky
asking the Commissioner for the prioritization of individuals with intellectual disabilities and
development disabilities in vaccine distribution, it’s something that needs to be done. We have through
the Department of Aging have been given information that there have been individuals calling seniors and
others calling them and saying that for a very low monetary fee that they can be placed on a vaccine
patient list and can get prioritization, so be mindful of these types of scams.

PUBLIC SESSION
NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY

Ms. Sydney Renwick, Associate Director Government & Community Affairs said that I’m
here just to deliver our Phase 2 which unfortunately to the rising COVID rates we did have to roll back
but we will continue to do our Phase 1 Grab and Go in many of our branches. Our Phase 2 that we did
start on November 9"" included additional services that there were timed sessions for patrons to use
computers because we know and have heard from many of our Elected Officials, patrons and community
members that the need to use technology is paramount and we wanted to make sure to offer that in our
Phase 2 and so that is what we did in the 15 locations that are currently opened. We also have browsing
up to 30 minutes folks can actually browse the stacks because we also heard that it was kind of limiting to
use our service, so it was added to Phase 2. You can request books online and then go pick them up in the
branches, some branches are open for use so you can do that as well. Our virtual offerings are still
plentiful and we do offer then to a variety of age groups so if you’d like to avail yourself, you certainly
keep you updated and when we do go back into Phase 2 expanded service we will definitely update you
on what we’re offering.

Questions and Answers

BELVIS NEW YORK CITY GOTHAM

Ms. Maria Vega said that I’m with Belvis and Cheryl Jones wanted me to introduce you to the Gotham
Centers all around the City. We’re actually doing small businesses and offering services for families and
workers that don’t have any health insurance or cannot afford health insurance so we give NYC Care.
Plus for the people that don’t have any insurance they actually can come and get their COVID19 testing
for free. So we don’t worry about any documentation we just want them to come in and get tested. They
can come into any NYC Gotham Clinic testing site and just say that they don’t have any insurance and
you can’t come in without a mask, and 6 feet distance. We want then to actually stay safe and working
with a lot of businesses telling them to come in and even without insurance we’re ready to provide them

Pg. 2
with a Primary Care Doctor for everybody that walks in, we just want the community to be safe.

CHAIRMAN AND DISTRICT MANAGER’S REPORT
PUBLIC HEARING

The District Manager said that the item tonight was reviewed by the Economic Development-Land
Use & Housing Committee of the Board earlier this month. So after the Board received notification from
City under the purview under the New York City Charter that the Board deals with items related to Land
Use specifically as it relates to city owned property. This particular property has come before the Board
for the second time the first time as I said was in the Committee meeting. The development met with the
Committee and there was a vigorous discussion related to the project after that meeting and receiving
documents from City Planning the Board will move on as prescribed in the City Charter we will have this
Public Hearing that will open shortly.

The presenters will be able to present the item as they did at the Committee level. After that particular
time the floor will be opened by the Chair of the Economic Development-Land Use & Housing
Committee for questions. After that discussion the Public Hearing will be closed. The outcome from this
process will be sent down to the Borough President’s Office who will then have a hearing on the item
under the city’s ULURP process for review. So this is the first step in the process and it starts with us and
it’s a very important item. Everyone needs to realize that all the Land Use items that come before our
Community Board are different from the ones that come from a lot of Community Boards particularly
because our Board used to have a lot of public land we do not have anymore our last large parcel in the
Melrose Common area and south of that area have now been disposed of and you see a lot of them have
been developed. The last one is a property off of Brook Avenue so what you have now are small sites
that the city is putting forth under various programs. The item has been reviewed by the Department of
City Planning and initially reviewed by HPD that’s the disposition of property.

Some of you went through this process last week at the Borough President’s Office. This is a very
important process because when you dispose of land it’s disposed permanently and after you make a
decision on that land every decision that you make also reflects on the community long term long after
we’ve stopped being engaged in this process. So this is very important and everyone has to make sure
that they ask appropriate questions and there is not a question that you cannot ask the Development Team.
This Board and the community is going to be impacted by this project. So I’m now going to turn it over
to the Chair of the Economic Development-Land Use & Housing Committee.

Ms. Arline Parks Chairperson Economic Development-Land Use & Housing said that | will
begin by giving a report on the project and jlust for a point of clarification this is privately owned not city

Pg. 3

Owned that is being funded by tax payer dollars from HPD under the Ella program and low income tax
credits. So to start we had just one project that was presented to the Board and a Mr. Frank St. Jacques
from the law firm of Akerman LLP presented this project on behalf of the lot owner Nisan Cohen under
the name of his corporate entity First Concord Realty LLC. Now what they’re proposing t do on the lot at
431 Concord Avenue is to redevelop two lots there that requires rezoning. The proposed actions are to
change the zoning from M1-2 to R7 on the lots owned by the proposed Developer, on block 2575 that
consists of lots 15, 16 and 18. The second part of the zoning would be to establish that area as Mandatory
Inclusionary Housing and the development sites are lots 16 and 18 for Mandatory Inclusionary Housing.
Now these actions would allow for the development of an 1 1-story residential building consisting of 92-
units of housing which includes 23 permanently restricted units under the Mandatory Inclusionary
Housing program. The distribution is 16-studios, 42-one-bedrooms, 23-two-bedrooms, 10-three-
bedrooms and 1-unit that would be designated for the Superintendent. The representation was further
made that at least 15 percent of the units would be set aside for formerly homeless. Under this project
they’re funding 29 parking spaces in the rear of the building. There would be no stores on the ground
level of the building and the project is to incorporate the Enterprise Green Communities. The estimated
cost of this project under the ELLA program with low income tax credits is about $40 million dollars.

The Committee after presentation from the Developer and the Law Firm from Frank St. Jacque and after
hearing from the residents testimonies of what their experience has been living in the community next to
the property being owned by the Developer the committee voted not to support the project because they
also failed to provide documents that were required for review by the Committee and still to my
knowledge there wasn’t any real outreach to the residents from a representative of or the Developer
regarding the plans for development of a project of this scale. Most of the housing in that neighborhood
is homeowners the scale of this project is larger than anything in that neighborhood. Then finally what
was really compelling was the representation from neighborhood residents to the applicant really failing
to be a responsible owner and not maintaining the lot there for three years and the other thing that was
compelling is it appears that the City Planning Commission certified that project without it coming to the
Board which really sets a very bad precedent here. It shows how an applicant can go to the city and get
projects approved before they even come before the Community Board. It just sets a very bad precedent.
On the basis of the Developer representations that were made and the community that would be impacted
the Committee is recommending to the Board not to approve or grant the project a Letter of Support.

The District Manager said that the project Development Team for 431 Concord Avenue rezoning
project had the floor.

Mr. Frank St. Jacques said that Joshua Cohen from the Development Team is going to speak briefly
about the project and available to answer questions afterwards.

Mr. Joshua Cohen said that I’m part of the Development Team and here with my father Nisan Cohen
and my brother Nathan Cohen we’re the owners of the proposed land and First Concord Realty LLC. We
are a family immigrant operated and owned small business. My father has been in the real estate business
specifically in the Bronx over the last 35 years. He has been focused and working tirelessly to develop
affordable income housing. He has a proven track record of well-maintained properties really trying to
develop and bring great housing to the Bronx. A little bit about myself I am a first generation American
my father immigrated to America looking for a better life and opportunity. He’s always trying to give

Pg. 4

others the opportunity that he had coming to the States. Again, as mentioned before many of the
neighbors had a few complaints that we would like to address and acknowledge. So, we acquired the site
in 2017 our intentions were to always to build affordable housing. We acknowledge the complaints
raised by the community and the neighbors, we understand the mistakes that we’ve done although we
can’t change the past, we’re ready to move forward and commit to better maintenance, have a better
relationship with our neighbors. We’ve scheduled routine maintenance a fow days a week for somebody
to go by and ensure the site is completely clean. We’ve also heard the concerns of from neighbors and
the Community Board regarding Wavecrest Management you know we’ve heard your concerns and are
interested in working with you to get someone that everyone is happy with and try to find someone that
works for everybody. I’m going to pass it off to Frank now to deliver the presentation and look forward
to hearing your feedback.

Mr. Frank St. Jacques said that I’m going to share my screen and walk you through the details of the
project. Madam Chair thank you for your introduction. This is a longer presentation then what we
provided to the Committee last week. I will provide the details and again will be happy to answer any
questions. In addition to the owners the Cohen’s we’re also joined by the project Architect and our
Affordable Housing Consultant. So, for more specific questions the Project Team is here to answer those.

So, we’re here to present an application for two actions a Zoning Map Amendment ending an existing
M1-2 district to an R7 district into the Zoning Tax Amendment an Inclusionary Housing Program known
as MIH in this rezoning area. The Zoning Map and Tax Amendment for the rezoning of an underutilized
site 11-story 100 percent affordable residential building with 92 units. Under MIH approximately 23 of
these units will be permanently income restricted. The rezoning area is located at the end of an M1-2
shown on the Zoning Map. The rezoning area is outside the Port Morris Industrial Zone which ends at
East 144"" Street rezoning area. The adjacent zoning district is an R7-1 district where residential use is
permitted, the rear 10 ft. portion of the site is within the R7-1 district. Because the district boundary runs
through the center of the block in contrast to the M1-2 district the R7-1 district is a medium residential
that would allow up to a 14-story building. Land use in the surrounding area on this map yellow
represents residential plus community facility, gray is vacant land and purple is industrial. Here is an
aerial view of the site area the rezoning area is shaded in red located again at the corner of Concord
Avenue East 145"" Street. You can see St. Mary’s Park on the left side of the slide, the 6 train is just a
few blocks away on 143"" and Southern Blvd. The rezoning area consists of the north-eastern portion of
the block, this is block 2578 it contains three tax lots, that’s part of lot 15 on the corner 441 Concord
Avenue, lot 16 which is 439 Concord Avenue, and lot 18 at the southern end that’s 431 Concord Avenue.
There are vacant buildings on lot 16, lot 18 has been unimproved and vacant for about 30 years. The
development site consists of lots 16 and 18 which is owned by the applicant where the proposed
development would be located. It’s about 13,700 sq. ft. and has 125 ft. of Concord Avenue and the site is
about 110 ft. deep and 10 ft. of the site is within that R7 district. The proposed rezoning is the red shaded
portion of the zoning map and the rezoning facilitates the development of an 11-story residential building
with the quality housing regulations with approximately 92 units.

The proposed development consists of 76 thousand feet of floor area, it rises to 11-floors after a setback
along the 9-story base and approximately a 42 ft. yard is provided. The first floor of the building will
contain the residential lobby and a mechanical room. As it’s been proposed it will contain 29 off street
accessory parking spaces. There were further concerns from the community of not wanting that parking
and we’re speaking with the Architect with potential removing those spaces which would probably make
HPD more amenable to this application, so we’re looking into that. The proposed rezoning would allow

Pg. 5

for the production of new housing in Community District 1 which is currently not permitted at the site an
M1-2 district. The proposed zoning change from an M1-2 district to an R7 residential district is great
because it’s located right next to the R7-1 zoning district which has comparable bulk provision and also
includes public transportation subway and bus service. Two of the features are that the project would
have sustainability features as part of Enterprise Green Communities project and the unit distribution is
about 18 percent studios, 46 percent one-bedrooms, 25 percent two-bedrooms and 11 percent three-
bedrooms accommodating families as well as having studios and one-bedrooms.

The applicant wants to develop the building with HPD’s ELLA program which requires 80 percent of the
units at below 80 percent AMI, 15 percent set aside for formerly homeless. One thing to note is that MIH
the Mandatory Inclusionary Housing area will be mapped in the rezoning area formerly affordable units
must be increased by 15 percent, so that’s an increase of 14 units to be permanently affordable from 23 to
37. A note that the median household income in district 1 in 2018 was just over $26,000 60 percent less
than the citywide median household income which is about $65,000. The poverty rate in Community
District was about 28 percent in 2018 compared to 17 percent citywide. The overall rental vacancy rate
in Community District 1 was 1.6 percent. Finally, according to the Census Bureau about 50 percent of
households in Bronx District Ispend more than 35 percent or more of their income on rent which is 44.2
percent citywide. Showing here a 2020 New York area AMI Chart and New York City affordable
monthly rents which would be provided in this 100 percent affordable development.

As I mentioned the applicant is working with HPD to develop the building under the ELLA term sheet. Its
different facade materials including color brick to create visual and breakup the massing. Outdoor space
will be provided with balconies and there’s a 25 sq. ft roof recreation area. I’m just going to quickly run
through the floor plan for the building. The site plan shows the building being built along the lot line on
Concord Avenue and then above the 9th floor the building is setback before rising to the 11-story height
and the 42 ft. rear yard. The ground floor contains the residential lobby, building mechanical room,
bicycle parking and two passenger elevators and accessory parking and as I mentioned the Development
Team is working with the Architect and with HPD on that parking issue to decrease or eliminate that
parking. So the floor plan for the 2‘ through 9"" floors and the unit mix with studios, 1, 2 and 3 bedrooms
on each floor and similarly the floor plans for the 10 and 11"" floors shows the unit mix on these floors
and finally the roof would contain 25 ft. landscaped recreation area. I started to mention the back of the
building would contain sustainability features complying with the city regarding green roofs, carbon
reduction and efficiency and all building requirements with respect to building efficiency would be met.
The building would also comply with the Enterprise Green Communities. That’s the conclusion of the
presentation and as I mentioned a number of the Project Team are here and happy to answer any
questions.

Mr. Ted Weinstein HPD said that this Development Team only recently contacted HPD seeking the
financing under our ELLA Program. They choose to work through City Planning to prepare their
ULURP Application. So we can’t say that HPD supports the project because the review particularly of
the underwriting just started. In fact I think just this afternoon they forwarded some comments to the
team and that’s common with a lot of back and forth. So it shouldn’t be said that HPD has approved this
project because it’s just so early in the process.

The Board Members, Elected Official and neighborhood residents asked questions, voiced concerns
and issues related to the site.

Mr. Cedric L. Loftin District Manager said that related to the ULUP project 431 Concord Avenue

BOROUGH PRESIDENT
CEDRIC L. LOFTIN
BETTY BRYANT-BROWN FULL BOARD MEETING DISTRICT MANAGER
CHAIRPERSON MINUTES

October 30, 2019

The Chairperson Ms. Betty Bryant-Brown commenced the meeting with a prayer.

Councilmember Rafael Salamanca said that first I just want to send my regards to Community
Board 1 and just talk about some other stuff that we’re working at in City Hall. The last time I was here I
was asked about the jail plan don’t know if you followed it and just to give you arecap. | am I favor of
closing down Riker’s. When the Commission put out a report to close out Riker’s the plan was that in
order to close down Riker’s we have to open up four borough based jails and every borough was going to
get a jail except for Staten Island. But what separated the Bronx from Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn
was that the Littman recommended when you open up these new jails they should be attached to the
courthouse. What separated us was that Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn already had jails attached to
the courthouse the borough of the Bronx did not have jails attached to the courthouse and that was my
opposition. If we’re going to shut down Riker’s then they should have opened up the jail built the jail on
161% Street behind the courthouse and followed the recommendations of the Littman Commission. That
did not happen for whatever reasons there were the alternative site that the administration chose was the
tow pound and I came in opposition. I told you that I was going to oppose it and when time to vote I
voted no for the jail. I just wanted to let you know that I kept my word. It did pass but I thought that it
was important that you know what I did and how I voted in City Hall and I just wanted you to know that I
stood up for you guys.

Just to talk about some of the work that we’re doing today in city Hall we voted on a few bills that follow
the waste industry the private sanitation of the waste industry. There are some regulations what happens
now is that you have carters stationed out of the Bronx and they’re picking up garbage in all five
boroughs including Staten Island. Individuals who are doing hundreds of stops you know the amount of
mileage in driving back and forth to get to Staten Island. The pollutants that these trucks are putting in
the air | suffer from asthma and I walk around with my asthma pump. So what we did at City Hall today
we voted on a bill that would be zoned designations for private sanitations. They’re going to put out bids
and there’s going to be carriers that are going to win those bids to pick up the garbage in particular
locations. So that may take about a year to implement and we voted on that today at City Hall.

Finally, on November 21* I’m going to have a neighborhood Pop-Up-Court in my district office. So if
you’re a homeowner with tickets because you have garbage in front of your house and they give you a
summons for it or if you’re a business owner and you’ve got some summons and you just haven’t had the
opportunity to fight that. on November 215 from 9 to 4 there’s going to be a Pop-Up-Court in my district
office where there will be a Judge there and employees there to help you navigate and the opportunity for
you to plead your case and get rid of these tickets. I will make sure that Cedric gets the flyer.

Questions and Comments

Pg. 2

State Senator Luis Sepulveda said that although the construction of the jail is not directly in my
Jurisdiction I’m Statewide elected not Citywide and Riker’s is a City official issue. I had a different
perspective from the very beginning I thought that it made no sense to close Riker’s I think we should
have rebuilt Riker’s retrofit the cells. I’m the Chairman for the Prison’s Committee for the entire State of
New York, I oversee all the prisons and all the jails through legislation and through my Chairmanship. I
thought we should spend the money building humane cells in Riker’s not from this bringing it from area
to area. In bringing into this area here I too agree that it should have been by the courthouse it would
make more sense with transportation and so forth. But there were some logistical problems with footage
that the city claimed was the reason why they couldn’t build right there by the school plus they got a lot
of resistance from Concourse Village and the surrounding areas. Just like most things not in my
backyard. But the reality is and I thought it was shortsighted when we’re going to spend whatever money
we’re going to spend building to do retrofitting and doing a better job. Our problem is our whole
correctional system the prisons upstate are inhumane the young men and women that go there basically
are not getting the level of education they should, are not getting treatment about 30 to 40 percent
incarcerated are suffering from mental illness. So our prisons have become a warehouse for people that
suffer from mental illness.

The District Manager asked the Chairperson Ms. Betty Bryant-Brown to commence the meeting with
a prayer.

The District Manager said that we will now move over to the Public Session.

PUBLIC SESSION

ROOM TO GROW

Ms. Akilah King Executive Director Room to Grow said that I’m excited to talk about opening up
a second site around the corner on 147"" Street. So Room to Grow we’ve been around for 20 years and
work with families that have young children ages through to 3. Families start in our program when Mom
is pregnant and they come and visit with one of our Clinicians which is essentially a Social Worker but
we don’t like that term. They stay with the same Clinician for 3 years coming by and we talk about
parenting everything from routines and feeding to making sure that the children are hitting they’re
developmental milestones and it’s also a therapeutic session for parents. So we talk about other things
that are going on in the home, how can we help alleviate any of their stress. We make referrals to other
not only organizations but we have a Dentist in our network that we send our families it’s a whole slew
of services that we work with our families to make sure that Mom, Dad or whoever the co-parent is and
child are healthy and getting the support they need.

What makes Room to Grow really special beyond this one-on-one therapeutic clinic our sites have an in-
house baby boutique. So after we kind of talk about what’s going on with the family we step into the
Boutique and parents take home books, toys, clothing for the baby to keep and this is at every 3 month
visit. We really feel that this is offsetting material hardship but it’s more than that parents can go home
knowing that their baby or toddler is set for the next 3 months so they can put money towards other things
like bills and it just alleviates the stress around making sure that your child has everything that you need.
Also for us we use it as another opportunity to continue talking about development we do a lot of
coaching around reading, early literacy and just what it means to play and how it stimulates the brain for
the child.

Pg. 2

A year ago we were planning on opening up a site around the corner for 25 hundred sq. ft. and that would
allow for 750 new families to be a part of our program. Just a couple of weeks ago I made the decision
that we’re not only going to do that we’re going to open up a 10 thousand sq. ft. space in the Bronx
around the corner and I’m moving Room to Grow flagship location here over the course of the next
couple of years. We looking to partner with this community not just to help the families but to create
community space that’s here to stay. We are starting to enroll families now.

THE MISSION CONTINUES

Mr. David Rosas said that the Mission Continues is a non-profit organization geared towards veterans
and helping in their transition out of the military and preparing them to be servants or leaders within our
communities. So last week we actually did a project here in Mott Haven and we were working with City
Foundation and the Center for Court Interventions and they‘re actually working with the Mayor’s Action
Plan in the NYCHA Housing. So we’ve helped rehabilitate one of the gardens at that location and we
have 2 more gardens that we will be rehabilitating probably in the coming months.

But I came here just to kind of give you guys some information on some of the programs that Mission
Continues has for veterans. One of them is called the Service Commission Corp. basically that is a type
of fellowship that gets veterans together helping them again with their transition from military service and
also helping them to learn things geared towards helping the community and being more civic minded
engaging in the community. So that program was revamped from the one I went through last year I
actually went through a fellowship with them and it was really great. So going forward one of the other
programs is they’re Service Platoons and that’s where we had gone out as I mentioned to do that garden.
As a member specifically of the Bronx Platoon I’m trying to get the word out about our organization for
veterans and also for other organizations that we can possibly partner with to see where we can help out
in the community in regards to service projects such as helping to rebuild gardens and things of that
nature. So it’s a lot of work that we’ve done I’m actually a volunteer so as I mentioned I did the
fellowship last year and going forward I’m trying to help launch the Bronx Platoon because in the past we
haven’t had as much participation as we'd like so that’s why I’m coming to a lot of these Community
Board Meetings to say hay we’re here for a resource that the community can use and call upon to help
out. We have a growing membership and do a lot of work in other communities in other parts of the city.

The District Manager said that today I received a letter from the Borough Presidents Office on new
appointments to the Board and if I call your name and you’re here please stand. The persons that have
been appointed were informed through a letter from the Borough President they are not here for the first
meeting and so will be marked as absent.

CHAIRMAN AND DISTRICT MANAGER’S REPORT

The District Manager introduced Mr. David Matthew Beller from the U.S. Census Bureau who would
be making a presentation.

Mr. David Matthew Beller Partnership Specialist said that I will give you a brief overview of who
I am and sort of give you what the goals are for this presentation. My job is to really go out to the
community and for one spread the importance of the Census what it means for community members and
what it means to New York City as a whole. Then the second part of my job is to try to build as many
partnerships with organizations, business leaders, and critical stakeholders in the community that’s
considered to be a trusted voice and obviously the Community Board in this area is one of the trusted
voices. So the presentation has 3 focuses one is the importance of the Census and what it means for you
on the ground, the second part is going to be about the jobs that we offer and the wages that we provide
and then the last part of the presentation will be we’re trying to make the case to the Board that you can
take an active role to ensure a complete and accurate account so you as a local group with the support of
the Census and figure out the best ways to reach out to your community to spread the message and make
sure that you’re well represented.

Basically what is the Census so according to the Constitution Article 1 Section 2 requires a Census every
10 years and we’ve been doing it since 1790.and the next one coming up is April 2020. I would say the
Census has 3 major impacts the first is portable representation the number of seats that we get in Congress
is the number tied to the count that we get on the Census. The portable representation in Washington that
means your voice being heard how much federal money you get on the local level and really insures that
policies reflect your interest. The other really significant aspect of the census is that we get about $675
billion in General Funds every year from Washington and it can trickle down to the local government. If
we’re not counted and our voice isn’t heard we’re not getting our fair share of money so that’s money for
the MTA for schools, roads money for infrastructure. The last significant role of the Census plays is local
businesses, non-profits and local government use Census data for political planning purposes so if they
want to build a new condominium. a rec center or possibly build a new social service center a lot of times
they will use demographic data to figure out is there a community base to support it. So making sure that
the community is fully represented is critical. The other thing that I’d like to talk about and this has
obviously been in the News a lot is data protection and privacy. So there are a lot of misconceptions and
a lot of myths about what we do with data and where does your data ultimately live. So one of the
handouts was about US Census at a glance which is what we do and probably more important is our
confidentiality policy. I would just say very clearly the data that we collect is never about the individual
we collect what we call Personally Identifying Data all the data that we collect is about groups. We start
at the Federal level will go down to the State level go down to the county, municipality, the zip codes but
the lowest level we collect is on what we call Census Track and that’s anywhere from 2 thousand to 10
thousand people depending on the size of an Urban Area for instance Coop City could have multiple
Census Tracks and a large housing development near here could be its own Census Track. But the simple
point is that we don’t go below that level because we don’t want anything personally identifying. We

Pg. 4

don’t want to release information about individuals we don’t want to release information about their
households all is done at the group level.

I think that’s very important to state publicly is that the data is protected from unlawful disclosure that
means all the data that we collect anything that we don’t release the public we don’t release to anyone
else. So if any State or local government even if a private individual or citizen calls asking for
information on household the answer would be no that information cannot be released and if a Census
Bureau does there are 2 penalties one it’s a $250 thousand dollar fine and up to 5 years in prison this
information is protected up to 72 years. So it’s really important to let you know that we’re not collecting
information on individuals and by law we cannot release that information about anything that’s personally
identifying to any government, any individual or any organization.

So basically the Census has 4 major parts we have to first figure out where to count people, we have to
motivate and encourage people to respond, we actually have to count the people and we have to release
that information to the public. We’re going to take all the information that we collect and we’re going to
create a master list and this is what we ultimately use to send out. Then ultimately next spring we will
begin to send out our Census Forms and people have the option to do it over the phone we will be able to
do it online for the first time in history and we will have the traditional paper form and we will do that
throughout next spring. If people don’t respond throughout the spring come next summer we will send
the door knockers and saying excuse me and thank you for opening your door we’re here to help you
complete your Census. One thing to be very clear we’re not law enforcement we don’t force our way into
anyone’s house, everyone has the right to close the door in our face we’re a statistical agency that’s trying
to collect data. Then once we collect all the data at the end of 2020 we submit a report to the President
and the report has to be submitted by December 31, 2020 and then throughout the spring we will release
the data publicly. On April 1% we will release it to local and State government and to the public as a
whole. That is really sort of the life cycle of the Census. Right now we’re in the middle of the operation
we’re actually in this community.

So the other thing I wanted to talk about and I clearly heard feedback from the folks in the room about
jobs. So the Census has a significant amount of jobs we’re going to hiring people in the metro area. We
have 2 offices that are local the first one is one Third Avenue and East 151* right opposite of Model’s if
you know that store the second one we just opened on Baychester Avenue right in Coop City. We need to
hire folks to work in those offices and then we need people to work in the field. So in the back of the
room I left some cards it has information on how to apply for a job. But basically we’re looking to hire
people to run offices to be Office Managers to be HR Managers our jobs start at $20 dollars an hour if
you want to work in the field it’s $25 an hour, if you have management experience it can be in retail or
office administration maybe you ran your own business our office management jobs start at $31.50, and if
you want to run an entire office you make $42.50 an hour. These are full time jobs 40 hours a week with
overtime eligible. The management jobs come with full federal benefits, healthcare, pension, insurance
the full federal package. The Census taker jobs and the office administrator jobs do not come with
benefits but they can be full time some people work 40 hours but generally regarded as seasonal part time
workers. So those are the opportunities it’s very simple to apply for these jobs you go onto

2020 census/jobs and its one application for every open job. You don’t have to come in for an interview
will interview you on the phone and if you make it through that process you’ll go through a background
check. The other thing we have is specialized opportunities so we’re hiring for 3 special positions in the
Bronx and the first position we need a West African Outreach Specialist someone that has ties to West
African organizations hopefully speaks one or more West African languages, we need an African
American Outreach Specialist someone with ties to African American organizations and has specific
experience working with that community and then the third position is a Caribbean Outreach Specialist

Pg.5

and we’re looking for people that either have ties to the indo or Afro Caribbean community and if you
have both even better. So if anyone knows a candidate with experience in any of those communities and
perhaps speaks Spanish please let me know these jobs start at $50 thousand dollars with full benefits.

So you can work not only as a partner but you can actually take a hands on roll so we have something
called the Complete Count Committee. This is when a group of trusted voices concerned citizens get
together and they do outreach strategies they do events anything that they feel is necessary to make sure
that people are counted in the Census. We what we do as Census employees is support you it’s your
show to run. We support you by bringing staff to your events, we can brainstorm and we can give you
materials. This is an under counted area and last time in this area a third of the people in this community
did not respond to the Census and that means it’s less monies for schools, roads, and everything.

Questions and Comments

The Chairperson called for a motion on the Chairman and District Manager’s Report.
Motion made to approve the Chairman and District Manager’s Report as presented. Motion duly
seconded. Motion called and passed.

ELECTED OFFICIALS REPORTS

The representative for Assemblyman Michael Blake said that I’m just here to say that there’s a lot
of really good work that happened this session in Albany related to charitable bail reform, education
money that got allocated in the budget fiscal year 19 through 20 and recently there have been a lot of
strides made in rent regulation laws. So I just here to talk briefly about some highlights. There has been
a repeal of high rent vacancy regulation so this means that they’re use to be statutes that would allow for
rent controlled units to be deregulated and put up to market value, there has now been a bill passed that if
the rent reaches 2,700 hundred dollars in New York City they can’t be deregulated. Another example
there have been reforms on the owner use exception which means that tenants can be provided with a
cause of action if they’re evicted on the basis of a landlord making a fraudulent claim of the intended use
of their household. Additionally there is stabilizing of apartments renting to non-profits, so if a non-profit
is renting a unit intended for an individual at the risk of becoming homeless that unit has to remain
stabilized only the landlord can raise that unit to market value. One last example there’s been an
expansion of eligibility for coverage for every county in New York State for ETPA and removing
geographic limitations, that means if you are in a Municipality that has 5 percent or less of their rental
vacancy value they can opt into rent stabilize that means that too many people in that municipality are not
getting affordable units. If you have concerns about housing, education, minority owned business
enterprises, Mitchell Lama those are just a few of his focuses he’s actually still in Albany in session as we
speak. So he’s still fighting the good fight for all of you. There were a few key points that we were
fighting for in Albany this session one being Riker’s, two being Minority and Women owned businesses,
and three the Specialized High School examination discussion, So a lot of people have mixed opinions
about the value or the where with all of the Specialize High School admission. If you have any thoughts
or suggestions concerning those areas feel free to let me know.

CHAIRPERSON

FULL BOARD MEETING
MINUTES
May 23, 2019

THE MAYORS OFFICE OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND THE NEW YORK CITY
DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTION

The District Manager stated that there was to be a Public Hearing on the Borough Based Jail Proposal
and a presentation on the item by the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice and the New York City
Department of Corrections.

Ms. Arline Parks Chairperson of the Economic Development-Land Use & Housing
Committee said that we will start the Agenda tonight by having representatives from the Mayor’s Office
present their plan for Mott Haven followed by the open session where speaker can come up and present
their views on what is being presented tonight and we’re asking everyone to be mindful that we have a
number of speakers tonight and we’ve got to allow everyone to make their point and let’s make sure that
we’re respectful tonight in allowing everyone to make their position no matter what it is. We thank
everybody for coming out tonight. That said can we have everyone from the Mayor’s Office state their
names and who they are.

The District Manager requested for the Chairperson Ms. Betty Bryant-Brown to open the meeting
with a prayer.

The District Manager stated that if anyone wanted to speak that the Speakers List would be in
the back of the auditorium.

Mr. Jordan Stockdale Deputy Director of close Riker’s of the Mayor’s Office of Criminal
Justice said that when we talk about close Riker’s we first like to give the context in terms of the
dropping jail population. In 1991 the jail population was around 22 thousand today it’s about 75 hundred.

This massive decline of jail population was from hard working communities, changes in policies and
investment in alternative programs to incarceration. As you see the jail population dropped 30 percent


Pg. 2

since the Mayor took office. We believe that the population will reach 4 thousand which is different from
when we announced it first we thought the population would go down to 5 thousand but due to recent
changes at the State level bail reform, speedy trials we discovered we believe the population will go down
to 4 thousand due to a lot of hardworking people in this room.

When we talk about closing Riker’s Island we talk about the moral imperative and I think everyone
understands about the moral imperative of closing Riker’s. Riker’s was designed in a different era when
the point of jail was to punish with punition with retribution it was not to rehabilitate or reengage
individuals it was not with the understanding that the vast majority of people in jail are pre-trail thus
innocent under the law. Visiting loved ones at Riker’s Island is very difficult it takes all day to get there
and it reduces the amount of people who visit their loved ones. We know a strong bond between
community members is right, two it reduces the recidivism and so from a justice and safety standpoint it’s
the right thing to have smaller facilities in a borough as opposed to on an island. Riker’s Island is located
far away from the courthouses and the distance from the courthouse from the jail sometimes leads to case
delays where people don’t arrive to court on time because of New York City congestion and then they
have to wait in Riker’s until their next court date which could be days away. This could be solved
through having a borough based plan where the jails are closer to facilities. Again, Riker’s was designed
in a different era new facilities can be designed to be safer to have targeted programming and to
ultimately treat people better and reduce recidivism.

When we talk about the goals for the new smaller borough based jail system it’s fair, safer and more
efficient. Fair meaning it’s designed to encourage social outcomes, educational outcome, health
outcomes and people would be closer to their families and communities and provide better access to
social services there would be continual support upon release and ultimately fewer families would be
impacted by the Justice System. This plan would reduce the bed capacity by over two-thirds this is a
massive de-carceration plan we believe it’s one of the largest in the history of US Cities. We would close
outdated facilities that had poor lines of sights and have newer ones that are safer and we’d provide
programming. The system would be more efficient we'd streamline transfers between the courthouse
and the facility that would improve access to Attorneys and social services.

When we talk about how this plan was developed to close Riker’s the call to close Riker’s came from the
people. The people came out and demanded Riker’s be closed. The plan was also developed in
consultation Justice Taskforce which is comprised of 75 members, advocates, former incarcerated,
academics and a combination of all that. We were advised by the Neighborhood Advisory Council, we
discussed investments in the neighborhood, how to best integrate the facility into the community and how
to use the community space in each of the facilities and we met with local Councilmembers with the
Board of Corrections with all other actors in the Criminal Justice system.

We plan to build housing for 4 thousand people when we originally announced this plan is was for 5
thousand people. We believe that it would take about 46 hundred beds for 15 percent inefficiency rate.
Again, right now we have capacity for about 14 thousand beds in operating and non-operating facilities
this is more than a two-third reduction in the bed capacity. We currently have 11 operating jails in New
York City at the end of this plan there would be 4 jails. Each of the 4 boroughs would have 1 facility as
part of this plan the City would close the barge which is the boat in the Bronx.

So again this plan is a massive de-carceration effort it’s to insure that the fewer people that are in facilities
are in better facilities more humane facilities that are designed to improve outcomes and that is kind of the
basis of the plan.

Pg.3

The site selection criteria is one close to the courthouse closer than Riker’s, that it’s city owned property,
that it’s transit accessible that there is sufficient site area for our programming goals that we have very
small housing units and that we have tailored programming within those housing units. The site locations
include 125 Worth Street in Manhattan, 275 Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, in Kew Gardens in Queens
Second Avenue, in the Bronx at the current NYPD Tow Pound which is 745 East 141 Street.

This is the program summary when we imagined the facilities would have 1 thousand people total, we
now imagine that it would be 4 thousand people total with 46 hundred beds so the proposed number now
is 1, 150 beds. So we are proposing to replace the current NYPD Tow Pound with a new facility that
would have support services, potentially retail and community facility space. The facility would have
1.437 beds and a maximum height of 245 ft. 575 below grade accessory parking spaces. This is a vignette
of the potentially facility on the ground floor where community space could be located. To facilitate this
proposed project we’re seeking both system wide actions and site specific actions, system wide we are
seeking a site selection for the boroughs comprised of the 4 proposed sites we’re also seeking a text
amendment to create a borough based jail special permit that would allow modifications to zoning
regulations and facilitate the development of the 4 facilities. Specific to the Bronx we are applying for
the borough based jail special permit we are also seeking a zoning map change a zoning text amendment
and disposition of the facility for future mixed use development for affordable housing on the western
portion near Concord Avenue. What is important to note there is that on the proposed mixed
development the affordable housing would actually face the community the one-third size of the land plot
on the left hand side the facility would face Bruckner Boulevard.

In summary this special permit would allow for the modification of FAR’s, height and setback accessory
parking and loading as well as ground floor uses. As you can see here the plan is to separate the building
from the mixed use development by lowering the permitted height of the jail on the western end of the
facility. The special permit allows for the following ground floor uses, public entrances, retail,
community space, parking and loading and staff entrances. We will be rezoning from an M1-3 to an M1-
4, R7X to facilitate about 235 affordable housing units which would be on one-third of the land plot and
there would also be 31 thousand sq. ft. of community space within the facility.

Here we have the timeline we’d close Riker’s and the new units would be built by 2026. We are still in
the Master Plan approval stage. If this project is to be approved we would then issue a Request for
Proposals and the team approved would then demolish the existing facility and begin the design building
phase which will go to 2026. We originally said it would be 2027 but we believe it would be faster now
because of the reduction in the population and a reduction in the overall size of the actual facilities.

The District Manager said that we are now going to move over to the next phase of the public hearing
and requested if there were any Elected Officials that would like to provide commentary on the proposed
Bronx borough based jail before we move on to the speaker sheet list.

Assemblyman Michael Blake and individuals that had requested to speak made comments
and voiced concerns related to the proposed Borough Based Jail.

Pg. 4

The Board voted not to approve the proposed siting of the jail at Concord Avenue East
141* Street.

The Chairperson called for a motion to adjourn.
Motion made to adjourn. Motion duly seconded. Motion called and passed.

BOROUGH PRESIDENT
CEDRIC L. LOFTIN
GEORGE L. RODRIQUEZ FULL BOARD MEETING DISTRICT MANAGER
CHAIRPERSON MINUTES

March 28, 2019

Mr. Cedric L. Loftin, District Manager asked Ms. Betty Bryant-Brown to commence the meeting
with a prayer.

PUBLIC SESSION
BIKE NEW YORK

Ms. Sharon Pope said that I’m here to talk to you about Bike New York’s free after-school summer
camp program. These programs are established after-school as well as established summer camp. What
does that mean if your organization has an after-school program or a summer camp program contact us
will give you two hours or more of free programming for youth who are interested in learning how to ride
a bike. We also address the challenges of learning how to ride a bike and provide free bikes, free helmets,
and free safety vests for use during the class we also provide licensed Safety Instructors. I’m going to
pass around these flyers that are only for existing after-school or summer camps and we need your help to
publicize these programs. You can contact the Director of Youth Programs from this flyer if you’re
interested please contact us.

Now separately a lot of you may not have heard of Bike New York however you have heard of the Five
Borough Bike Tour, that’s us. We have 32 thousand people the first Sunday in May to cover all five
boroughs comprising 40 miles is the Five Borough Bike Tour. It would be totally wonderful if we could
have some cheer squads some folks who are out there encouraging the cyclists as they come through the
Bronx. So if you’re interested or know of some step groups or other types of cheer squads let me know I
can give you my business card and we can contact them to find out they’re availability.

Councilmember Rafael Salamanca said good evening everyone so I just have a few
announcements that I want to make. We’ve started Participatory Budgeting as you may know
every Councilperson has the option to participate in that program where we take a million dollars
from the Capital dollars allocated to every Councilmember and we allow the community to tell
us how to spend that million dollars. For the last couple of months we’ve been going around to
different parts of the neighborhood asking the constituents people in the community about ideas
of how they would like to spend a million of Capital dollars. Remember Capital dollars are
things that are brick and mortar things you cannot move in making improvements to schools,
benches, bus stops, parks things of that nature. The beauty about this is that constituents kids
that live in the neighborhood kids as young as 11 years old. So we’ve compiled all the requests

Pg. 2

there’s about 7 requests that I got from my district and we’re voting on it this week. The voting
starts on Saturday and it ends next Sunday but because you guys will be meeting at the end of
next month will handout these ballots and make an exception so you guys can vote. But I’m
really excited about this because again this is an opportunity for you the constituents to decide
how we can spend a million dollars. May 8"" along with the American Cancer Foundation I am
hosting an early detection of Breast Cancer event where we’re going to have a mammogram van
parked in front of my District Office it’s going to be from 9 to 4:30. Those individuals that have
insurance or don’t have insurance you’re more than welcome to come regardless of your
immigration status you will be serviced. For those individuals that have an appointment with
your Tech months down the line and you want something much sooner they will perform the
exam and they will send your results to your Primary Care Doctor. So it’s just something free
that we’re doing.

Councilmember Diana Ayala said good evening everyone. There has been a lot of conversations in
the last few months about the Mott Haven Jail Proposal and I know that there were a lot of questions at
the last meeting so I’m here if you have questions for me.

Questions and Comments

The Councilmember explained her reasons for supporting the jail being placed in the Mott Haven section
of her district.

Mr. Josh Cortes Mayor’s Office answered questions related to the Mayor’s Jail Proposal.

Mr. Justin Santana the Bronx Borough President’s Office said that I want to give the Borough
President’s perspective on everything that’s going on right now. On Sunday we did hold a rally at City
Hall. Basically where we are on this is that there is a better location, everyone knows there’s a better
location and we don’t understand why people are arguing against that point but apparently that’s the
message they want to be telling to you. From the Borough President’s Office we know there’s a better
location we’re fighting to make sure that there’s not an issue and we’ve already had a conversation with
the State, the State said that they would turn over that land so we could build a jail there. On top of that
the Borough President said that there was no consultation with his office from the City and not even any
consultation from Melissa Mark-Viverito who was talking about all of this. We have to understand the
struggle of these human beings the things that happen at Riker’s are not just okay what the Borough
President is fighting for is just to make sure that when we build a new jail we’re building it in the right
place and doing it in the right way so a repeat of what has happened on Riker’s doesn’t happen all over
again. So that is the Borough President’s position on this and we will continue to be engaged and be
present with all the meetings coming up. Anything that you guys want us to know we’re always here for
you and if you have any questions as to where we stand I’m here until the end of the meeting.

CHAIRMAN AND DISTRICT MANAGER’S REPORT

The District Manager said that related to tonight’s report we have a Public Hearing before us based on
a certification that has happened for us to act on a ULURP item within a 60 day period, the period began
on March the 6"" and must be completed by May the 6"" of this year. This item came before the Economic
Development-Land Use & Housing Committee a presentation was made by individuals from HPD and
also the Development Team. That item was passed out of Committee this month. Now we’re going to
have a Public Hearing as is necessary under the City Charter I will read the application number and notice
of certification.

PUBLIC HEARING OPENED

The District Manager said that we will move forward with the entities first we will start with HPD
providing a brief overview related to the history of this project and then move on to the presentation itself
by the Development Team.

Mr. Ted Weinstein Director of Bronx Planning HPD said that tonight we have a ULURP
presentation that’s the public review procedure that you have to go through for various reasons we’ve
done this in front of you many, many, many times. I'll just tell you a little bit about the background about
the site and some of the history. The Development Team will give you some more details briefly.

This is a site at the corner of Courtlandt Avenue and East 157"" Street that’s within the Melrose Commons
Urban Renewal area which has been an area that has been tremendously developed. That Urban Renewal
area is split roughly between your district, district 1 and district 3 but in total approximately 35 hundred
apartments, newly built apartments have come on board since the first new construction in 2000. So this
is one of the few vacant remaining city owned Urban Renewal sites that are in Melrose Commons. For
the most part when we have city owned land so we do a competitive process for that land like a Request
for Proposals that’s what we did here a few years ago but typically in this case there were MWBE’s
because we wanted to try and somewhat start to expand the universe of Development Teams that come in
to us and get financing from us. As I think you know when its city owned land we sell that land to the
Developer for a nominal amount because we want the money to go into the building. We did that RFP
got some proposals we reviewed them, they’re reviewed by our finance people, our Architects, our
planning people and then we selected a team that we think came up with a good proposal. It’s a fairly

Pg. 4

small site and they’ Il explain that it’s only going to be 20 units. We’re pleased that the few remaining lots
can be developed for affordable housing. It’s through ULURP and there are three actions the city needs
the authority to dispose of the land and also to designate as an Urban Development Action Area UDAP
which allows it to get certain tax benefits and certain necessary loan as well. The Urban Renewal Plan
had some height restrictions on certain blocks for the most part the north-south avenues like Melrose
Avenue like Third Avenue was rezoned back in the 1990’s when the Urban Renewal Plan was adopted
most of the side streets had height restrictions we found almost immediately after that it did not make
much sense so there is a section in the Urban Renewal Plan for the larger zoned areas the height
restriction is very different from what zoning is now but on the side streets where it says R7 is limited to
only 45 ft. that just isn’t practical at this point at all. So there is a section in the Urban Renewal Plan that
allows for an exemption from that requirement and so what we’re proposing to do is to add this particular
site to that exemption so that what gets built there will be as per zoning. So those are the actions you will
be voting on and at this point I turn it over to Randall Powell and his Development Team.

Mr. Randall Powell Principal said that we’re looking to develop a 7-story 20-unit building with
community facility space as well as commercial retail space on the first floor. It is located on the corner
of Courtlandt Avenue and East 157"" Street. It’s actually 2 city owned lots that are owned by the City of
New York I believe it’s actually an infill site. Also in surrounding area are NYCHA buildings and a
school in the area to the left of the site and some other residential housing complexes in the area.

Just to briefly give you guys a layout in the package that I provided on page 6 is what the design of the
building will look like represented by this rendering. We have an entrance for the retail space,
community facility space as well as for the building. We’re also proposing a community area that will
house a laundry facility as well as an open space and solar panels. The design of the building will have
various size units we’re targeting a family building so there will be one, two and three bedroom units
affordable to households between 30 to 80 percent AMI. In terms of other amenities we also have a bike
storage facility this building will have an elevator within the community facility space there will also be
an elevator that can be used for those eventual occupants. As we move through the last couple of pages
you’ll see some other renderings. On page 15 it will give you the elevations of the building. I will let the
co-development team speak about the design issues that we have. Again that’s pretty much the project
and we’re looking to kicking this off. We’re really happy about this and look forward to you guys
supporting our application.

OCV Architects representative said that we’ve been working together in the Bronx for over the last 7
years and have been for 35 years doing affordable housing. What we’ve presented here is a very nice
package of a mixed use building that has a corner store it’s going to have a community facility space that
may be a daycare a medical facility that’s still to be determined. Then upstairs the energy efficient
apartments that are going to be mostly two-bedrooms, three’s and a couple of one-bedroom family units.
What we’re trying to do is provide a variety of amenities for the community in terms of retail, in terms of
community facility, family homes that are affordable to the folks. The specifics on the design we’re
going to have a very high efficient building in terms of energy use we’re going to have all electric heat
pumps and we’re going to use high efficiency lighting. So we’re trying to make something that is in line
with the movement towards a little architecture in the community.

Questions and Comments

Pg. 5

The District Manager asked for a roll call vote.
The roll was called and the vote taken with modifications/conditions made by the Economic
Development-Land Use & Housing Committee and the Board.

The item was passed with modifications/conditions.

PUBLIC HEARING CLOSED

ELECTED OFFICIALS REPORTS

The representative for Comptroller Scott Stringer said that today I have only one announcement
is that demanding that the Charter City Commission to include a Chief Diversity Officer as part of the
proposal to present. What the Chief Diversity Officer will do is basically to create more access to end the
diversity in the city. For example from the 19 billion dollars spent last year only 5 percent of those went
to MWBE?’s that’s something that we have to increase to access for more women, and minorities. So
today I have and iPad with me if you support this I have the petition with me you can just include your
name added there and that will be great.

The District Manager asked for a motion on the Elected Officials Reports.
Motion made to approve the Elected Officials Reports as presented. Motion duly seconded. Motion
called and passed.

Attorney is having a Meet and Greet on Wednesday April 24"" from 6:00 to 8:00 PM. So that you can
come and express any concerns that you may have. Also on April 7"" from 2:00 to 4:00 PM we’re going

FULL BOARD MEETING
MINUTES
February 28, 2019

Mr. Cedric L. Loftin, District Manager asked Ms. Betty Bryant-Brown to commence the meeting
with a prayer.

Ms. Betty Bryant-Brown performed the prayer request.

PUBLIC SESSION

Ms. Emily Allen said that I’m a volunteer with the American Red Cross and this is my colleague Ms.
Adrian and she’s also a volunteer with the American Red Cross. We’re also AmeriCorps volunteers as
well and it’s like the Peace Corp which is international but we’re domestic. Even though we do
international deployments like in Tokyo, and Guam we’re still domestic. We go to all the hurricanes
we’re called hurricane chasers. The purpose of us being here tonight is to sort of brief you we’ve left
some flyers for the Home Safety Campaign and this is where we go out and install free smoke alarms.
We don’t care if you have smoke alarms already in your house. We’re given these smoke alarms from the
Fire Department. The difference with ours is that they have 10-year batteries they have 10-year
guaranteed batteries and they’re all free. We have the smoke alarm combinations and we also have the
single smoke alarms but we have the literature on the table. We also have sign-in sheet on the table if
you’re interested in getting free smoke alarms.

The Red Cross we work from 28 to 32 hours a day what I’m trying to say is that we work overtime.
We’re an organization that never sleeps and work 7-days a week. J usually get calls at 2 and 3 o’clock in
the morning to attend a fire in a building to help with the families that’s what we do. We’re trying to
make homes safer by installing alarms in every home if possible. Last year we installed over | million
alarms this year we’re trying to top it with your help in the community we can do this. Now a lot of
people say I don’t want you in the house because I have some sort of situation, we’re not there to critique
the house we’re just there to say I have helped to make that home safer. Now those who are hearing
impaired Red Cross has special alarms for that we have what we call bed shakers that’s for a person who
can’t hear. We have special alarms for every situation that you could possibly imagine.

Also I want to talk to you briefly about the pillowcase and hands on CPR. Hands only this is not when
you give the mouth to mouth it’s a free course that we offer and anybody can take it. We also have
volunteer opportunities you’re never too young or too old to volunteer. In 3 years I’ll be 70 so therefore I


Pg. 2

work with Red Cross 14 to 16 hours a day. If you want to get a good workout join the Red Cross, I can
guarantee you when you go home you’ll feel good you'll have muscles. I didn’t have muscles but I got
them now. Also we have information on the table a lot of people I find have pets and a lot of people don’t
know what to do with their pets in the case of like an evacuation sometimes they will leave their pets
behind. But we have information on how to take care of a pet in case of an emergency. We have all kind
of information we have on an online store that you can take with you. The hands CPR is very important
now a days and what we want to do is make sure that if you see somebody pass out on the street you can
go and do the hands only and there is a song that we get in our head when doing that CPR can anybody
guess the name of that song Staying Alive that is the beat when you’re doing the hands on CPR. That’s
the beat you want to keep that rhythm going until the Police Department, the Paramedics or whoever
needs to come to takeover you’d be surprised how that works. But again I want everybody to sign up for
those free smoke alarms. Does everybody agree with that, you’re going to agree but are you going to sign
up so before we leave we want to have that page filled? I will go back in and personally put you in our
data base, will make calls to ask you your availability we only come out when you say for us to come out.
We don’t say we got a schedule, no what is your schedule. We come out on weekends we come out on
Saturday’s and Sundays too so like I say we never sleep everybody understand that.

CHAIRMAN AND DISTRICT MANAGER’S REPORT

The District Manager introduced Captain Robert Gallitelli Commander of the 40 Police Precinct and
said that he would be providing a report on what’s happening in the district.

Captain Robert Gallitelli Commander of the 40‘ Police Precinct said that so first of all it’s a
pleasure to be here I see a lot of familiar faces. I’m newly assigned to the 40 I got here about a month ago
prior to coming to the 40 I was in PSA7 which as many of you know covers all the developments in the
40"" and the 42™ Precincts. So I’m very familiar with the area, familiar with a lot of the problems in the
area. Prior to PSA7 I was in charge of the Bronx Gang Squad and before that I was in Bronx Narcotics.
So I’ve been around the Bronx for a while I love it here I had a great time in PSA7 great people great
community and its now an honor for me to kind of move on to the 40"" Precinct and continue to work with
the community in the South Bronx.

Pg.3

We're off to a great start this year we have 142 crimes and that’s compared to 170 last year almost a 17
percent drop off which is a huge decrease. For the year we had three shooting incidents that we’re
currently investigating and like I always say if we had one, one is too many three is certainly too many
but last year at this time we had seven so it’s also a big drop off. What I’ve seen so far in the 40
Precinct I’m happy with the Cops they’re completely plugged in. The NCO Program is really good there
and the NCO’s are really involved so great work being done and we’re collectively looking forward to
working with you guys so thanks for having us. I’m looking forward to working with you guys so thank
you.

Questions and Comments

Councilmember Rafael Salamanca said good evening everyone it’s always great being here. I have
the third largest NYCHA portfolio in New York. I have Jackson Houses, Melrose Houses, Adam Houses,
St. Mary’s a piece of Morrisania Air Rights that’s just on this side of the district then on the other side of
the district you have Watson and I also have some Consolidated that are three-story NYCH developments
throughout my district. I have about 8-milion dollar’s worth of capital need in my NYCHA developments
in my district alone. So what I’ve been doing and I try to be very realistic to my constituents. We
Councilmembers have term limits we only have 2-terms so there’s no way I’m going to be able to bring in
8-million dollars to address all of the needs, but I will try as much as I can to address the most severe
needs of my NYCHA developments. Something that I’ve been very successful at is visiting my
constituent’s apartments what are the issues you have in your NYCH developments or in your apartments
that NYCHA is not addressing and we’ve been very successful at that. So as a result of that I’m going to
start hosting Town Hall Meetings with my NYCHA developments and my first Town Hall Meeting will
be with Jackson Houses and Melrose Houses on March 11, 2019 at 6:00 PM at BronxWorks Classic
Center. So if you live in Melrose, if you live in Jackson please stop by, we’re going to have the General
Manager for the NYCHA developments in New York he will be present. We’re going to have tables
where you can put in a ticket number. We’re not just only going to have NYCHA there we’re inviting
NYPD PSA7, so we’re inviting the 40 Precinct, Parks Department and we’re inviting other City
Agencies. Because those individuals that live in NYCHA developments not just suffering from NYCHA
issues there are other City Agency issues that you may be dealing with and it’s going to give you an
opportunity to speak to those City Agencies.

In the City Council we’ve begun our Budget negotiations. The Mayor of New York presented a
preliminary Budget of 92 billion dollars compared to the last Budget cycle anywhere from 86 — 88 billion
dollars. So for those non-for-profits I see Destination Tomorrow here I know that the City Council we do
give you funding and other non-profits in the community that are interested in getting Discretionary
funding. I think that the application deadline already passed so hopefully that you did submit them at the
appropriate time. But the Capital deadline is coming up soon so those non-for-profits asking for Capital
dollars make sure that you submit your applications. Questions as to what qualifies for Capital dollars
feel free to call my office and we’ll be more than happy to explain that.

Lastly I just want to speak to you about three bills that I am working on in the City Council the first is
called the 15 Percent Homeless Set Aside. As you may know and this Community Board knows we’re
saturated with Homeless Shelters in your communities. Last night over 63 thousand individuals slept in a
homeless bed, 30 percent of homeless families in the City of New York are families who are sleeping in a
shelter just waiting for that opportunity to get into an apartment. This month actually March 8"" makes

Pg. 4

three years that I’ve been elected in office and in the three years that I’ve been in office I’ve approved a
little over 65 hundred units of 100 percent affordable housing 45 hundred units of new housing and I’ve
preserved over 2 thousand units. I’ve preserved the affordability of over 2 thousand units. Something that
I’ve noticed as the Chair of the Land Use Committee my community Ritchie Torres’s community, Diana
Ayala’s community, Vanessa Gibson’s community we’re doing our fair share when we are approving
new housing and when we’re setting aside homeless units but something that I noticed with some of my
other colleagues in other boroughs or my colleagues north of the Bronx is that they’re not doing their fair
share they’re negotiating down the homeless set aside and as a result I put in a bill about 8 months ago
which will require any Developer whether it’s private land or city owned lands if you’re getting a dollar
from the City of New York subsidies for that building 15 percent of those units must be set aside for
homeless families that are ready for independent living. It’s time that we stop putting families in shelters
and we start putting them in their own apartments so that they can thrive that’s what this bill does. The
Mayor of course was against this bill because his Housing 2.0 Plan called for a 5 percent homeless set
aside. I find it odd that homeless has increased under this Mayor’s watch and yet in my opinion he has
turned a blind eye on the issue. As of today I have 35 co-sponsors on this bill meaning that this bill is
veto proof whether the Mayor wants to accept it or not whether he wants to veto it or not it’s going to
pass and this is going to happen. So I will keep you posted as to how this bill moves forward in the City
Council. My second bill that I wanted to discuss and I know that you’ve heard a lot throughout the past
year lead, lead in our NYCHA developments its lead in our private developments. When a child has a
blood level high with lead a Doctor is mandated to submit a report to the Department of Health which in
return they go and investigate those apartments if there’s lead. Landlords are held accountable the
process is the landlord has the opportunity to go and check the apartment to check their paint to check
their walls to see if there’s lead and if they want to challenge that finding from the Department of Health
they can do so 95 percent of the time when there’s lead found in a NYCHA development NYCHA
challenges that finding. Yet only 4 percent when a private landlord is found to have lead in their
buildings they challenge it meaning that 95 percent of time that we find lead ina NYCHA development
NYCHA raises a hand and says oh it doesn’t exist and they just submit some bogus paperwork to the
Department of Health and the Department of Health at times just turns a blind eye and that continues in
that department. What my bill does is that it requires that whenever there’s a challenge there has to be
certain criteria’s that has to be followed where NYCHA needs to prove that there is no lead in those
apartments and there needs to be a quarterly report where the Department of Health provides the
Community Boards a report of where lead has been found and who has challenged it. It’s really to keep
track of that trend to see if NYCHA is actually doing good by our constituents. It’s more about putting
more scrutiny to this issue, so that’s the second bill. Finally the last bill that I want to bring up is called a
Woman In Arts bill. In the City of New York we have 150 statues, sculptures or paintings on city owned
land and only five of them are of women. In Central Park there is two dozen statues and none of them are
of women but in Central Park Alice in Wonderland has a statue, the huskie dog has a statue, Mother
Goose has a statue and Romeo and Juliet have a statue and so we put in a bill that will require the New
York City Design Commission the ones that approve all art that’s being installed on city owned land
moving forward that 50 percent of all art that is installed on city owned land is of women. So this bill has
major support in the City Council tomorrow March 1* starts Women’s Month and this bill will be passed
in Women’s Month. It’s important that women are recognized for what they’ve done in our communities
and there’s no better way of doing it then actually putting a live statute, sculpture or painting.

ELECTED OFFICIALS REPORTS

The representative for the Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz, Jr. said good evening
everybody. The Borough President is very concerned is beginning to see these small plots of land being
gobbled up by Developers and building very tall buildings on these lots that are predominately two and
three stories back. So what I’Il do is get your information and speak to James Rausch our Director Urban
Planning in our office and find out if he has more information on a particular project. I apologize for
sounding like a broken record by now but for those Board Members who haven’t taken the Sexual
Harassment Training please get it done. We’ve been notified by DCAS that the last day that the link will
be up will be on March 31“ so that is the last day you can take the training. For those Board Members
that are up for reappointment and have submitted their reappointment applications but have not taken the
training you will not be reappointed back to the Board so it’s something to bear in mind. So very quickly
the Borough President last week held his annual State of the Borough address and during the address he
announced the Camp Junior Program which is honor of Junior Guzman the young man that was killed last
summer over at Bathgate. This is a program that we partnered up with the New York State Department of
Parks and the Fresh Air Fund. It’s a summer program for kids, it’s a two-week sleep away program. I
have flyers in the back it has the website and the phone number where you can call if you have any kids
interested in applying for the program the ages are from 9 to 13. Again it’s a two-week sleep away
program. Also I wanted to share if you are already a community organization and you need space the
Department of Education will now lend space to community organizations. So if you want to have some
type of program in one of the DOE spaces or if you want to have maybe a sports program you can now
fill out the application for a permit to get the space over at DOE locations. Again the program is called
the Extended Use Hardship Waiver Program. I’ve brought flyers that will give you all the information on
how to go about getting that permit. Lastly just one more program we’re having a Constructions Job Fair
on Wednesday, March the 13"" over at the Bronx Court Building there will be folks there to help you get
your Apprenticeship and any papers that you need. Again I’ve brought flyers.

Questions and Comments

The representative for Congressman Serrano said that just a couple of updates. The Congressman
started as Chairman of the Appropriations Committee on Crime, Justice and Science. So he started this
position about two days ago. Right now we’re working one mostly with Climate Change and secondly
we’re working with the Federal Bureau of Presidents mostly because of the unfair conditions that
prisoners and the workers at the prisons are experiencing. So we’re trying to make some sort of
legislation that will help not only the prisoners but the workers have increase in safety and just the
conditions that they experience on a regular. So I know that a couple of weeks ago a lot of the prisoners
were here in Brooklyn were living without any sort of electricity or heating so we’re working against that
so that nothing like that ever happens to any of our prisoners or any of the workers that work in the prison
system. Just a couple of updates on some of our events we had our Black History Month event this past
Monday. But in March which starts tomorrow we’re going to have a Women’s History Month
celebration at the Bronx Museum and it will be on March 224 from 6 to 8 PM everyone is more than
welcome to come it will be a celebration of the women in our district 15. The last thing the 2020 Census

Pg. 6

so I know we have been having a lot of questions about whether the immigration question will be
included in the census on February 15"" the question was sent to the Supreme Court so we do not have an
answer on that yet. Obviously the Congressman is strongly opposed to it but if it does happen we will
work to find a way to see how we should address the question in our community. On a positive note for
the 2020 Census they’re hiring so there are thousands of jobs that will open in the district and if you guys
are interested or would like to share with anyone the website to find the job positions are
2020census.gov/jobs.

Questions and Comments

The representative from Senator Jose M. Serrano said that in February we were focused on
combating Domestic Violence and the importance of healthy relationships. We met with the Mayor’s
Office to end domestic violence and to provide resources and violence prevention strategies. Next month
we’re focusing on free legal services with a focus on immigration. For the schedule of the upcoming
Constituent Hours please see the calendar I put on the table. In recent days we have been experiencing
colder than usual temperature in New York City. If your building is not providing heat or hot water
please call our office at 212 — 828-5829. Stay vigilant in protecting yourself and your families from the
frigid weather and check on your elderly neighbors.

The representative from the Comptroller’s Office Scott Stringer said that I have a couple of
announcements today one of them is that we recently published a report that has to do with City Contracts
especially if you work for a non-profit or if you have worked for the city you know that it’s difficult to get
the funding. Many non-profits have to start by providing services and it takes a long time for them to
actually get the funding. So the Comptroller is proposing to implement a timeframe for the different
offices that have to oversee the process and that’s actually something that the Comptroller’s Office
already has implemented a timeframe for our own office but for other offices as well. The other thing is
to create some kind of website that you can go and check exactly where in the process is your contract
with the city and that way you have follow up because many times you expecting that funding but you
have no idea even in what office it is located right now the contract. For the last part of the report 89
percent of the contract related to Human Services came to the Comptroller’s Office right after the start
date of the contract 89 percent. So that’s why you see like the delay in this process if you need more
information let me know. I believe I put some copies of the report back there if you’re not able to grab a
copy I can send you an email with the information. The other information that I have is a reminder and I
already gave you this information last month but about the Internship Program the application deadline is
March 8"" it is for Undergrad and graduate students please apply. There were Workshops that started
today for people that want to make business with the city. If you have any questions let me know.

The representative for Councilwoman Diana Ayala said that we have a mobile mammogram van
that’s coming on March 22"" to 214 St. Ann’s Avenue. We also have a housing crisis where landlords are
harassing people and trying to get them out of their homes by misleading them with the Rent Stabilization
of their apartment they’ re trying to destabilize them. So we’re having a Tenant Housing Resource Fair on
March 12"" at St. Luke’s Church HPD will be there and a lot of agencies will be there to explain to you
what are your rights and the will be Lawyers there. If there’s anything that you need they will be able to
answer those questions. We have Immigration Services once a month the last Thursday of every month
you have to call and make an appointment.

BOROUGH PRESIDENT FULL BOARD MEETING sécduninn panei

GEORGE L. RODRIQUEZ MINUTES DISTRICT MANAGER

CHAIRPERSON January 31, 2019
PUBLIC SESSION

Ms. Myra Hernandez resident said that I’m here tonight as a Concord Avenue homeowner and
concerned citizen. Since hearing about de Blasio’s Jail Expansion Plan this year I have been shocked
about the betrayal and lack of communication and respect by Mayor de Blasio and Councilwoman Ayala.
Last year Ayala assured me that multiple meetings were being held to allow residents to voice our
concerns my neighbors and I have been invited to zero. Instead de Blasio and Ayala have resorted to
closed door negotiations to persuade people to sign off on a jail that would only hurt the community
disguised as a humane alternative to Riker’s a jail is no more than a cage. Rest assured if de Blasio and
Ayala build their jail they will fill it 88 percent of people detained at Riker’s are black and brown of the
thousands of people caged there many have to wait months, years until they get a trial while their families
scramble to get the funds to post bail. To cage people for merely being poor and colored is criminal and
to misguide our community into thinking a jail is humane is criminal. Do away with Riker’s but don’t
stop there do away with pre-trail detainment, do away with cash bail, do away with the criminalization of
minor offenses and our country shamefully ranks as number | in the world for incarcerating it’s citizens
and I urge you to refuse to invest billions of our tax dollars in jail structures that breakup families instead
invest in a better future for us invest in quality schools, invest in clean air, invest in quality affordable
homes, invest in employment opportunities, invest in making our community feel safe and valued. Many
of us residents are in this fight for the long run and will make sure that the architects of our communities
de Blasio, Viverito and Ayala will not be elected again. With no justice there is no peace.

Ms. Josephine Perez resident said that I am here as a parent of 8 children I adopted 4 of them and I
got the opportunity to live in the community and be able to raise my 8 children as a single parent with the
help of such program as ASPIRA which thank God still exists. I’m against all the jails to teach our
children that this is where you’re going to be going to. Putting a jail in a residential area there’s a lot of
places to put these jails and South Bronx shouldn’t be one of them just because of color just because
we’re minorities it shouldn’t be give our children a chance give our children their dreams. Thank God all
my children ended up being professionals all went to College all graduated High School. Thank God as a
single parent with the help of my community, I want that back in this community we have lost that let’s
give our children an opportunity to rise up and be productive men and women in society. No more jails.

Mr. Walter Wally Christopher Nash resident said that what I’m up here to speak about as a
homeowner on Concord Avenue whose been living in my house 74 years we’re the second family on that
block. I am now the last surviving original homeowner on that block and what I’m up here about tonight
is that Diana Ayala our City Councilperson has been holding secret meetings with Board Members of
Community Board One. Homeowners on Concord, Jackson, Wales and Tinton not one of us has ever

Pg. 2

been invited to a meeting until I busted their meeting and when I busted in they were shocked to see me.
Our members Mr. Johnson is selling us out he asking for things for the projects there isn’t no project
around Concord Avenue, Clarisa I don’t remember her last name but she is our Board Member all of them
asking for things in projects nothing do they say about Concord Avenue. They represent Board 1 not the
projects, not their own home, they represent Board 1 and Board | said from the beginning that we were
opposed to the jail. Why do we have sellouts from the Board and what I want to know is it legal now for
them to vote about the jail and if anything can be done about Ayala holding those secret meetings trying
to overthrow our Board and she should not be elected again in this here community and I will fight my
tail off until I’m dead none of them come on this Board again. We don’t want no jail and Ayala now is
trying to meet with Concord members after I called her out on it she’s a snake in the grass.

Mr. Raymond Figueroa, Jr. said that I’m here speaking in opposition to the prison. You should
know quickly just a little bit about me. I been based out of a Community Garden we run a Youth
Community Farm. That Youth Community Farm has been integrated very successfully in an alternative
to incarceration where we’re actually doing workforce development, actually doing entrepreneurial
opportunities with the field of the Green Economy. The program is very, very, very successful. The
young people who have either been incarcerated in their past or current court adjudicated and we’re doing
this for pennies on the municipal dollar. I want to suggest to you all very thoughtful members of the
Board and stakeholders in the community that we can accomplish reduction in recidivism for pennies on
the dollar. Those $10 billion dollars that are being advocated allocated for prison construction here and in
China Town could be better spent. The New York Civil Liberties Union produced a report where they
identified the issues around what is happening and not happening vis-a-vie our education system for
Bronx District 7 has probably the highest school suspension rate in the city. One of the lowest academic
outcome being reported out of this district and it’s correlated with the New York Civil Liberties Union
report which came out about 5 years ago. They said hay this puts people at risk for becoming
incarcerated. So we really need to think how do we and let me just put out another information reference
it’s called a Justice Atlas it’s an interactive mapping source it identifies all the communities from where
people are incarcerated come from. It’s over $3,000 dollars to incarcerate one person in the State of New
York we’re not even spending a fraction of that in terms of education for 1 person in the State of New
York. Something is wrong with this picture and it has to do with the expectations for the South Bronx.
Let’s be very clear structural racism has been a foot for decades in Mott Haven. Structural racism what I
mean by this is the redlining, the concentration of poverty meaning the projects along with no job
opportunities and urban renewal. So much so that there was a homeowner a conversation that she had
with Councilwoman Ayala saying oh well this community is blighted, that’s not a coincidence. We really
need to address the issues that are effecting our community. This prison does nothing of the sort. We
need to invest like what we’re doing in workforce development and education. I’ve had young people
come to my program serious gang bangers, people with gun charges very deeply involved in that type of
activity for lack of other alternatives who have graduated High School and are now in College. Se we can
actively do this for pennies on the dollar, and we ought to demand that our tax dollars be spent in the most
effective way possible. What happens I was just having a conversation that you know there’s still
problems with employment for someone who incarcerated, there’s still problems with entry after one is
incarcerated. To be sure if you come from public housing and if you have a record of incarceration that
means that you’re going to be homeless, you can’t come back. You’re struggling not just financially to
get a job, but also in terms of housing. How does one stabilize themselves after they’ve paid debt to
society? So let’s be very, very reasonable this prison is a non-starter our community needs to look at the
real issues address it and stop going around with band aids and this is not a band aid it’s structural racism

Pg. 3

and structural oppression. We have to use it for what it is and that means it’s not a coincidence that the
community is blighted but guess what we can take the responsibility back as a community in terms of
what we’ve been doing and what we continue to be establishing in this community.

Ms. Tahniqua Williams Heketi Charter School said that we have a community Charter School
right on Concord Avenue which is in the Mott Haven section of the Bronx. What I’m here to do is to
promote our upcoming Resource Fair. There’s a lot of community members and organizations here in
this room so if you are available it’s this upcoming Wednesday, February 6"" from 3:00 to 5:00 PM. We
would like for you to come in and share your resources to our community members and families.

CHAIRMAN AND DISTRICT MANAGER’S REPORT

The District Manager said under the Public Hearing process we received an application on the item.
Please be advised that we do not have a quorum the presentation is going to take place tonight. I ask for
all Board members to adjust their calendars. There will be a meeting and vote on this item next Thursday.
The item was approved by the Committee this month.

The presentation will be by Mr. Michael Wadman, Vice President Phipps Houses and Ms. Kay Real from
HPD as part of this project.

PUBLIC HEARING OPENED

Ms. Kay Real HPD said that I represent HPD who is the co-applicant on this application along with
Phipps Houses. We are here tonight to propose a project on the corner of East 156"" Street Brook Avenue
know as Brook 156. The development site is made up of 2 adjacent lots 1 and 3. Lot 1 is formerly an
abandoned railroad trench owned by Phipps Houses and lot 3 is small and city owned. The city is willing
to convey the city owned property to Phipps because together with their property it creates a larger
assemblage to create more affordable housing. With Brook 156 we will be able to provide 55 units of
affordable rental housing with 1 Superintendent I a new 9 story building and ground floor community
facility. The railway was put out of use in 1999 and was formerly abandoned in 2005. For years the
trench was full of trash with some undesirable uses. So this is a ULURP application to be voting on a


Pg. 4

zoning map change R7-2 to C6-2, zoning text amendment to apply Mandatory Inclusionary Housing and
a special permit to allow for development over the trench.

Mr. Michael Wadman Vice President Real Estate Department said that so the opening slide
here is just a rendering of the new building which we’re proposing and the backdrop to it is the Via Verde
Development immediately to the south. This is the corner of Brook Avenue and 156"" Street it’s two lots
one of them is the railroad cut that goes along there and you probably seen some other projects that are
connected too and the other lot is a city owned lot.

So a little bit about Phipps Houses we’re the largest non-profit housing developer in New York City. So
we’re an entirely charitable issue based organization that provides affordable housing and also
community services through our Phipps Social Service affiliate. This is one of the main neighborhoods
that we operate in very close to our mission and our heart. We have financial literacy programs just a
little further up on Third Avenue we have something like two thousand apartments in this general area
including some in Community Board 3 as well as your Community Board and will be the owner of the
project. The Development Team Dattner Architects is here tonight as well they were one of the
Architects on Via Verde and one of the most accomplished affordable housing Architects in the city. We
do not have a General Contractor selected yet but we will select one through a bidding process and among
the many things we make sure they do minority hiring and that kind of thing as well as Contractors Then
Phipps has a Property Management Company that does the Property Management. This is the site in the
red that’s the ballfield there that’s Via Verde over here. So there are a few items that are being done the
zoning is being changed from R7-2 to C6-2 they’ Il be the mandatory Inclusionary Housing overlay that is
always almost required now that’s a very minimal amount of affordability compared to what we’re
actually going to be doing here. Everything we do is 100 percent income restricted and we’re regulated
we don’t do any market rent housing. So the project itself will be entirely affordable housing. In terms of
the building we’re planning here the plan is for a nine story apartment building it’s quite a small parcel
and as a result we got about a 55 unit building on the project. The nine stories is quite a bit less than Via
Verde across the street and there are other buildings in the neighborhood that are of similar sizes. Well
also have about 1,100 sq. feet of community facility space on ground floor potentially on the corner right
of Brook and 156"". The goal is to have our Social Services in the Phipps Neighborhood related to Youth
Employment. Youth is one of the main focus areas of Phipps Neighborhood both workforce and
development training. So that’s the goal for that space in the building. So these are the various corners
that’s the site there that’s the railroad cut this is the Melrose Court Condominium and that’s the
development site. So it’s been an eyesore for quite a while and we owned the part of the site that we own
for almost ten years now and the reason that it has been delayed because of the railroad cut there were a
series of bridges that DOT has to fill in. So DOT has actually chosen a Contractor and is preparing to do
that closure. So as a result the site will be acceptable for development. There doing it throughout that
stretch that goes all the way up to 163 Street. So as I mentioned one of the lots is owned by a Phipps
affiliate the Housing Development Company and the other site is owned by the City. This is

the tunnel closure this thin triangle here is city owned and this rectangular thing here is Phipps owned.
This is just showing you the bridge that’s going to be closed by DOT as you guys all know it’s a bit of a
mess and has been for quite some time so this will eliminate that mess.

Ms. Jen Switala Dattner Architects said that this diagraph shows the various components of the
project. As you can see the ground floor on the south end on 156"" Street as Michael mentioned will be an
11 hundred sq. foot community facility that will be operated by Phipps that will be open to the


Pg.5

community and we hope that will provide some kind of activity on that corner which is pretty much
deserted there’s nothing on the site tight now. Then as you go north along Brook Avenue we’ve indented
the building a little bit so that there’s a little entrance courtyard to the building and I’! point out how you
enter the building that will be landscaped in green and then on the north end a bright yellow portion on
the ground floor will be a community room for the residents but again with windows facing the street so it
will be kind of eyes on the street. Then above that and again we are proposing a nine story building and
above the ground floor is eight floors of residential.

So these are renderings of the building the first rendering on the left is looking south towards Via Verde
on Brook Avenue and the building will be clad in brick and the darker color of brick will be very similar
to the brick that is at the base of Via Verde. At the ground floor of Via Verde it’s kind of a dark color but
kind of lively brick. Thought it would be a nice compliment to the Via Verde project to use that brick.
On the south end wrapping around to the eastside Melrose Court side we’re proposing to use a lighter
color brick which we think would complement the color of the Melrose Court buildings which are light
colored buildings. So we’re trying to balance even though admittedly this is a larger building then the
Melrose Court buildings we’re trying to relate to those buildings in terms of the color. In the ground floor
Via Verde used you can’t quite see in this photograph those are sort of orange accents. What we’re
proposing here is an orange glazed brick. So it’s kind of a glossy brick that will add an element of color
and again make the streetscape a little livelier and relate to the colors at Via Verde.

So this is the ground floor and I would like to point out here starting at 156"" Street this is the community
space and right off the corner of Brook Avenue is the community facility space that will be operated by
Phipps and we have this landscaped area that I mentioned so again we have to finalize the details of it so
we certainly welcome any input but we have kind of a low fence to kind of keep dogs from going in and
keep people out but since the Super’s apartment is right there overlooking that space it will be a little bit
of a deterrent of garbage being thrown in there and so on. This area would be paved so it’s almost like
part of the sidewalk and residents would walk in through a vestibule into the lobby you have the
mailroom so if you’re a resident standing out here you can see right into the elevators right next to the
entrance door will be the intercom for visitors. Phipps has a very robust security system of cameras and
so on. To maintain security in the building is very important management function that Phipps does.
Now in the rest of the ground floor right next to the lobby we have this room and this again will be for the
residents with equipment for fitness and workout and then this yellow space it’s not what the color of the
room will be it’s just for diagram is a community room for the residents that will have a pantry a small
kitchen for resident events you know birthday parties and similar things. Then behind the building we
have a small outdoor patio for the residents and the community and would expect that there would be a
fence around there. This is Melrose parking that you were talking about I think we need to get into a
more detailed discussion about the trash removal I was with Adam at that meeting two years ago and I do
recall the discussion about refuse removal and I think we should get into how that’s actually going to
work. One possibility again depending on how much space is needed to utilize some portion of this space
that opens off the former 157"" Street something we’ll definitely have to discuss and workout with
Melrose Court.

So this is the typical residential floor we have a total of 55 apartments and 25 percent of the apartments
are studios the average size is 360 sq. feet they have full bathrooms and full kitchens closets this is HPD’s
balancing the benefits to the individual family with the pressing need to build affordable housing for New
Yorkers so there’s a balance between the smaller the units the more units you can make versus larger
units. These are the apartment layouts we have two elevators, stairs the corridors all have natural light we
are going to be seeking what is called LEED Certification it’s a measure of sustainability so that the
building will be energy efficient. This is one of the upper floors it’s a slightly different plan.

Pg. 6

Mr. Michael Wadman Vice President Real Estate Department said that a direct segue into the
income levels and marketing. So the income levels we’re looking to serve here are pretty wide from 30
percent of the Area Medium Income up to 80 percent. HPD as you probably know requires a formerly set
aside in all projects for the homeless so 10 percent of the units are in that 30 percent six families in this
case. As mentioned there’s a community room, fitness room. On the unite types this is much fewer
larger units then Phipps typical provides. We primarily serve a low income family population. Basically
because of the very small site we have a lot more smaller units then we would typically do. I think that
the opportunity that is presents is to try to market more aggressively to senior citizens for those smaller
units. We’re not allowed to set aside units for seniors in a mixed population building. So it’s not that
they would strictly be set aside but it would be a marketing effort to try to get senior citizens into the
building. The goal would be to find seniors who take advantage of the smaller units and that would be
kind of a way of fitting the right kind of person to use them. So this shows you kind of specifically these
are the income ranges for the families that would qualify for each of the ranges. There will also be units
at the 30 percent income but not for the formerly homeless selection typically people that make that level
of income then it goes up to 40, 50, 60 and 80. So the income goes all the way from people making $20
thousand dollars for a single to about $85 thousand dollars a year for a family. This is the Welfare Shelter
Allowance that would apply for those rents the next category are people who are 30 percent of Medium
but are not coming out of the shelter system and are not typically employed but earning less money and
then we go up to 40 percent, 50, 60, and 80 percent of medium income.

So this $18 million dollars is a construction estimate with another several million dollars of soft costs. As
mentioned it will have Enterprise Green Certification will probably have solar energy panels we do that in
almost all of our buildings now. As we’ve said before the construction employment will be overseen
pretty rigorously. Then the last little piece this is HPD’s ELLA Program which serves primarily the low
income population. This is also a Brownfield cleanup site which is also typical of most of our projects.
Then we’re going to be applying to the State for the rest of the money. We’re hoping to close the
financing in 9 months to start construction and the building should take anywhere from 18 to 24 months.
It will take about two years and then be occupied by 2020 or 2021 assuming all goes well.

Questions and Comments

The District Manager said that I sincerely want to thank those Board members that came out tonight,

CHAIRMAN AND DISTRICT MANAGER’S REPORT

The District Manager said as you can see on the Agenda we have two presentations and we will
begin with the first one on the construction of the new 40"" Police Precinct.

Mr. Philip Heller Director of Capital Construction for the New York City Police
Department said that of the New York City Police Department said that we’re here to actually tell you
that we’re going to finally start building this thing. In my unit we’re charged with building new buildings
for the Police Department so we recently completed the new Police Academy on College Point and in
meantime have turned our attention to the 40 Precinct now in impending construction. We have a new
design and we’re really going to get going on it. So Cleveland Adams is with the Department of Design
and Construction the New York City agency that’s actually building this thing. So the Architects and
Contractors they all work for Cleveland so any issues he’s the guy. We’re very close the two teams we
have a Management Firm involved.

As anybody whose just been a block away or has been by there’s some trailers on the site and we’re
getting started on construction probably in another month or so. As these things go we have the
Contractors on board they have to kind of get everything going they have to get permits in place we’re
really going to get to see some action hopefully by the end of July beginning of August and we anticipate
everything being done by early 2021 is kind of what we’re looking at for completion of construction. So
Pll show you just a little bit of the overall design of the building and kind of get into the details a little bit,
So the first slide is actually from East 149% Street and if you’re on the street here kind of going east this is
how the building will appear. One of things I’m going to talk about right away is the Community Room.
This building is 45 thousand square feet that’s three floors and a basement. Just for comparison the
existing 40"" is about half that size. Really what we try to do now a days is build our new buildings to
serve the community and police needs so part of that is building a building with lots of different
functions. There’s also the need for adequate locker space one of the things that drives the size of these
buildings is lockers. They built the original building back in the 1920°s we didn’t have quite the
equipment needs we really didn’t have the separation of male and female because it was men mostly so
men and female lockers take up a lot of space. Not only just making a modern efficient space to work in
but for to address the cramped conditions. Anyone whom has been in the 40"" knows of the cramped
conditions. Fortunately this site has been available it was made available in the 80°s and here we are
actually doing something.

One of the important things to note this is the Horizon Juvenile facility. So essentially the building is
going to be on the corner here and then it’s this whole sort of length of St. Ann’s Avenue all the way back
to Westchester. So will show you a little bit about what that’s going to look like this is just kind of from
the two corners the top view is from St. Ann’s and East 149"" and the bottom view is from Westchester
and St. Ann’s. The existing lower railroad remains it’s not ours and it actually goes under our site. So we
have again a three story building here and about 90 parking spaces total. One of the big things we like to
do when we look for sites for Precincts is find parking. When building a new building we’re required to
have some on-site parking anyway we want to get as much as we can because the big issue that
communities have is cars NYPD vehicles and personal vehicles out on the street so we have 90 spaces
which is pretty good. So our intent is to get as many cars off the street as possible. So there are a lot of
guidelines to follow and some of this comes from citywide initiatives having to do with sustainability and
efficiency. By actually building a modern building it really assists in the citywide portfolio of buildings.
So it’s a very high efficiency building with green roofs on top of the building. One of those things about

Pg.3

being able to police in the proper way to have a good working environment so with more space to work
provides for better environment so then you’re a better Officer. The Officers are amongst you out in the
community but when they come back to the building they should have a decent place to take a shower,
change their clothes, file reports all those things could happen in a good working environment. There are
physical fitness areas within the building itself. So what we’ve really done for the first time in any Police
Precinct is a dedicated community space. So essentially the idea is that programming of activities can
happen in coordination with the Precinct but it’s really a place for community and a place to come
together. Questions we get a lot what are you going to do in that space well I’m not going to do anything
I'm building it so that you and the NCO’s can work together and find a use for it. What we have always
had in our commands is the Muster Room a two thousand square room where a lot of times you have the
Community Precinct Council meetings. This is smaller but you still have that and can hold the larger
meetings there and you can also have a smaller more informal space. Important to note that it is all the
way in the front of the building and has its own door from the outside next to the main entrance to the
command. So you are coming into an NYPD building but it’s a new standard for that. So this is the front
of the building and this is the main entrance and the Muster Room is actually right here and all that stuff
there would be accessible to you is at the front of the building. This is along St. Ann’s Avenue so coming
around the side this is the parking lot that is directly behind the building so the police entrance is directly
to the back. Again one of the things we do in a modern building not everybody comes through the front
door. In that central space the Desk Sergeant has total view of the command and will be able to see
upstairs, downstairs, the doors and elevators. So we’ve really made that spacious and roomy enough for
the traffic that comes in and out.

Mr. Cleveland Adams Architect said that two of the art pieces being designated for the 40"" Precinct
will have an Artist working with us to do a custom design which is going to add to the character and then
we’re also working with an Artist in the community room to give it life. Those Artists both of them have
been working with the NCO’s at the 40"" and been doing some community outreach which has been
happening over the last couple of months trying to get a little more input before designing something.

Questions and Comments

The District Manager said that there would be a Public Hearing on an item that has come before the
Economic Development-Land Use and Housing Committee back in September of 2017. It is now an item
going through the ULURP Process was certified this month under that process and the project is 599
Courtlandt Avenue project.

The District Manager said that the Councilmember was present and asked if he would like to make
some comments.

Councilmember Rafael Salamanca said that very briefly I just wanted to come and just wish you all
a happy summer. I know the last couple of days and last week has been rough for everyone who has been
following the media with that vicious murder that happened to that fifteen year old. That happened in
Richie Torres’s district in the Belmont area not too far from the end of my district. It is my understanding
that young men have been apprehended and some of them that were in Jersey I think are being extradited
as we speak. But I know that in speaking with Darcel Clarke that the DA’s Office is focused in ensuring
that we get justice for Junior. So it’s a very emotional case I have an eighteen year old at home and |

Pg. 4

have a three year old at home and I think what if my eighteen year old went outside and this happens to
him. You know my wife and I got very emotional because how would we react and it’s just unfortunate
of what happened and please keep them in your prayers.

Just two weeks ago we passed the budget at the City Council and we approved about an $87 billion dollar
budget for the City of New York and some of the wins that we have been able to bring we were able to
approve what is called Fair Fares. I don’t know if you’ve been following that we got $212 million dollars
for Fair Fares basically for low-income families or low-income individuals that have a hard time
purchasing a metro card whether its’ a monthly metro card or weekly metro card and its for individuals in
a certain income bracket. As you know that is one of the main reasons that the NYPD make arrests in
community of color they’re jumping the turnstile and it is illegal to jump the turnstile and what happens
you go straight to jail. We have individuals who need help that are looking for work and they may not
have that metro card to go to their interview. It’s good to know that we will be able to help low-income
families in communities of color such as mine to give them discounted metro cards. We got some money
for NYCHA $500 million dollars it’s not going to cover everything it’s just to know that we were able to
allocate x amount of dollars to NYCHA. The Melrose Library it’s not too far from here they had come
and asked me for $1.2 million dollars for a third floor that they needed and I was able to secure the $1.2
million dollars for them. We increased the funding for what is called and Alternative for Incarceration
basically to help the youth in the community who are struggling who are having issues or just going
through the Justice System and they need help and it’s our responsibility as a community to provide them
with those resources. So that was it I know that you have a lot of presentations and I just wanted to say
thank you for everything that you do as a Community Boardmember to come on a Wednesday evening to
come to meetings you’re dedicated and I really appreciate the service that you’re providing within
Community Board 1.

Questions and Comments

Councilmember Fernando Cabrera said that I’ve come with good news. Let me just give you the
context for those that missed me the last time I was here. I came recruiting your help so we could get
funding to Community Boards. As many of you know you have only received $27 thousand since 2021
for your base funding for budget for your Community Board. That’s really not fair Councilmembers, the
Mayor’s Office and just about everybody else gets the proper funding that we need but those who do
volunteer and I know because I was a Community Boardmember at Community Board No. 7 who are
volunteering week after week are not getting the resources that they are supposed to get. So I went to the
Mayor’s Office during the budget negotiations and I’m very disappointed to let you know that the
Mayor’s Office refused to give funding to the Community Boards. But I come with good news we have a
tremendous new Speaker Corey Johnson we worked on the budget we were able to find about $2.5
million so it comes out to $43 thousand dollars for each of the Community Boards that you will have this
year and you will be able to spend it on anything you want other than unfortunately salary because it falls
under our initiative so that means you will be able to hire a Consultant if you want to have the biggest
concert you’ve ever had in your district National Night Out it’s up to you. So congratulations and thank
you for the letters of support and at the end of the day really the thanks belongs to you for the work that
you do and I know that you have a full agenda. So thank you so much and God Bless You.

PUBIC HEARING OPEN

Pg.5

The District Manager said now will begin the Public Hearing on the 599 Courtlandt Avenue Project.

Ms. Kay Real from HPD said that the project is 599 Courtland Avenue located between 150"" Street
and 151* Street. In 2005 the City conveyed this property to Procida construction group under the New
Foundations ownership. Due to the small size of the project ULURP was not required and it was
approved through the Accelerated UDAP Process and the project then ran into difficulty due to the
structural instability of the adjacent abandoned church and the project was ultimately stalled due to
economic constraints. So now we are proposing an As-of-Right building that will provide eight units of
affordable rental housing with ground floor commercial. Due to the increase size of the building ULURP
Process is now needed and to facilitate this process the city must reacquire the property and properly
dispose of it so as a result the ULURP action you’re voting on tonight are acquisition of property by the
city and then the UDAP designation and disposition of the property. So I’ll turn it over now to the
Development Team who are here to present the details of the project.

Mr. Peter Procida said that I work with Procida Construction Corp it’s a family owned business we’ve
been located on 173"" between Park and Washington since 1976 I’m the fourth generation in the family
and right now I work on most of our development projects. We’re a General Contractor and Developer
we’ve worked throughout the Bronx on projects such as Melrose Court which is on St. Ann’s, the Orion
and Dorado on Third Avenue and 156"" currently we’re working as a builder on the Tres Puente Project
which is at the corner of 138"" and Third Avenue. So we’ve been active in the Bronx for a pretty long
time and we’ve worked with HPD for a very long time. 599 Courtlandt is an 8-unit project it’s located on
Courtlandt between 150"" and 151%. So we’re probably about here right now and here’s the site is pretty
small right now there’s a larger vacant parcel but we only own this 30 foot piece this is owned by a non-
profit who owns the corner site. We’ve spoken to them about trying to do a partnership and tried to
acquire they’re site and they weren’t interested so we’ve moved forward with the 8-unit development.

Right here is a 5-story mixed use building and there’s a bodega on the ground floor with apartments
above. Here’s a quick site plan we have a 4-story building which has a setback on the third floor and a
small rear yard for the use of the tenants. The site contains for the Development Team Procida is the
Developer we’re working with UDI the Architects we’re still trying to determine who the General
Contractor is going to be there’s a small chance that we do it however most projects are a little bit bigger
so we are trying to find a smaller General Contractor preferably someone whose local to take on this
project and then from the Management side we’re going to work with the Wavecrest Management whom
we’ve had a long standing relationship with. So as I said its 8-units its mostly small units there are 5-
studios, 2-one-bedrooms, and 1-three-bedroom. The fourth floor is a 3-bedroom unit that has its own
private outdoor space and there’s 750 square feet of ground floor retail space. The retail rent we’re trying
to market it at a discount we’re targeting somewhere in the range of $950 dollars to $2,000 dollars a
month for this space and we will see what the market will bear and we’re hoping for somebody local who
wants to run a small restaurant, a small coffee shop or a small boutique something of that nature. So I’ll
leave my contact information with the District Manager. We’re probably two years out but if there are
people who you might think are interested we’re always happy to meet with them. For the AMI levels
this is on the higher side for this district there are 4-units at 100 percent AMI, 3-units at 80 percent AMI
and 1-unit at 60 percent AMI. Most of you have the handouts where I have all the income levels listed for
the household size, the different incomes and then the rents for the different unit types that’s on the last
page of your handout.

ELECTED OFFICIALS REPORTS

Ms. Saadia Santos representative for Senator Jose M. Serrano said that I just began a few
weeks ago working as a Community Liaison for the Senator Jose Serrano. The 2018 Legislative session
ended last week and after months of constant blocking and inaction by the Senate Republicans the
Democratic Congress was pretty much prevented from advancing most of their legislative goals. One
piece of legislation that the Senator is excited about is the New York State Liberty Act focuses on how
Local and State Law Enforcement Agencies, Healthcare Providers and others approach and handle
immigration information and issues so among other options this legislation would prevent Law
Enforcement from stopping, questioning investigating or arresting a person based on perceived
immigration status and would curtail the use of state and local facilities for Federal Immigration
enforcement. There has not been any action on this bill since it was introduced into the Finance
Committee in January but next Legislative Session the Senator will again try to bring this serious issue to
the Senate Floor.

Mr. Aurman Kejela the representative for Assemblyman Michael Blake said that the first
thing that I just wanted to talk about was that the Assemblymember and everyone in his office has been
working to canvass the entire district to talk to his constituents so there’s a real connection and we can
talk about how the office solve all of your life’s problems for any of his constituents and the office really
does help with any quality of life problems everything from housing to immigration and legal aid. The
Assemblymember also wanted you to know that specifically with housing the Assemblymember has
Tenant Tuesday’s at his District Office at 780 Concourse Village West where anybody can come in and
get help from the Tenant Service support staff there especially relating to housing issues. We’re also
looking for volunteers help so if you want to volunteer or you know someone that would like to volunteer
I will be leaving the Assemblyman’s information. We are also looking for interns this summer so if you
know any young people who might want to intern for the Assemblyman I’d definitely give the office a
call. Finally, we’d like to thank Community Board 1for continuing to serve our constituents and a special
thank you to the Chairman George Rodriguez, the District Manager Cedric Loftin and all the
Boardmembers. The Assemblyman wishes you a great summer.

Public Session

Captain Robert Gallittelli Commander of the New York City Police Department Housing Bureau
(PSA7) said that I started about a month ago and trying to get out to as many community meetings as I
can so that everyone can see me, see my face and know whose at PSA7 now. I have almost 17 years with
the Department prior to my assignment here was the Commanding Officer of Bronx Gang and before
Bronx Gang I was in Narcotics. I do have some past experience with housing I worked in PSAS5 in East
Harlem when I first got promoted. I’ve kind of been all over I’ve been in the Bronx, upper Manhattan,
Queens so I’ve been around. Really just wanted to stop by and tell you some of the goings on in PSA7
right now. Just recently we did a large scale take-down at the Millbrook Houses and we really want to
key everybody in into that take-down. So that was done by Narcotics along with the Gun Violence
Division as well as the Safe Streets Taskforce which is a joint FBI/NYPD Unit. There were 35 arrests
made with that take-down they were looking at homicides and shots fired going all the way back to 2007
and with this take-down they’re going to prosecute 17 shooting incidents so it’s phenomenal work and I
think that it’s going to really go a long way to make things much safer at Millbrook because high level
drug traffickers were locked up in that take-down. It’s going to be really good for the community so we
just wanted to kind of let you guys know about the take-down.

Detective Irizarry said that we have a breast cancer event on Saturday on 169"" and Washington starting
at 9:30 AM.

Rebekah Shoaf of Boogie Down Books said that I’m here to talk to you about an event that my new
Startup Boogie Down Books is hosting this Saturday as well as November 4” and 18"" as you all know

Pg.2

there are currently no general interest bookstores in the Bronx and there are no specialty bookstores for
children and teenagers for our young people under the age of 18 which comprises approximately 25
percent of Bronx residents. So my new startup Boogie Down Books is hoping to address that this
Saturday, October 28"" we’re doing a free Popup Book Shop for kids and teenagers between the ages of
11 and 18 in the South Bronx. We are giving away 200 hundred books kids and caregivers are welcome
and we are doing that at MS343 at 345 Brook Avenue there are flyers being distributed that have this
information on it. Then on November 4"" and 18 we are hosting three Book Clubs on for anyone so not
just for the 200 young people who get the free books from us this Saturday but for anyone who wants to
join is welcome to come together with us. Research tells us that the two life-long issues in promoting
reading in young people are the ability to choose what they read and the opportunity to talk about what
they’ve read in a community of readers and we’re working to promote that. Three things Tl say about
our partnerships we are grateful to be partnering with MS343 for our space this Saturday and we’re
grateful to be partnering with the New York Public Library the Mott Haven Branch for the 4% and 18%
Book Club meetings. We’re also partnering with a non-profit called House of Speak Easy which has a
mobile book truck and they will be joining us on October 28"" giving out free magazines to younger
children and also selling books at discounted prices. So for people who want one of our books but are not
eligible for a free one and prefer to purchase one they can do that with the book truck. Finally on
November 18* is the second round of Book Club meetings we have at least two Authors who will be
joining us. I left some flyers on the desk available in English and Spanish. The Book Clubs are facilated
by volunteer Educators.

Ms. Jeanine Thomas-Cross Library Manager Mott Haven Library said that on November 17th we’re
going to have panelist and a discussion and we’re trying to get youth to come in to talk about violence in
the community. So we’re going to have Actors and we’re trying to get either Denzel Washington or
Jennifer Lopez and there’s a whole group of people that we’re trying to get to come out and it’s going to
be VIP for the youth. After that they’re going to do the Hercules Play and then after that we’re going to
have a discussion. That’s on November 17"" from 4:30 to 7:00. We also have a program that is called
Mentoring at the Library it’s a President Obama initiative and it’s for kids in High School from 15 to 18
years old they either come to the Library on Tuesdays or Thursdays with free pizza. They’re getting them
ready to build resumes, for jobs set goals and explore different career pathways. So far we have about 30
kids that are already enrolled we can have 15 in one group and 15 in the other group.

Ms. Glennie Gomez from the New York City Department of Education said that I’m here to briefly
speak to you about Specialized High Schools. We are an outreach team that the Chancellor Carmen
Farina and the Mayor Bill de Blasio have created a few months ago and this is to increase the diversity in
Specialized High Schools. What are Specialized High Schools that are schools that are public schools
free but they provide 4 years of science, math technology to engineering. There is a history of low
percentage of African American and Hispanics that are just not enrolled in the Specialized High Schools
but they’re not taking the admission exam that is required to get in. So this outreach team has been
working and been here before at the Community Board. We have attended more than 25 Middle Schools
that we have given power point presentations of the High School admissions process with an emphasis on
the Specialized High School admissions process. Speaking to students in the 6"", 7"" and 8"" grades and to
parents. Working closely with the School Counselors, and Parent Coordinators so that we can have
access to the parents. We have held close to 31 information sessions at New York City Libraries
throughout the boroughs of Bronx, Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens and it’s for that same purpose so
that we can reach out to the parents we are going where the parents are. We are active with the
Community Boards throughout the different boroughs and myself I’m active here in Community Board 1

Pg. 3

and we have Specialist in all different boroughs. So we are making sure that whatever communications
we have we forward it to the Community Boards so they can share it with the community. We are
planning to try to present at NYCHA developments that is a priority and is going to take a lot of
Specialists which we don’t have at this time but we are planning to and specifically with shelters also.
We’re planning on going to shelters so that we can speak on Specialized High Schools and how we can
increase the numbers of the students that take this exam. This weekend we had the Specialized High
School exam given so that we are waiting for the numbers and we have another exam that will be given to
the 4"" of November. We also work very hard to do outreach by calling parents because the Department
of Education also runs the Dream Program which is their 22 month free to students that demonstrate that
they have high grades in math and reading comprehension on their State Exam. So we hope that with the
work we’ve been doing that we have a higher percentage of African American and Hispanic that took the
exam.

We are active and have been active in the Middle and High School Fairs by tabling and when I say tabling
we’re not just sitting there we have Specialists like myself and I speak Spanish other Specialists speak
Mandarin and French as well so that we can really speak to the parents and let them know the importance
of having the students take the exam and also we have brochures. We have student handbooks that we
provide and most of all the Libraries have received boxes in English and Spanish. It’s a free student
handbook you can go to the nearest Library.

Chairman and District Manager’s Report

The District Manager Cedric L. Loftin said that tonight there is a presentation by the New York City
Department of Social Services, Human Resource Administration and Department of Homeless Services
related to the Mayor’s “Turning the Tide on homelessness in New York City. This is related to DHS
homelessness Policy by the Mayor over the last year. We have a site in our district that is being looked at
now for siting out of this process. I have invited those agencies to come and the Chairman also wanted
them to come to speak to the Board about this process and to answer any questions that the Board
Members may have.

Pg. 4

Ms. Jackie Bray First Deputy Commissioner for the Department of Homeless Services said that I’m
also here with Iris Rodriguez Associate Commissioner for Adults to speak about the Mayor’s Plan for
Turning the Tide on Homelessness in New York City but also about the opening of a facility here in this
district. This plan will citywide end the use of cluster sites and hotels while opening 90 new more
effective traditional shelters.

The plan is for homeless New Yorkers from every community across the five boroughs the opportunity to
be sheltered closer to their support systems including schools, jobs, healthcare, family, houses of worship
and the communities that they called home in order to more quickly stabilize their lives.

Central to our plan is the closing cluster sites and hotel facilities. We are phasing out the use of one hotel
and 110 cluster units across 16 sites in this community as part of the Turning the Tide. As part of this
plan 17 out of the currently 27 sites utilized by DHS in this Community Board will be phased out.

About 70 percent of shelter residents are families, but in Board 1 nearly 150 families are being sheltered
in less effective facilities that are being phased out as part of the plan which includes the one commercial
hotel and 110 cluster units that will no longer be used. This community also does not have any shelters
specifically for the supporting of adult families. This new facility will be the first in the community that
is dedicated to helping adult homeless families to get back on their feet with comprehensive social
services. Preference will be given to adult families from CB1 but there might be other families that meet
the criteria and will not be from this district or the Bronx.

This new facility at 500 East 134"" Street will house 94 adult families being offered the opportunity to be
sheltered closer to their support networks in the community they call home in order for them to be able to
more quickly stabilize their lives. The on-site services will include case management, housing placement
assistance, health and mental health services and employment counseling. Off-site linkages include
primary healthcare, substance use treatment, vocational training, employment placement, GED
instruction, conflict mediation and legal services. The average length of stay is approximately a year and
ahalf. There is a 10:00 PM curfew but those individuals who work late hours will receive passes to
return to the facility after curfew based on their documented work schedule. This facility is scheduled to
open in November. Westhab a not-for-profit service provider with over 30 years’ experience in operating
transitional housing facilities will operate this site.

Ms. Danielle Presto Principal from PS65 said that ’m on 141* Street and Cypress Avenue so there’s at
least 6 to 8 shelters in a five-block radius. When I came in I was looking through the information and
wondering where the focus on education is and then I realized a little bit later that we’re talking about an
adult shelter so I kind of simmered down. So I will gladly come back when you’ re ready to talk about the
interrupted education and I am super passionate about what I do so I would welcome a conversation.

Questions and Comments

The District Manager asked if there was anyone that wanted to speak. There was no one.

Ms. Jackie Bray said that we welcome input from the community and whenever possible will make
adjustments based on feedback from the community.

Pg. 5

The District Manager Cedric L. Loftin said that he would be emailing the Board Members a copy of
the FY 2019 Needs Statement and Budget Request and would like a response for any additions by
November 2, 2017.

The Chairman called for a motion on his and the District Manager’s Report.
Motion made to approve the Chairman’s and District Manager’s Report as presented. Motion duly
seconded. Motion called and passed unanimously.

Elected Officials Reports

The representative from the Bronx Borough President’s Office Ruben Diaz, Jr. said that so as you
heard today there’s a homeless crisis issue in this city. So one of the ways that the city’s looking at
combating this issue is through the process of rezoning locations. So one of the major if you guys are not
aware of the Jerome Avenue Rezoning Plan. They’re looking to rezone blocks along the Jerome Avenue
corridor. The purpose of this rezoning is to create more housing to create more economic development in
that area of the Bronx. This is not nothing new this whole rezoning process started with Bloomberg but
Bloomberg did it in a different way to really get his cronies into luxury housing in places like
Williamsburg and Astoria Queens, and downtown Brooklyn. What Mayor de Blasio’s Administration is
doing is really looking at this and saying as we have a homeless crisis issue we need to start looking at
certain neighborhoods and rezoning to create more housing and more economic development in some of
these neighborhoods. So that is a major rezoning proposal that encompasses Community Boards 4, 5 and
7. Community Board 4 voted on Tuesday night to approve it, Community Board 5 voted last night to
approve it and Community Board 7 is voting for it tonight. The reason why I bring this up I know it
doesn’t reflect here in this Community Board but it is something that is very monumental especially in the
Bronx you’ve never seen a rezoning at this scale.

So the Borough President is having a Public Hearing on this next week on Thursday November 2™ at the
Bronx Supreme Court Building Room 600 and it starts at 5:30. I brought some flyers and whether you
support this or not please come out to this Public Hearing we want to hear from as many folks as we can.
The Borough President will be making a decision on the rezoning on November 30"" that’s the last day of
the ULURP Application for the Borough President after that it goes to City Planning and then it goes to
the City Council Members for the final vote. This is sort of the way the city is trying in one way of
combating homelessness and looking at neighborhoods and rezoning them and attaching that together.

The representative from Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito’s Office said that we really don’t
have anything to report because we’re transitioning this is Melissa’s last year but everything is still the
same my office is going to stay. You know that Diana Ayala won the seat so we’re going to continue in
the same space so you will be able to find us.

You know Melissa is very close to Puerto Rico and we’re just hoping that we will be able to help them
because they are part of us and if they come down here we need to help them as much as we can. Any
questions or concerns you know where to reach me at 347 — 297-4922 and my office is located at 214 St.
Ann’s Avenue.

Pg. 6

The representative from the New York City Comptroller’s Office Scott Stringer said that some of
you may know me I was the Office Manager for Marcos A. Crespo but I now represent the Comptroller.
As you know the Comptroller is responsible for overseeing public pension funds. He’s also responsible
for making sure that city agencies are transparent and held accountable for the job that they’re doing. He
also wants to make sure that we continue to feel proud about the work that city government is doing and
there’s no other way to feel proud then in a room like this and now we’re all together here fighting for our
community. Most recently he said that he’s going to release a report where individuals will be able to
improve their credit scores.

reasons. Thisisa project that is a littledifferent from mostofthe projects. You can drivearoundthe
district and see many buildingsthat were built inlet'ssay inthe last fifteen years. This is aprojectthatPg.3
we'rereally looking forward to I've been coming to this community fortwenty somethingyears now and
we always talk aboutthe projectswe have fordevelopment inthis area particularly ifthere's a ULURP
Application which isthis case. This isasite which Ithink everyoneknowsthe history there wasa school
building that had to beclosed manyyears ago itwas deteriorating itgot to thepointthat itwas insuch
badshape thatthe BuildingDepartment issues an Emergency Declaration that iteither hadto be fixed or
torn down and itwas not financially feasibletodo that so itwas tom down. Ashas happened inmany
places around yourdistrict and other parts ofthe South Bronx. Outofadversityoutoftragedycame an
opportunityand we decidedthat itwould beagreat locationto buildanaffordablehousing buildingthis
happens inmany, many parts of yourdistrict. We came andspoke tothe Committee atthe time we then
did a Request for Proposalswhichwe usuallydo forcity owned property and we wantedsomething
special. It's gotten to the point where a lotofthebuildings that are being developed like inMelrose
Commonsyou knowjustupthe block. There was a story years ago that affordablehousingdidn'thave to
look like affordablehousingand Ihaveto say that Dattner was the first to makeaffordablehousinglook
different look more attractive. But it's gotten tothe point now that the buildingsbuiltinthe lastten and
fifteen years are starting to look a lotalike and so we felt this location right onthe Grand Concoursejust
down the block fromthe subwaystation near buses easy access LincolnHospitalacross thestreet from
HOSTOS CommunityCollege near highways walking distanceto aMetro-North station thatthiswould
beagreat location todo somethinga littledifferenta littlebitofa show piece. Sothis building will
certainly not look likemost oftheaffordable housing that has beendone intheareathe Architects will
explaina littlebetterand the DevelopmentTeam.
It's goingto incorporatesomethingcalled Passive House design which issomethingdifferent it's going to
bea littletaller than many ofthe buildings intheareabutyouknow this issomethingthat's goingon all
overthe city and you know the Bronx should be partofthetwenty-first centuryarchitecturallyand we
think thatthis isa good exampleofdoingthat. It's going to have a rangeofincomeeligibilitythis
Administrationmore than any otherand I'vebeen around a longtime is incorporating into the new
buildings being built byour programs awide range ofincomeeligibilityso thatthere will beunits
available for peoplethatare low income, unitsavailableforpeoplethat are moderate income with
different levels in between. There's goingtobe different size ofcourse and we'llget into that. Sowe
think that this issomethingthat willreally liven upthe area there, itwill create activity it's alwaysgood
to have more street activity. Youknow when HOSTOS is closedthat blockas longas it isas bigas it is
there's notmuch goingon there this will add activitytothat street. One ofthe other things asmany of
youknow rightnext door to thesite isaplayground which has beenclosed unfortunately foranumber of
years because it deteriorated itgot to be inbadshape andthe Parks Department feltthat they had to close
itdown and wespoke tothe Parks Departmentand the two agencies have been workingtogetherand
workingwiththe DevelopmentTeamand we havesomebody here from the Parks Departmentwho will
talkabout thatas wellthat along withtheconstructionofthisbuilding that playground is going to be
rebuilttotallyand reopenedasa Park. So what the community will be getting isnot only the new
building butthey will begettingthereopened Park madeavailabletothe community. So we'rereally
excitedaboutthis project one that we think is really goingto have a positive impact inadditionto making
available more affordablehousing.
Mr.Thomas BrownTrinity Financialsaidthat Ioversee development for our companyout ofourNew
York office. Trinity Financial isa RealEstate Development Company that's been developing affordable
housingthroughoutthenortheast forcloseto30 years. Onthis particular425 Grand Concourseproject
we're partnering with a local development organization MBD Development with Derrick Lovett and
Ruby Rodriguezand we feelthat we have avery exciting project. Our company was builton
collaborations with the localities that we developinand we treat 425 nodifferently. So we'd liketoPg.4
introduce the project andourselves. We'regoing togiveyouanoverview of theprojectandat end asTed
mentioned willanswer any questions. So I'lljust turn itoverto ChristophStumpout ofour office it's his

A power point presentation was provided
Mr. Christoph StumpTrinity Financial saidthat sofor 425 Grand ConcourseThomas introduced the

Just aquick overview whoever is not familiar with thesite it's about29thousand square feet vacant loton
144th StreetandGrandConcourseand we'reproposing to builda28·story buildingwith approximately
322 thousand square feetofbuilding. The main purpose ofthe building isto provide foraffordable
housing. The buildingcurrently has 289 affordable units we have a mix ofstudios,one,two andthree
bedroom units. The non-residential components we havea Medical Urgent CareCenter inthe building,
we have Retail space,we have a sizable educational facility and a cultural facility all located inthisone
building. We want to make itascomprehensiveand fully equippedfor this locationas possible. We
anticipatethe construction to start inDecember20I7the end ofnext year itwill bea 2year construction
process.
Wewere askedtoquicklyspeak to the ULURPaction we will come before you again inthe spring. So
you'rethe Land Use Committee andTedalreadymentioned it's aLand Use issue and we'reapplying for
rezoning fromthe currentC4-4 to C63 part ofthe ULURPTed mentioned thattherewill besomeText
Amendments totheZoning Resolution and the site will bea Mandatory Inclusionary siteother thanthat
we'renotaskingforany zoning variances. Thisbuildingis avery passivegreenbuildingTed mentioned
Via Verdea ground breaking buildingand that ithad anumberofvery greenfeaturessimilarto here.
This is goingto bea passive house building. We haveanairtight envelopewhich meansthattheair
inside the unitswill have to be replaced with mechanical freshair. Nobody knows betterthan youhow
plagues the SouthBronx iswith asthma coming from truck traffic from the highways an so this filter
system allowsa very clean environment it's very good for people who sufferunderasthma it'sa real
problem inthe South Bronx. It'savery quiet interiorspacean interiorthat isalsocapsulatedfrom your
neighboryou won'thave cookingsmells fromyourneighbor it'savery high building standard that we are
comingfor notjust forthe residential portion but alsoforthenon-residential aspects forthe building. We
will go for NYSERDAgrants multi-family program it's anactive and healthy buildingand we aretrying
to incorporateanumberofresilienciesand we want to besolar ready for the future. This isthebuilding
just togiveyouanoverview we'reon I44th Streetand we have Hosts CommunityCollegeover hereand
this isa rendering fromthe oppositesideon 144th Street GrandConcourse. Thereason whywe're
showing Hosts Community College is becausethere's actuallya park between Hostsand this projectsite
the GarrisonPark. Part ofthis proposal isthe renovation ofGarrisonPlayground and toprovidea
pedestrian connectorbetween GrandConcourseand WaltonAvenuewhich would be located nexttothe
project. Otherthan that we havea cultural facility on the northeast corner,we havethe Urgent Care
Center onGrandConcourse,the residential entrance is onGrand Concourse,retailon the cornerand the
school entrance onthe back ofthe building. Iwant to pointoutthat we're not closingthe buildingoffto
this pedestrian connectorbut it'satransparentdesign hereto provide somesecuritysense ofconnection toPg.5
the park. Here's asectionthrough the buildingto understand betterwhere the usesare located. What
we're trying to do is provide ahost ofcommunity beneficial non-residential uses to the community that
really enliven this section ofthe Grand Concourse and creates acommunityspacethat currently isn't
there. A quick view ofthepedestrian connector. Asyourecall onthis site thee used to be PS3land
duringthe demolitionsome artifacts were preservedand wewant to createa displayonthepedestrian
pathway with these artifacts. Just to create a senseof place and also make these artifactsaccessibleto
Everyoneto the public putting them somewhere inanenclosed space. Inthe RFP we feltthatthis wasan
importantfeature.
Withthefloor plans I'm not goingtogo into too much detail wewillhavea community space inthe
northwestern portion ofthe building,double loaded apartments. Something hereto note is ourresidential
corridor has awindow an importantresiliency feature for us. Ifyou don'thave windows inthe corridors
it can become dangerous. Oftentimesyouhaveenclosed corridors that can becomean unsafe
environment. This is arenderingby night itshows again our ideaand really ourconcept to provide for a
lot ofactivity inthis buildingand to make itas safeas possible. This isanactivebuildingandwe want to
provide theneighborhood with anumberofservices,securityandacomfortableneighborhood. Withthis
I'm going to turn thisback toThomas he's going to speak aboutthe affordable apartment levels.
Mr. Thomas BrownTrinity Financial saidthat we lookat thisas a mixed income project and as such
we wanted to providea distribution ofaffordability through a number of AMI tiers goingdown from30
up to 100percent AMI and it's distributed throughoutour project. So we're building for notonly low
income orvery low and there are anumberoftiersdependingonaffordability. Wecan provide the Board
withachartthat goes intodetail on familysizes it'sa large chart. But Ican tellyou that theranges go
from30 percent AMIonaone person inastudio an example would bethat individualwould beat $19
thousand and the example ofone person inan 100percent AMI unitapproximately $63 thousand and
bringing itdown to afamily offour for instancethat would be $38thousand ina30 percent tier up to
$90,600 ina 100 percent tier. So pretty much the range ofthe project would fallbetween that. Again our
intentwiththis project isto really meet the full needs ofthe Bronx. We've heard and I'm aNew Yorker
and understand there's aneed for both extremely low income housing and also middle income housing for
professionalsthat may be inthe area. Soagain that's out intent on the project. We are alsocommittedto
securingand improvingGarrison Playground right nexttoour development.
Mr. Nick Molinari ChiefofPlanningfor the New York CityParksDepartmentsaidsothis isour
design forGarrison Park which you guys sawback inMarch. Weannounced that we were moving along
with design GarrisonPark inDecember oflastyear. We had our community input meetingOctober of
last yearworked out allthe design kinks andcame up withadesign that we think works pretty well. It
has a multi-purposeplay area here, syntheticlawnspace playequipment forsmallerchildrenand older
children,spray showeraplaza spacethat alsohas awaterfeature here, fitnessequipment, gametables.
Really it's a site that wethink is goingto function for lots ofdifferent members ofthe community.
Everyoneknow that thepark has been closed for quitesometime. It's areally interesting layout ofa site
thereasonit looks the way itlooks isbecausethetrain runs right underneath itwhich isone ofthethings
thathas made this quiteacomplex park to work on but that'salsowhy ithas a lotof retainingwallson
the side. Right now itonlyhas entrances fromthis walkwayand one ofthe thingsthat we'veadded in is
additional entrancessothis is going to bea much more accessiblesite and a much more inviting site.Pg.6
Intermsofschedule forthe project so we starteddesignlast Octoberand it'stypicallyayearlong process
design itjustwrapping up. Then we will beenteringthe procurement process basically procuring and
reviewing allthe contracts and then hiringthe Contractor who is going to be doingthe construction work.
Theconstructionworkwill take approximately oneyear. Soconstruction isanticipatedtostart inlate
summerof next yearandto wrap upthe summerofthe following year.
Mr. Thomas Brown Trinity Financialsaidthat the fundingonthe project andallthe elementswe've
talkedaboutthe passive house the hi-rise nature ofthebuildingwe're working with HPO through their
funding program aswell asother funding sources. The total development costof this project asof right
now is projected at $140 million. Theapproximate distributionwouldbe $95 millionon thehard costs
whichwould beconstructingthe building and $45 millionon softcost which would beassociated costs.
Right now ourprojected fundingsources areTax Exempt Bonds from HPO, asubsidyfromHDC, Equity
raised from saleofLow-Income Tax Credits onthe project and we'realsolooking for Redo a Funds from
various parties within the City Council, Borough President and we're also putting inDeveloper's Equity.
We'vemadeachangetoourManagement Team onourRFPwe went inwith Wavecrest and based onour
feedback we're makingachangeto that so we're removing Wavecrestand going througha process now
to identifya suitableagent for the project.
To sumthis upit'sa mixed income project that we've put a lotofeffort into internallyand workingwith
ourpartners with HPO incoming up witha project that hasdiverse communitycomponents. Based on
the design we want to provideactive, vibrant ground floor uses onGrandConcourse, Walton Avenue and
East 144thStreet. We're buildinga passive house that isvery energyefficientthiswould bestate-of-the
art greenbuilding. Thiswould beunlike any buildingbuilt orconceived for mixed income housingto
date we havea distinctivearchitectural design on the project. As an organization both TrinityandMBO
havecommitmentofemploymentofMWBEentities, workers and businesses. Ithink that this isa very
innovativeproject that willbe of value tothe community.

Public Session
Morris Heights Health Center
Ms. Shannen Arroyo Senior Community Liaison said that for most of you know Morris Heights Health
Center is a federally qualified health center non-for-profit that has been around since 1981. We have now
8 health centers in the Bronx and 20 school based health clinics. What I have for you all is our July
community events calendar and I have the sites that I work for which is St. Ann's on 137th Street, Cypress
and Melrose on 158t11 Street. So I have information on all the services we provide. We also implemented
a Patient Advisory Group for our patients and for the community for whoever is more than welcome to
become part of the council and speak on behalf of what they want to see in our community.
New York City Department of Education
Mr. Adolfo Figueroa said that this is my second time I was here for Pre-K for All from the Mayor's
Office through the Department of Education. But here I am with 3-K for all we've seen the success with
the Pre-K initiative and we see that a lot of the community members appreciate that enthusiasm for Pre-K.
so now the initiative is for 3-K and will start in District 7 as well as District 23 in Brooklyn these two
districts are going to be the initiators for Three-K for All. The children attending free full-day 3-K will be
able to grow, learn and explore the world around them. I have some palm cards here and also some cards
with the website. Parents can go into the website and request for one of us to give them a call and helpPg.2
them to fill the application for some of the programs. There's about 13 different program schools many
that will be hosting the 3-K for All and from a lot of parents we have already received numerous ·
applicants and if it wasn't for you guys that continue to spread the word here in the community we
wouldn't be able to launch this so quickly this September. I don't know if any of you remember the
Mayor announcing it a few months ago. We obviously have more applications coming in and the
deadline will be July 14th for this 3-K for all program as well as for the Pre-K. There are some schools
that still have available seats for the 3-K program_s o if you hear of any family that the child was born in
2014 they can still continue to call us at the Department of Education to try and find them a seat.
New York City Department of Education
Ms. Glennis Gomez Special Outreach High School Admissions Specialist said that the City when it
comes to Mayor Bill de Blasio and Carmen Farina the Chancellor have announced in previous months
new initiatives to increase diversity at specialized High Schools. These initiatives are basically to provide
more free tutoring for low-income students and also to expand the scope of the Discovery Program. The
Specialized Schools Admissions Test which is the exam for eight Specialized High Schools. The eight
Specialized High Schools in New York City are the following the Bronx High School of Science; the
Brooklyn Latin School; High School for Mathematics, Science and Engineering at the City College of
New York; High School of American Studies at Lehman College; High School for the Sciences at North
College; Staten Island Technical High School; Stuyvesant High School and also LaGuardia High School
which is a performing arts school. Every eight grade student that is now in public school takes the
Specialized Admissions Test when they are in the eighth grade. Every single eight grade student is
mandatorily required to apply for High School but the Specialized High Schools on the other hand is an
additional option that they have it is not mandatory. For them to apply to the Specialized High Schools
they must take this test the Specialized High School Admissions Test. The Department of Education is
working really hard to promote the Dream Program which is a twenty-two month program that provides
test prep for these students when they are in their sixth and seventh grades. So the Department of
Education is continuing to work extremely hard by visiting about fifteen schools within the fifteen
districts that are underrepresented within the Bronx, Queens and Manhattan and we go to the school and
we do power point presentations to explain the enrollment process and the options that families have.
I'm here today because I would like to connect with any community organization or any community
advocate when it comes to education or that works with the youth so that I can either visit your
organization or I can either work with you so that we can continue to promote the importance of these
Specialized High Schools with the options that students have in the sixth, seventh and eighth grades. Part
of the lack of diversity in the Specialized High Schools is because our families are underrepresented in
our districts and do not have this information. This is not something that you can say that culturally is
spoken in our homes while many other ethnic groups are preparing their children beyond fourth, fifth
grade. This is very important and much credit to Mayor Bill de Blasio and Carmen Farina the Chancellor
for making this initiative and providing employees like myself so that we can come out to the
communities and provide this information. I have these brochures in both Spanish and English. I just
want to mention something quickly we had for the first time a Specialized High School Fair in the Bronx
and one in Brooklyn a few months ago and about 2,500 families attended the one in the Bronx and in
Brooklyn about 1,800 so work is being done and I am here so that you can forward this message to family
members and any youth that you think can benefit from this.
Questions and CommentsPg.3
Police Officer Hector Espada said thank you for all the love I've gotten throughout the years and for
welcoming me to your neighborhood. At the end of the day I consider it my neighborhood but it's yours
but thank you for embracing me and making me part of your community.
Third Avenue and 149th I don't know if you've seen it's being cleaned up slowly but surely we are trying
our hardest. The problem is ladies and gentlemen I have very good news and very bad news situation
Melrose and 149th is being cleaned up I went tod~y and thought that I was in a different BID location the
problem is that these individuals are now going to St. Mary's Park. We can't get rid of them we can
relocate them we are also Police Officers and cannot violate people's rights. So we have to do it the right
way to try and get these individuals help obviously a lot of them decline this help so we're trying to work
together with the community to get them help. I know a lot of the community say arrest but we're here to
help these individuals they have a disease they have a habit and need help. So please bear with us we've
cleaned up 149th and now we're concentrating a little bit more on St. Mary's Park because unfortunately
they're using it to do their activities. It might sound crazy what I'm about to say they're not bad people
they just make bad choices. So at the end of the day I know my Father was one so maybe that's why I
have compassion when it comes to individuals like that. Som ofus have had relatives that have fallen
down that path. I think this is going to be a great summer we have--Na · ma! Night Out August 1st on
Brook Avenue between 138th and 137th . The Halloween Event me and Gabe are still working on it we're
going to try and have it in front of the Precinct and maybe if everything goes well we might make the 40th
into a haunted house. So 99 percent of you have my cell phone number so please if you have any issues
or concerns please contact me. We're trying to be more in tuned to what the community needs.
Another thing we did arrest the six individuals that assaulted he vendor on 149th and Third A venue. It
was definitely a great job that the Detectives did. As far as the Mosque I don't know if anyone heard I
guess there were some kids with bb guns we have twenty-four hour police presence at the corner of the
Mosque to ensure that this doesn't occur again and just to make sure that everyone is safe at the end of the
day. We also have a sky watch right down the block.

Chairman and District Manager's Report
Public Hearing was opened by the District Manager
The District Manager read the description of the ULURP Application on the Special Harlem River
Waterfront District Expansion for the Public Hearing.Pg.4
The District Manager introduced Mr. Oscar Oliver-Didier Senior Urban Planner at the New York City
Department of City Planning making the presentation on the Special Harlem River Waterfront District
Expansion.
Mr. Oscar Oliver-Didier said that this presentation is based on what was certified and presented in front
of the Commission at the beginning of this month, on June 5th • But it's important to note that actually you
guys have been heavily involved in this project for more than a year now and actually say this way before
the Commission did. Again we value input but we wanted to update you and obviously present this for a
vote for you tonight.
Power point presentation
The application before you is the Department of City Planning Special Harlem River Waterfront District
and Expansion area. You sort of see here the geography and again this is going to be in District 1 in the
Lower Concourse area of the Bronx you sort of see the blue star there. The New York Department of
City Planning is proposing both a Zoning Map and text amendments to-J1umber one to update 2009
Special Harlem River Waterfront District regulations and this is the area in orange it's an existing district
we'll be amending a few of the regulations that exist and the expansion itself which is what's up here
tonight as a voting item. Again expanding the Special District to actually extend the access water plan
south and you sort of see it there Park A venue and see how it sort of abuts the Third A venue Bridge and
obviously it's the Harlem River to the west. I would add that the yellow item on top is actually the EDC
led project that was certified in April and they've come here to present as well even though that lies in
Community District 4. In this even though it's a stand-alone and separate application at the end of the
process it would become the north sub-district of again the Special Harlem River Waterfront District.
So the goals of the Zoning Map and the Zoning Text Amendments are the following one to update the
Special Harlem River Waterfront District to number 1 create flexible building form to encourage the
development of affordable housing; number 2 address easements and other restrictions that we've
recently discovered in the area; and finally meet flood resiliency needs. Then for the expansion area we
will be expanding the Special District to encompass two waterfront blocks to the south. In the end we
would address unique conditions to ensure lively accessible waterfront open space. So in the end it's
important to note that this Special District was created as part of a broader rezoning back in 2009 you see
the totality of it in blue. But the Special District itself one is sort of the orange abutting the Harlem River
itself. For the expansion area what you sort of see there with the dotted line just south of it is inside the
Port Morris/Bruckner rezoning which actually occurred in 2004. In terms of the existing zoning and land
use here the Harlem River Waterfront is zoned for mid-density commercial and residential uses and the
expansion area to the south currently is zoned for light industrial and residential. It's important to note
that number 1 in this Harlem River Waterfront there is a Voluntary Inclusionary Housing Program again
to promote the creation of affordable housing. It's also important to add that we're not changing the
zoning district as part of this process. Will see that the amendments do not change the zoning or the
heights it's really about sort of improving the Waterfront Access Plan and making sure that the kind of
development we have in the Special District makes sense. In terms of the area which you obviously know
very well it's an area with important institutions such as Lincoln Hospital, Hostos College among many
others, there's good access to transit trains and bus lines obviously there are a lot of existing NYCHA
communities and actually a lot of recent amount of affordable housing development. But it's important to
note that since 2009 we really have not seen any development occur within the Special District boundary
here shown in red. In terms of the place itself the Special District boundary which are illustrated here in
orange and red it sort of helps understand that this sort of lies next to Manhattan water side you sort of see·--·-··- -- ------ - - -------- ------~
··- ····
Pg. 5
the Harlem River and then the Special District area and the surrounding community connected by bridges.
The area is obviously straddled with other buildings on both sides. In the immediacy of the Special
District the dash line we see here the Special District is sort of straddled between the Major Deegan
Expressway and between the Oak Point Railing which is on the water's edge which is a freight line along
the shoreline. You sort of see on the left the elevated Major Deegan Expressway and you see on the right
the Oak Point Railing water side so these are sort of infrastructural challenges that must be taken into
consideration as part of this process. Also somet~ing that has changed its sort of like an added challenge
what was originally created in 2009 is that we've actually learned a lot about resiliency post Sandy. It is
important to note that the majority of the existing and proposed Harlem River Waterfront is in the one
percent annual flood risk zone. So in the end a lot of the regulatory environment around resiliency has
really changed as well and must be taken into consideration.
As I was saying earlier in terms of easement we have now a better understanding of easements and on
buildable areas that lie inside that sort of core sub-district which you see here in orange and that northern
edge right below 145th Street Bridge you sort of see how we have a significant amount of easements then
we have more knowledge of and you sort of see a DBZ easement t)lere but if you were to try to build
something in that particular parcel you see how constrained and pinched it would be. But there's others
and there's room for opportunities and there's new opportunities that have been appearing recently for
example the Lower Concourse Investment Strategy where the Mayor allocated $194 million dollars for
the area in 2015 as part of an investment strategy that includes Lower Concourse north, the development
of the new Harlem River Park and that includes acquisition, design and construction and street and
intersection improvements on Exterior Street which we all know is very important to ensure that the
community is able to access the waterfront. Finally investment strategies for commercial broadband
access in the area. Again all of these area a catalyst for affordable housing but also for improved access
and job growth.
So jumping back to the 09' Special District and the goals that were set back then was to ensure
development of a human scale guarantee variety of buildings and a varied skyline maximize waterfront
views and facilitate a strong street scape encourage eyes on the street and safety that people are sort of
looking out for each other ensure a range of uses on the waterfront to ensure its active and people have a
destination to go to and finally to encourage people to use waterfront holding spaces. It's important to
note that all of these goals are not changing they're still the basis of what we're working with and we're
presenting to you tonight.
So the 09' Special District this just like a brief overview of what that Special District entails. So you see
that it included 9 parcels included a Waterfront Access Plan which includes a 40 ft. shore public walkway
along the shore line it included visual corridors it included uplink connection so that you could actually
get to the water and included supplemental public access area which is sort of open spaces that occur
along the waterfront area itself. But for development there it sort of requires active uses in rent parking
regulations, tower locations, and controlled height and then the mapped park which we were talking about
just a few slides ago.
So in terms of the updates that we're doing to the Special District first of all we're providing building
vault variety and design flexibility for that development and again this is all to encourage the
development of possible affordable housing; number 2 we're providing flexibility on parcel one which we
saw earlier,with all the easements to accommodate these; number 3 we're requiring ground floor active
uses and rent parking only on key locations; and finally we're allowing greater options for resiliency
design. Again this is all for the geography here shown in orange.····----- - - --- -------------------- --------- -----.
. ····-- --
Pg.6
So about bulk and what we're doing in amending regarding bulk this is the existing bulk of the Harlem
River Waterfront. So if someone were to build in this area as of now this is what you would get 60 to 85
ft. base heights with a tower above with some control height that ranges in distance and then you would
have a required variation of street wall height. As part of the amendments that we're proposing we are
lowering heights along the shoreline and again to make it more to a human scale something that feels
more inviting. We're maximizing also the use of the waterfront you see we sort of have those U-shaped
buildings to ensure that residents have visibility apd better views of the waterfront itself. Then more
importantly we're providing the flexibility to support the development of affordable housing and how
we're doing that is by providing more options and the possibility of hybrid scenarios. For example you
sort of see here in yellow under the new updates there's a better possibility of incorporating block and
plank construction which is more typical of affordable housing but we're also permitting and you could
also create a building that's entirely a block and plank construction and could fit more affordable housing
units and you sort of see it here on the lower left and how we're achieving that also with more details in
terms of the height you sort of see fronting the shorefront walkway all the measurements in red the height
ranges from zero to 85 ft., there would be a required opening you sort of see sort of a U-shape part of the
development that's going to go from zero to 45 ft. and then finally 125 maximum transition height.
Lowering the heights on the waterfront just so it feels more inviting for the people who are walking along
there. But 50 ft. from the shore public walkway where we actually feel more comfortable with height we
have a base height that ranges from 50 ft. to 105 ft. and a maximum transition height of 155 ft. above that
you have the towers and as part of this proposal we're simplifying the tower walls and giving more design
flexibility and again this all for floor plate efficiency. Important to note as we've said earlier we're not
changing the tower heights at all as part of this process.
So this is sort of what we get this is the vision of what we're trying to see here occur. You sort of see in
this image how development sort of steps down towards the water and then you also see how you're
getting full variety. It's also achieved again for the sake of that visual variation that we want to promote.
So in terms of the easements themselves we're seeing the slide of earlier you sort of see how the 2009
requirements and these include the visual corridor of the connections shorefront public walkway we're
really sort of pinching the possibility of seeing an efficient floor plate of a development actually occurring
here. So what we're doing actually is removing a requirement that was placed in 09' an aligning and
mapping an upland connection which is actually better because it's actually a route for people to get down
to the water and we're shifting a public supplemental access area to the north where actually we feel it
makes even more sense because a lot of people are coming from 149th Street. In terms of the wrap use
and screening the current 09' rules had a requirement that ground floor parking that wrapped for uses
along the shore public walkway the area fronting the shoreline to park and the current requirements
supporting they are 100 percent wrap requirement these parcels are not particularly deep they're pretty
regular actually and there's also screening requirements that require parking screen at ground floor level.
What that means is that you have landscaping, vegetation that would buffer any sort of blank wall you
would never see parking from the streetscape. So as part of this process what we're doing is we're
keeping the 100 percent wrap use requirement fronting the shore public walkway parcels one and two and
then for the other areas we're still keeping the wrap use requirement but it's going to be 50/50 so you
have a nice variation of landscaping and shrubs and trees and that sort of thing and also the wrap use
which could be sort of a retail or community facility use. Important to note however that the active uses
that we were just saying that include retail and include community facility we're sort of requiring them
now to be in specific areas most importantly these would occur in specific corridors of the development
where people would be coming down towards the water. So in those particular geographies we want to
make sure that people feel that it's sort of active and safe frontage before you reach the water instead of
like a blank wall or something that's inactive and you sort of see them in red here and how they're going
to be placed in the Special District itself. You sort of see here a view of how it could look like fromPg. 7
Exterior Street with some of those active uses and landscaping requirements but also affecting the
streetscape is resiliency itself. So in terms of resiliency the design filtration in this area ranges from two
to eleven ft. in this district so it's very likely that as part of the new requirements buildings would be
raised really to sort of like promote flood protection so this could actually encourage blank walls on sort
of the adjacencies and surroundings of these buildings and right now the only underlying requirement for
these are plantings. What we're doing is providing both group and requiring more design elements for
blank walls that are taller than 4 ft. and these sort_o f design limits could include planting, seeding, lighting
and bike racks. But you also see how the street wall is creating more room for things such as ramps,
stairs so it really does create a more visual variety while still keeping the area safe and resilient. Really
this is sort of what you would get and what you would see when you're walking along the shore public
walkway something-that feels active its resiliency and its sort of promoting a safe public route.
So on to the expansion area which is actually the boundary that we're seeing here in red and it's where
we're promoting the expansion of the Special District. So again the reason why we're expanding is to
address the existing conditions and ensure a lively and accessible waterfront open space. You sort of see
here the visual that we just saw earlier.to remind you folks of the specific area we're talking about there in
sort of a dash pink you sort of see it from the north as well and we""lilust be reminded that in this area
these two waterfront blocks are straddled by both the Oak Point Railing and by the Deegan Expressway.
So the expansion area now is a large waterfront block with independently owned lots making waterfront
access very challenging. So the Waterfront Plan what it will do is allow is to customize access and
address some of these unique conditions. It's important to note that what we will be showing now a plan
that was formed by a lot of public outreach included a lot of members here at this table that was
conducted last year during the summer and this is sort of what we're proposing so in essence what we're
doing is breaking up that block to provide proper access. Instead of having this landlocked huge
waterfront block breaking it up and making it feel more a part of the existing neighborhood and how
we're doing that is incorporating and putting in place upland connections which you see here in sort of
light blue. There's an existing inlet that's actually there you see it's sort oflike a U-shape. An existing
inlet that not many people know it's there but now will be sort of accessible you'll be able to get there
from some of these surrounding and adjacent streets. We've also sort of place a supplemental public
access area so it creates a nice open space in that area as well. As part of the process of this Special
District we would require active uses in certain quarters. So again to make sure that when development
occurs you would have a safe an active environment while you're walking down towards the street.
So in conclusion the proposed changes to the Special District area and its expansion zone will encourage
number one the development of affordable housing by creating flexible building form; number two
address easements and restrictions but meet the flood resiliency needs and finally would address
conditions to ensure accessible open space on the river waterfront.
Questions and Comments
The Chairman called for a roll call vote on the Special River Waterfront District and Expansion
Zone.
The roll was called with IO-yes, 4-abstentions and 4-no votes. The item passed.
Public Hearing ClosedPg.8
Mr. Oscar Oliver-Didier said that I'm also here to present a Zoning Text Amendment that involves
obtaining a special permit for self-storage facilities. The city understands that self-storage facilities have
generated concern among communities and industrial advocates. Like many the city wants to support
industrial jobs in Industrial Business Zones or IBZ's as we know them and then proposing to strike a
balance in the city's most active industrial areas and the real demand that exists in this city for self
storage which is already limited as to where they can locate in New York City. So where did this come
from and where did this proposal originate. In N9vember 2015 just over 1 year ago the Office of the
Mayor and the City Council Speaker announced a IO-point Industrial Action Plan that targets New York
City's Industrial Business Zones the IBZ's as areas of employment growth and industrial innovation. The
Industrial Action Plan has three main objectives one to protect industrial neighborhoods and incentive
development which again includes to limit personal storage in IBZ's to support economic growth; number
two align city services to help industrial business start, grow; and thrive, and finally to train the city's
workforce to meet the need of the sector.
Now in terms of the IBZ's themselves in the Bronx you see that in the southern end in Port Morris you
have an Industrial Business Zone. So and IBZ or Industrial Business Zone are New York City's most
active industrial areas with over 68 percent industrial-sector employment; critical for a range of
industries: wholesale, trade, transportation & warehousing, manufacturing and construction; and more
importantly since 2010 industrial employment is actually growing in IBZ's. So what the Industrial
Action Plan builds is on a series of existing policies tax incentives, service provision, a pledge not to
rezone IBZ's for residential use, and again support the economic growth that occur in these business
zones.
So the proposed restriction on self-storage makes sense in this context of a clear development policy for
IBZ's. So this is how we're sort of calling these areas in the IBZ's where these special permits shall
apply. So we're calling them the proposed designated areas in M-Districts one reason we're calling it that
way and not an IBZ for the purpose of the Zoning Text Amendment we will call the IBZ Designated
Areas. We're giving them a different name because we need to incorporate boundaries into the Zoning
Resolution which are based on the mapping conventions of zoning. We want to make sure that the
boundaries and the Zoning Resolution are not confused with the existing tax program. That's what an
IBZ is it's a Tax Program which will continue to operate in an independent manner the Zoning Resolution
does not control tax programs. Again it's a tax program to incentivize industrial jobs in the IBZ's. So
again it's just a technicality but I don't want to confuse people where we're calling these areas where the
special permit would apply are called the Proposed Designated Areas in Manufacturing. So the
boundaries created are created to conform with zoning practices and compared to IBZ's what they do is
exclude airports again it's not a place where you have self-storage it actually includes more areas then the
IBZ's themselves.
Self-storage itself we all know or we've seen it we kind of know how they operate and even some of the
things that we don't like about them. Here's a little background of what these uses area. The industrial
goals of the city from IBZ's are either job intensive, innovative, provide utilities and industrial services to
and/or support additional economic output. The unregulated development of self-storage detracts from
the city's long-term goals for an Industrial Business Zone for three principal reasons one that self-storage
does not generate many jobs; secondly it serves primarily households; and finally then tend to occupy
very large lots on designated truck routes or highways which often would be more optimal sites for more
job intensive industrial uses. In that respect self-storage combines these three characteristics_c onflicting
with the city's economic development goal for industrial business zones. So today's self-storage is
permitted in Mand CS districts restricting these facilities in IBZ's is necessary because we see that
industrial businesses are having a hard time finding appropriate sites and these large lots are increasinglyPg.9
sparse. Here are a few examples ofrecent sites in different parts of the city where self-storage
development has taken place. We think that in the context of the Economic Development Policy for
IBZ's there could have been a more job intensive on sites like this. These lots as you can see here are
very large and optimal location for trucks and businesses and the development of self-storage in such
locations is regarded as a lost opportunity. So you see there are two Bronx examples here they're not in
this district but we just wanted to show these one is in Throgs Neck and the other just north of Co-op
City. So you have an idea that this is sort of a citywide problem and a borough wide problem I would
add. So currently there are actually 240 facilities across the entity of New York City how they're
classified these self-storages currently they're classified as warehouses and currently permitted as-of-right
in CS and all M districts. More importantly is that one quarter of all self-storage facilities are actually in
Industrial Business Zones so you see the blue dots so you have sort of a broad idea where the self-storage
sites are located and in purple you sort of see citywide where all these IBZ's are. As you can see
Community Board 1 and 2 are the most impacted especially 2 but 1 has all the area of Port Morris over
here.
So looking in and zooming into the Bronx the most areas of culpability here would apply as follows so
the permit effects the areas in purple which is citywide one-third of all conforming facilities are in
designated areas in M districts and two-thirds of self-storage facilities have opened outside of IBZ's.
So we believe this proposal would be good for IBZ's because optimal industrial sites will be available for
more job intensive industrial businesses. Again the area where we would be limiting the growth of more
self-storage is actually in the IBZ's area.
So how would it work the proposed self-storage restriction work a CPC or City Planning Commission
Special Permit is proposed for the development of self-storage in designated areas in M Districts. A case
by-case, site specific review process will ensure that self-storage development doesn't represent a
significant lost opportunity for the future siting of an industrial more job intensive business. What it
basically means is that it's not that we're prohibiting self-storage in these IBZ's it's just that you have to
apply for a Special Permit and the City Planning Commission will look at it on a case-by-case basis.
Again if it's a site that would be more appropriate for different reasons for more job intensive industrial
use it would not get the Special Permit approved. So the restriction will apply only to self-storage and not
to other warehouses or moving businesses because those uses are much more job intensive they usually
have more staff. They need to have people driving the trucks moving the materials it's moving the actual
elements that's being transported. These are the businesses again that tend to have more employees and
serve businesses they are an important part of the functions of the industrial area where as self-storage
really isn't.
So the Special Permit has specific criteria on which a Special Permit will be permitted for self-storage
development on sites that are not appropriate for conforming industrial uses that the City Planning
Commission will evaluate based on such considerations as zoning lot size, lot configuration; proximity to
truck route; if the street is narrow or wide; has there been any investment in the area or comparable sites;
is there a potential for conflict between potential industrial uses; and finally is this proposed site
contaminated and is there a need for environmental remediation. So it's important to also note that
existing self-storage facilities will be permitted to remain and extend or enlarge within the original zoning
lot as of date of enactment. So existing self-storages will be grandfathered as part of this process. It's not
really that the one's we have right now will be driven out or abandoned it's really that you c~'t build
anymore unless you get again this Special Permit.Pg.10
So this is how this Special Application would work just to understand what your role with this would be
and the timing. So the Special Permit if you don't know is a discretionary action subject to full ULURP
review so an applicant will have to show that the potential site is adequate for self-storage and impractical
for industrial business. So the pre-application process means crafting land use and environmental
applications which takes an average of 15 months and afterwards ULURP the Land Review process
begins. As you all know the ULURP involves Community Board review, Borough President's review,
City Planning Commission review and usually th~ Council also votes on it. So again as we all know the
sort of length of the process for a CPC Special Permit is typically almost two years. So this again is in a
scenario where there's actually a site that we feel comfortable with a storage facility popping up because
maybe it's an area that's not ideal because it's irregular it's not close to adequate access for trucks and
that kind of thing so it's not really useful for industrial use and we don't' want to have an empty blighted
site so maybe we do feel comfortable with having a self-storage there. But having said that if they want
to proceed they would have to go through the full land use review process where's now they don't it's
build as-of-right.
So in terms of this specific Text Amendment we referred this ~oning Text Amendment in May and then
we're currently here and then a Borough Board and Borough Presrdentreview and then we would hold a
CPC Public Hearing and City Council would review. It's expected that this would be passed no earlier
than November.
Questions and Comments
Elected Officials Reports
The representative from the New York City Mayor's Office Bill De Blasio said that a few things I
want to talk about good news today the City passed the Mayoral control of for the Department of
Education at least for the next two years. I think under the Mayor's tutelage while he's been in office our
youth have done exceedingly well Universal Pre-K is an example Three-K is an example a high
graduation rate dropout rate is down to nine percent physical education for all advanced AP classes for all
and the list goes on and on I could talk about it all night but we do have two more years of Mayoral
control. Two she's handing out pamphlets for Benefits Access Campaign. It's a campaign that we've
launched we've looked at the numbers across the City out of 100 percent of people that are eligible for
benefits only 20 percent of the people actually take the benefits. We want to remove the stigma around
benefits you have a right to take benefits and we want to encourage that. We believe that in two years we
can narrow that down to the 95 percentile. If you know anyone who is eligible for benefits please direct
them to this information so we can be sure that they get it. Last but not least I want to direct you to a
website its rikers.cityofnewyork.us if you go to this website you will see the plan that the City and the
Mayor have to close Riker's Island. The City and the Mayor have committed to close Riker's Island but
it's going to take all of us it's going to take all of our help. It's going to take the help of the NCO
Officers, the Board, Precinct Councils, NYCHA Elected Officials, Council Members everyone. We
believe given the track record in the decrease in crime that we've had over the last five months and
believe it or not this is the safest New York City we've ever had.
Questions and Comments
The representative from the New York City Comptroller's Office Scott Stringer said that I just
wanted to talk briefly about the divestment in private prisons. So basically as we all know private prisonsPg.11
the industry is morally bankrupt they make more money by putting more people in jail. So across the
country over 26,000 Americans are housed in roughly 135 prisons. Investigations have found that private
prisons have higher rates of security and safety incidences they put non-violent inmates in solitary
confinement because there's no space to put people sometimes and there's a lack of appropriate medical
care because it eats into profits. So as a result people are dying people are sick and this poses real risks of
lawsuits and financial losses for the City. So earlier this month the Comptroller announced that the New
York City Pension Funds are the first in the country to fully divest from private prisons. More and more
people are going to eventually go into the private prison system and we don't want to stand idly by it. So
we've sold all 48 million that we've invested in these companies. Then second the Comptroller is having
an Eid Al-Fitr celebration on Thursday, July 13th at DC 37 at 125 Barclay Street 6 PM. If you have any
questions or concerns I'm here.
The representative from the Congressman Jose E. Serrano's Office said that I just have a couple of
announcements we have a couple of events in the summer going on first and foremost we want to do a
Veteran's Resource Fair it's going to be going on August 30th a._t the Bronx VA Hospital from 12 to 4 PM.
We're also going to do off-site hours it's a time when we host homs that are not the regular 9 to 5 PM.
We have five different moments and times when we will host these and they're going to be going on from
th
6 to 8 PM the dates right now are July 12th 18th, 26 and August 16th Last but not least we're going to
, .
have a Homeowners Legal Assistance Workshop 6 to 8 PM August 2nd at Kipps Boys School but its not
finalized but just to let you know that all these events will be going on. Our office always has the doors
open for any Federal issues you have or if you just want to come by and say hi.
The representative from the State Senator Jose M. Serrano's Office said that the Senator just recently
released is anti-gun violence legislation because as I'm sure you guys know President Trump has made it
clear that he is almost backtracking on almost all of the gun violence efforts that Obama has tried to
make. So the Senator has co-sponsored a bunch of bills which basically protect us here in New York City
all the bills are listed in this package. Last month we focused on Women's Rights and women's
empowerment during our off-site Constituent Hours Monday through Thursday at local Senior Centers. ,
But this month we focused on the LGBT community so they were able to come through and get some free
resources and information from some of the organizations that we partnered with. Next month will be
Veteran's History Month and Veterans Appreciation Month so we will be focusing on providing
resources to our veterans. Speaking of veterans the New York State Senate does have a Veterans Hall of
Fame and this year Senator Serrano inducted our very own Mr. Rodriguez into the Hall of Fame so a
round of applause for him. So if you guys have any questions you can feel free to reach out to our office.
The representative for the Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito said that I gave everyone a
newsletter of what we did and the events we went to everything is listed there. As you know this is her
last term so her days are numbered so whatever issues you have my information is on the flyer and
whatever you need and whatever we can help you with our office is open the hours are here so you can
call or come by and we will try to help you the best we can. We're very community oriented and we try
to help our constituents the best we can.

Chairman and District Manager's Report
Mr.Cedric 1..Lofting District Manager introduced Mr.OscarOliver-Didier Senior Urban Designer
New YorkCity DepartmentofCity Planning whowould be givinga presentationon the Special Harlem
River Waterfront District.
Mr.OscarOliver-DidierSenior Urban Designersaidthat Idowant to sharesomevisualswithyouon
the project we'redeveloping. This issomething that wasalready planned and sort of implemented in
2009. We really looking notonlyto do much needed amendments to the plan but also expanding itto
waterfrontaccess.
Asagain as Iwas mentioning this isreally a project that'saboutamendmentsand with theexpanding the
waterfrontaccess plan itself. It is importantto note that the date that we're proposing to certify this is
June Sth, we originally had a plan to certify this back inAprilhowever we really wanted to make sure that
we had everything to the level that we wanted to in termsofimplementation and so forth so we decided to
go with the June date instead. You'll see like the levelofengagement that we have inthe presentation
and we have acouple ofslides showing that. We reallysort ofhad some level ofengagement and
discussions witheven with someofyou folks here from the Community Board and other members from
the surrounding geography. This isthe geography ofthatarea we'retalking aboutthatareain orange is
Theexisting Special District itselfand what we're proposing as part ofthe actions is both a zoning map
and textamendmentto do two things one is to update the Special Harlem RiverWaterfront District
regulationandtheotherone isto expand thatdistrictand its waterfront accessplan. Just so that we know
where we arethatorange border sortofends upat 14Qd' Streetand this issortofred south district which
isthe expansion area is actually south ofPark Avenue this is sort ofThird Avenue Bridge hereand
coming up through there yousortofseethe Concourse youalso see Metro Northgoingup and through
149th • The area that's in yellow is actually a cityowned site. These aresortofthe two actionsthat are
sortofon the table and what we wantto do issortoftryto getcertified inJune this isnot a full ULURP it
is not a re-zoning Ibelieve the hearing when its scheduled is anoptional hearingso we will be glad to do
that when the date comes. Then moving on when we created this 09 SpecialDistrict we reallytook back
thensort ofunderutilizcd manufacturing usesthat wereon the waterfrontand sortofredeveloped it into a
mixed use areathat didthe following ensure development maintained humanscale,guaranteed varied
buildings and a varied skyline,and more importantly maximize waterfront views and facilitate a strong
streetscape and make sure that the street felt safeand accessible forpedestrians,residentsand community
members,ensuringa range ofuseson the waterfront itselfso thatyou would draw people into the
waterfront and finally encourage peopleto use openspaces thatwould be created as part ofthe
WaterfrontAccess Plan itself.
So as Iwas saying again this sort ofrezoning was partofa larger Concourse rezoningthattookplace in
09 yousee the SpecialDistrict itself in red was created backthen. Then theorange area was actually an
area that was rezoned back in04 into a mixed use district thatwas created in 1977. So really we are
expanding theAccess Waterfront Plan not rezoning to make sure that whatever happenstherebecause
theseare mostly private properties to ensure accessto the waterfront forexisting residents andcommunity
members. We knowthearea quite well we knowthe institutions Lincoln Hospital, Hosts College, the
transportationsystem 2 and 5on I49thStreetyou have the 4and 6 around 138thStreet. We've also been
getting a lot ofaffordable housing like in blue outlined thereacross thearea. To make sure thatwhen
development occurson the Harlem River Waterfront that there isnot onlyaccessibility to the water but
we also getaffordable housing as well. Very importantlytoo in 09 when this wasapproved super storm
Sandy had not occurred yet. Ibelieve there have been a lot ofchanges that occurred in terms ofcitywidePg.4
regulations regarding resiliencyand it'svery importantthat the rules we implemented in 09 sortofare
aligned with the new rules to see that thisarea and the adjacencies remain safe from future flooding.
When the Access Plan andthe Special District were crested we really wanted to hone inand understand
what was happeningonthe ground. Again you can see that there'stwo very important infrastructural
factors that currently impact ifyoucan accessor not the water. Currently the Major Deegan Expressway
creates a barrier one can say along Exterior Street to actually get to the waterand you see some ofthe
usesthat are there currently they'rewalled offand fenced offthey have storage areas and thatkind oruse
isnot publiclyaccessible. Thenonthe othersideassomeofyou may knowthere'sthe Oak Point rail line
that actually runs along the water. Getting againa lot ofchallenges ingetting to the water and what we
see when we getthere sothat's somethingthatwe alsotake into consideration as part ofthis Plan. This is
whatwe approved in 09 and youcan sortofsee the differentaspectsthat weresortofincorporated into
that Access Planand some visuals. Againthis isprivate development its'ssortofforeseeing what could
occurso creating specialrulesthat instead ofyoudoing whatyouwant we somehow controlhowyou
actually getthere. Theseare the thingsthat we put in place astoolsto be ableto achieve that. One isto
split upthe SpecialDistrict into parcelsand have specific controlsand rules foreachone and that includes
the Waterfront Access Plan. What the WaterfrontAccess Plan incorporatesor puts place isa 40 ft.
required shore line public walkway thatneed to be publicly acces-sible even though that may be on private
land.Guaranteed in termsofthat WaterfrontAccess Planyouhave to have visualcorridors whenyou're
walkingalong the streetwe don't wantblack walls to the water. Its fine ifit's private property it stillhas
to be accessiblethe waterfront is for all membersofthe community.
Uplandconnections makingsure that youactually getto the waternotonlysee it from Exterior Street but
getto the waterfrontand actually enjoy that 40 ft.publiclyaccessible walkway. Then supplemental
public accessarea itactually gets very specific each parcel has to comply with 20 percentoftheir sq.
footage has to be publicly accessible and iftheycan'tdo that orachieve that throughtheupland
connections and shore public walkwaytheyare obliged to provide extra space inan open area suchas a
park that again hasto be publiclyaccessible. Anotherthingthat we wanted to make sure was to require
active usesand wrap parking. Wrap parking is makingsure that ifthey place enclosed parking garages on
the groundfloorthat youcannot seethat from the waterfront. That itiscovered somehoweither through
screeningoruses such assmallcoffee shopsordifferentcommunity facilities. Then bulk regulations
makingsure thattowers are placed ina waythat do not obstruct views. That we have a constancy in
termsofthe base site how yourelate tothe buildings whenyou're inthose differentopen spaces. More
importantlyand this is somethingthatEDC is moving forward with intermsofacquiring the space and
developing it, it'sa mapped park between 144'""and 146'11 Streetyousort ofsee ittherejust southof
parcel I. So we would have thatnewpark right inthe middle Iwouldsay orthe northern edge ofthe
Harlem Waterfront District itself.
So whatare we looking to amend as part ofthe map amendments and textamendmentsone we would
update the Special Harlem Riverto createthe following thingsprovide flexible buildingformsto
encourage the developmentofaffordablehousing, it's reallyaboutconstruction methods. What
constructionmethodsare bestto incentivize affordable housingand ifwe only geta chance to put in place
towers then reallywe're not creating more space to actually have the possibility ofsomeone saying no I
want to create a buildingthat'sactually 100percentaffordable housingand that the constructionmethods
that do that isactually achievable here and we'recreatingsome rulesregarding that. We also wantto
create specialrules that actually make fora public walkwayto the waterfront itselfmore toa human and I
have visualsthat helpshow that. We also knowmore now abouteasements and restrictionsthese are very
challenging thereare easements regarding subways, sewereasementsthat really make itdifficult to fit
buildings inthere. So we're providing a bitofflexibility to make sure that we get the buildingand that
we get the open space that comes with it. As Imentioned before to make sure that we're meeting floodPg.5
resiliency needs. Then interms ofthe southern area theexpansion area itselfwe want to expand these
same rule the Special District rules that wouldsortofincorporate waterfrontaccess opportunitiesto the
waterfront blockjustsouthof itandthat sortofruns through Park and Third Avenue. Ijust remind folks
it'snota rezoning ofthisarea thisprocessdoes not include a rezoning itisthe current zoning will remain
completely intact.
Sothe core district itselfand when Isaythe core district it's again I'm pointing to thecurrent Special
District which is in orange. This is what we'redoing provide building blockoptions and flexibility that
incorporate non-toweroptions, youcanstilldo a toweron a base and incorporate affordable housingthere
but blockand plank isactuallya construction method that ismore likely to incentivize and create
affordable housing and that usually tapsand that'sjust because ofthe construction method it usually taps
at IS stories you can'tdo more because it's structurally not possible. Sowe wantto create the
opportunities thatyou can actually create thisenvelope here on the waterfront and actually encourage that
we getaffordable housing here. lalso wantto simplify tower rules it wasvery restrictive what we were
creating back in 09 we still wantto create that level ofvariety and articulationon the buildings we also
wantto make sure that people are ableto build housing here they're actually encouraged to build
affordablehousing have the flexibility to do so. As Iwas saying before actually one ofthe parcelsthat
has most oftheeasements in tenns ofsewerand subway easements isactually parcel Ijust south ofthe
145mstreet Bridge we're providing some flexibility intermsofwhere the parcel and how it could be
placed to make sure that its again creating the openspace requirements that they're sort ofobliged todo
butalso canactually buildthe mixed use buildingsthat we wantto see here and have envisioned since 09
occurring here. Then we wantto limitground flooractive usesto specific comers we really find the most
important placesto have active uses such as a coffee shop, a laundromat, a restaurant something that
really gives the eyesonthe streetto have people coming inand outofthem ison the comersbecause
that's whereyou going down to the water. So we wantto require againdevelopers to sort ofputthose
active uses more along the line ofmom and pop shopsand small retailstoresthat again can sortof
incentivize having people and havingthem come to thewaterfront area. Then allowing greateroptions
forresiliency. Although the current rules post Sandy oblige buildingsto beraised depending on the
specific flood elevation ofthatarea that's very important to do we want to make sure that this area feels
safe forvisitorsand residentsatthe same time we want to make sure also that they're not creatingadverse
impacts to that openspace. Inother words their raising the buildingswe don't want black walls we want
to make sure that they screen itwith planting, landscaping, seating, lighting stuffthat really makes this
place inviting and welcoming to the visitorsas wellastheresidents that would likely move here.
Then this issortofwhat we're sortofenvisioningagain this is sortofaquicksketch butyousortofsee
the before and yousee the after. This is sortofwhat Iwanted to tellyouaboutthe short public walkway
as well it's a bit small butyoucould sortofsee that the heightofthe shortpublic walkwaywas
incentivized back in 09 ranged from 60 to 85 ft. Nowwe're providing more flexibility in terms ofwhat
youcan actually do and we're lowering that base site inspecificareas and they can drop all the way down
to 30 ft.and evendropdown and create nice greenopen areas asyousortofsee here. You create that
variety as that sortoflooked atas something positive to have along the waterfrontand notsomething too
tallor burdensome to have in thatopenspace. In the meantime and in that process we also reduce
shadows in thatarea which again is where we want peopleto sortofbe and enjoythe public spaces that
would becreated there. Then the expansion area itselfand I'm wrapping up herewhich isthe redarea
that Iwasjust talking aboutearlier we'regoing to address unique conditionsto ensure livelyaccessible
waterfront openspace. It's important to note thatactually thisarea isjustone big waterfront block but
unfortunately it'scomposed ofmultiple independently owned lots so really it's verydifficultbecause
each ofthese peoplearedifferentowners. Again these areall private owners thatcandevelop right now
as-of-right. We wantto makesure thatwe incorporate similarrules for that Special District IjustPg.6
talkedaboutso that when theycome inthey're notonlythinkingaboutthemselves and how they're
providing access for the residents but also thinkingabouttoo how toget and draw peopleto the
waterfront. Sothis isthe geographythisArielkindofhelpsto seethe area itself. You see Lincoln
Avenue heretothe eastofthe proposed expansion area yousee againthe amenities like Hostosand
Lincoln Hospitalyoualso see similar infrastructure challenges suchas the Deegan Expressway which
kindof limits the accessibilitytothisarea and againsomeofthe Bridges that sortofgetyou into
Manhattan. A good thingthat Iforgot to mentionisthat Economic DevelopmentCorporationofNew
Yorkis actually investinga Jotofmoney inthisarea. So we're sort ofworkingtogetherto makesurethat
Exterior Street gets improved because it'skindofuseless ifyou're fixingand makingsure thatthe
waterfront is invitingand Exterior Street is not invitingas welland feels sortofsafe. They're investing
closeto$200milliondollars insortofdifferentsortof improvementsandthat includesthat Park and
buildingoutthat Park Ijust mentioned but also making surethatthe intersectionsto crossto the
waterfront feel safe because againthat's theonlyway we insurethatwhatever happens here iseasily
accessibleand feels welcomingsafeand invitingtothe existingcommunity intheadjacentareas.
We diddifferent sessions withcommunity membersand Board I was greatly involved with thisand
helped ussortofspreadthe word. This is probably the fourth or fifthtime we've been doing a
presentation regardingthis projectby now. Back in May of2016 we did a workshop with folks and from
what we heard fromthat and anothersurvey we conducted bothin person and some indifferent places but
alsoon line we got inputand that's sortofwhat we'reactually proposing inthisarea. Againvery similar
tothe rules youalready sawyou heard abouttheshort public walkway,the upland connection, the
supplementalpublic accessarea andthe visualcorridors all those same rulesthat applyinthe current
Special District would alsoapplyinthis geography. Takea look atthis quickdiagraphthat sortofheips
shows what I'm tryingto say. Rememberthat previousdiagraph Ihad thatprevious map itjust showeda
bigwaterfront land lock block. So whatthis istryingto do is break it upand make surethat we have
accessonto theshort public walkway. So you can imagine peoplecomingdown Exterior Streetorthis
sortofcontinuationofCanalStreet west but more importantly you can envisiona lot ofpeoplefrom a lot
ofthe residences inNYCHA inhere andcoming inthrough 1341hto make sure that they get tothe
waterfrontwhenthatdevelopment takes place. You couldalso sort ofsee the 40 ft.shorewalkwaya
supplementalpublicaccessarea. Idon'tknow ifsome folkshaveactuallyhad the chance to go there but
there's a nice natural inletandyoucouldactually imagine what it could be to have that accessible short
public walkway supplementalpublic area rightonthat sort of inletthat'sthere thatactually is important
to notthat'sthe portion mostdistance fromthe railline. That'sreally where youwantto draw peopleand
have themthereseparated fromthat train.
Finally,youhavesome ofthe active useswe werejust mentioning we want to makesurethat when
you'rewalkingthrough there it kindoffeels like the existing streetseape they're walkingthrough stores
passed a community facility into somethingthat sort offeelssafe and invitingsomething that is sort of
land locked andexclusive tothe residents that arethere.
So, inconclusionas part ofthe changeswe'retryingtocreateandamend andexpandthis district. We're
tryingtomake sure that theexpansiontothe south will createa welcoming livelyarea and encourage
greaterconnectivityto the waterfront for the community and the meansto create that iscreating flexible
buildingform, encourage the developmentofaffordable housing.to addresseasements and other
restrictions,tomeet flood resiliency needs, finally toaddress uniqueconditions to ensure we have
accessibleopen space tothe waterfront.

and other youth throughout the city. So April 121 h we've been engaging a bunch of non-profits and
agencies throughout the city to come support this initiative. We're actually doing work throughout four
developments St. Mary's, Betances, Patterson and Mott Haven. Our youth have also been engaging
NYPD Explorers and other youth organizations. Part of this event is actually intergenerational so we're
looking to engage seniors and adults so that way they come out an advocate for gardening, clean up,
cleanup beautification. We're doing a mural art project for everyone to be involved in. What we're doing
now is actively engaging adults and seniors to coµie out on April 12th to be a part of Green Day. You've
been given a handout hopefully you can consider coming yourself or try to get the word out so that we
can have folks come out to support our Youth Council. Jewels Marshall which I'm sure all of you know
is actually part of our Youth Council-we're happy to say that. Mr. Barber was kind enough to connect us
with her. So we're just having a great time since November we've done up to fifteen meetings
successfully and we're looking forward to having our final summit in June and every young person gets a
hundred hours of credits and will receive a certificate. We're doing a tree pit cleanup on Brook Avenue
so we're looking for another team to actively be involved in that as well.
BronxWorks
Mr. Glenn J. Bullock Community Engagement Coordinator said that a couple of years ago I had the
chance to address the Community Board on the Jobs-Plus Program which is an exclusive workforce
development program that focuses on certain housing developments. At the time when it came out two
years ago the three housing developments that we services were the Betances Houses. The Moore Houses
on 149th & Jackson and the Courtlandt buildings which are managed by Melrose but we did not provide
services at the time in Melrose. So I'm here today to say that we have won the new Jobs-Plus contract
administered by HRA and now not only can we continue Jobs-Plus services through the three
developments I just mentioned but they added the Melrose Houses. So beginning in April finally we start
providing employment services to folks who live in Melrose, one-on-one financial counseling, and also
building community supports, networks, sharing information and those sorts of things. So if there are
Melrose residents that you know they do not have to be on the lease they do have to live in the
developments then we can provide employment services and financial counseling to them. We do free
tax prep during the tax season. Coming through the Jobs-Plus Program people can actually get access to a
lot of BronxW orks Programs elsewhere for example we have a lot of seniors programs, a great HIV
prevention and support department. BronxWorks pretty much does everything for from toddlers to
seniors.
Questions and Comments
Councilmember Rafael Salamanca said good evening today was a nice day so was yesterday I think
that it's going to rain tomorrow. First I want to say how humbled I am to be here and just want to start off
with I am doing Participatory Budgeting. I'm sure you all know what that is I'm taking a million dollars
from my capital money that's allocated to me at City Hall and I'm allowing the community to tell me how
to spend that money. We went around to the communities throughout the last couple of months to get
ideas and we gave the ideas to City Hall. I mean to the Finance Committee in City Council and they
came out with ten projects that are acceptable for the Participatory Budgeting. So if you have not filled
out a ballot please do so. This is the only way that everyone is allowed to vote after that we're going to
submit this the ballots are going to get tallied and then we'll come back and make announcements as to
who are the winners for the Participatory Budgeting. I think one of the main ones in my Council District
is Alfred E. Smith High School lights for the football field which is one of my favorites because I went toPg.3
Alfred E. High School and we didn't have lights back then so it would be great as the Councilmember to
put lights.
This afternoon actually this morning I did a walk through down at the HUB you may see it in the news
with the Commissioner of Consumer Affairs. It's a new initiative that the Administration is doing and
basically we hit up 70 businesses on the HUB and it's just to educate the businesses to the do's and don'ts
so that you can avoid getting a violation. We ha<J an Inspector there with us they spoke to them and they
left information. If you need more information you can contact our office or you can contact the Third
A venue HUB Bid and they will provide you with any information or any business owners in the area that
did not get a visit from Consumer Affairs. On my way here to meet the Commissioner on 149th & Third
A venue I drove by Brook in front of the Horizon Detention Center and I saw what I always saw double
and triple parking and it really angered me. A year ago I did a walk-through of Horizon Detention Center
with the Commissioner Carrion at the time she's no longer there and I brought that to her attention I said
why is it that your employees are double and triple parking and parking on the sidewalk. You know no
one can walk through these sidewalks is unacceptable. I don't see anyone here from the 40 Precinct I'm
going to take it up with them as well. There's no enforcement from the 40 Precinct. This is something
that needs to be addressed. Ifl'm parked somewhere blocking a fi-re b,y..drant even with my permit from
the city I'll get a ticket and its $115 dollars. So why are they not enforcing number one and number two
why is the Department of Corrections allowing their employees to double and triple park. It's not about
double and triple parking its more that driving towards Westchester they have to drive over the yellow
line because cars are blocking. So rest assured that I'm on top of that and tomorrow morning at 11 AM
maybe you want to give you agency a heads up I'm going to call them out.
The other issue that I have is that I know last month you guys voted on the Phipps ULURP project on 156
maybe 2 months ago and now it's gotten to the stage that it's on my desk and I have issue with that
project ad I want to be very straight forward with the community. Mr. Weinstein who prides himself on
having employees that are part of labor the Teamsters when I went to Via Verde and saw them and said
wow they're doing a good job. I met with the Teamsters President. These guys are getting paid a little
less than $12 dollars an hour and they're not getting health insurance I have a problem with that. Now
they're offering them the Obama Care Insurance. But now these employees are having an option to
choose whether they get the insurance of Obama Care I know there's another name for it Affordable Care.
It's either that or bring food to the table and what are they choosing they're choosing to bring food to the
table. Here you have a CEO that's being compensated over $7 hundred thousand dolla5rs a year but yet
he is sub-contracting with sub-contractors with the Teamsters and they're paying their employees less
than $12 dollars an hour ad they're not providing them with health insurance. So until Mr. Weinstein
fixes that problem I'm going to have a problem with his ULURP and it may get denied from my office.
With that my office is on Southern Boulevard & Westchester and I'm here to serve you. I take seriously
the work that I do and very seriously protecting workers rights. I'm very passionate about my work. God
Bless you all.

Chairman and District Manager's Report
The District Manager Cedric L. Loftin introduced the honorable Public Advocate Ms. Letitia James.
Honorable Letitia James New York City Public Advocate aid hello everybody and it's an honor and a
privilege to be here at Community Board 1. For those who do not.know me I am your Public Advocate
and I'm here obviously to talk to you a little bit about what the Office of Public Advocate does. The
Office of Public Advocate is second in line to the Mayor of the City of New York. The Public Advocate
presides over the City Council. If you can't sleep at night you can always watch the cable channel where
I preside over the City Council I guarantee you that will put you to sleep. In addition to that the Public
Advocate introduces legislation. I have introduced more legislation than any other Public Advocate in
history. We also sit and I am a trustee on the NYCER's Board which is the Pension Board for the City of
New York where we invest retiree's monies in investments seeking a high yield for their retirement. In
addition to that the Office of Public Advocate I've sort of transformed somewhat we have Case Workers,
Social Workers you can walk in we can resolve your issue you don't need a fancy Lawyer you don't need
a high paid Lobbyist all you need is a cause. We also have an Investigative Unit and last but not least we
have a legal department because I am a Lawyer where we are basically engaging in litigation based on
pattern and practice and based on when agencies fail to do their job. So although the Mayor and I are
close allies we worked in the City Council previously I represented downtown Brooklyn we're in
different roles and now I have to sue him and so I've sued the Mayor from time to time I've also sued the
Governor from time to time particularly when we feel that individuals are not being heard and they have
grievances that have not been addressed by the City and/or State agencies such as children in Foster Care.
Children who I argued were not being cared for but psychologically and sexually abused and we brought
the attention to the Mayor's Office. In addition to disabled children that were riding on hot buses. The
law requires that you have air conditioned buses and the buses last summer were not working and the
children who unfortunately were not verbal were being transported to schools in buses seated in over 100
degrees. Unfortunately we could not get that corrected so that's why we took it into litigation. So that's
some of the cases that we have initiated.
Just today I had a forum because this is Women's History Month. So today we had a forum with Chelsea
Clinton and we announced that we have legislation that will be passed on April 5th and the legislation
goes something like this perspective employers cannot ask perspective employees about their salary
history. Why, because women often times leave the workforce and are disadvantaged when they come
back into the workforce after raising children or caring for a sick parent or grandparent. They often time
argue against themselves and they're put at a disadvantage. So now certain employees not all but certain
employees will not have to post salaries so that individuals and particularly and this effects all employees
both men and women again not be in a position where they're arguing against themselves. It goes to the
issue of pay equity women not being paid less than men for basically doing the same job and if you thinkPg.5
that this is a women's issue it is not because it's an issue that effects all of us it effects our families, it
effects our economy. We want to again provide more resources to women so that we can raise the stake
for women so that we can address the issue of feminization of poverty in this State. That bill will be
passed in the City Council on April 5th and I want to thank the Mayor for that. We passed a bill several
weeks ago where we're going to do a pilot program where we're going to promote recycling. So
individuals that live in Public Housing will receive cards where you can redeem those cards and you will
get discounts as long as you recycle. What we'r~ trying to do is promote recycling, why is that because
we New York City taxpayers spend billions with regards to trash garbage is a business and individuals are
making billions of dollars off trash. In order to reduce those costs we need to reduce the amount of
garbage that we send to other States to deal with our garbage because we're running out of space here in
New York.
I know here in this district as I walked in you were talking about opioids again I want to applaud the
efforts of Councilman Salamanca and the First Lady of the City of New York for all that we're doing
about the drug crisis that we're seeing and I know that I attended a forum here in this district with respect
to the problems and I know that the Council Member is workiQg on it along with the Mayor of the City of
New York. My office too is seeking to address those conditions that c rrently exist and provide help to
individuals including those individuals that might be in the midst of drug addiction and including those
individuals who might be losing their life. It's really important that we train individuals on how to help
so that we can reverse the trend of those people that are dying from drug overdosing in the City of New
York.
Last again promoting green economy it will increase opportunities for individuals that are unemployed.
Also when I was a member of the City Council we were working with the Administration to get jobs in
the Film Industry particularly Production Assistants because they pay good salaries. It's critically
important that after we give tax dollars to production crews all throughout the City of New York that they
have to train New York City residents in these good jobs which can lead to the middle class. But not the
least we all need to focus on small businesses supermarkets are closing gas stations are closing and before
you close your eyes up pops a luxury condo. So what we really need to do is address those public assets
that are in the City and of course rent is too high. We need to make sure that we build housing for
moderate working families. The scoured of homelessness is a sin thousands of New Yorkers including
children are homeless. We need to build affordable housing for people who live here and we need to
make sure that we build housing for families, seniors and supportive housing. We need to again
recognized that a lot of these individuals have lost work and we have to confront the stereotype their not
drug addicts or lazy it's just that their wages are too low and they cannot pay these rents which are
unfortunately escalating. So all of us need to talk about the homeless and the homeless is us it's our
friends our family. A lot of individuals in these shelters they work and the issue of domestic violence.
We need to talk about these issues as the Mayor of the City of New York seeks to address this growing
crisis. So those are the issues and I will open it up for questions.
Questions and Comments
Detective Claudia Mera 40th Police Precinct said good evening everyone the CO excuses himself he's
at a meeting with Father Skelly. Some of you know if you follow us Twitter and now we're on Facebook
we have a'Safe Streets event that's every Thursday everybody seems to be very receptive to it the streets
are full of kids they're playingjump rope, basketball. We have light food and refreshments for them. I
understand some parking issues came up and the 40th Precinct is dealing with the best they can. We have
construction that takes about 500 feet from Third Avenue onto 13gth Street that's about a good fifteenPg.6
spots. Police Officers although we have a Parking Lot is a very tiny Parking Lot and we don't all fit at
any given time there's about 300 people in that building we have to come to work. The Supervisors are
doing their best to get us out of the crosswalks. We ask to please bear with us and we do know that it's an
issue and we try to make it as safe and comfortable for everybody. April 5th is our next Annual Safety
Forum and I confirm from every department within the NYPD you'll have Vice, you'll have narcotics
you have school safety you have sanitation and traffic there will be a rep from each of these to speak to
you with Q and A for an hour. This is on the 5th ~t 6:30 in the Lincoln Hospital Auditorium. We do this
every year and it's hard to get them there and the seats are empty ifl could have all of you get there its
great information.
Officer Hector Espada said that I don't know if anyone has noticed but 149 and Melrose is getting a
little better day by day. We have assigned a couple of Officers at that comer during the day to make sure
that the citizens that like to hang there are moving along.
Questions and Comments
Mr. Saul Rivera Community Coordinator New York City Department of Health & Mental Hygiene
said that I've been attending Bronx Community Board 1 meetings for the past couple of months. It's
amazing to see everybody coming together and talking about these issues and if you look around we have
a lot of people in here but did you know that one out of five people is suffering from a mental illness in
any given year. So those are the statistics from Thrive NYC. Thrive NYC is the First Lady of the City
Chirlane McCray's initiative to address mental health issues in the City of New York. So as part of that
there has been an adaptation of a Mental Health First Aid Course. So similar to First Aid and CPR we
have prepared this course that will prepare you in the case of an emergency or if someone is having a
mental health crisis, mental health illness or the early stages of a mental health disease, Alzheimer's or
anything else connected with a psychosis. As a matter of fact I just came from giving instruction on the
course. It's an 8-hour course from 8:30 AM to 5:00 PM. We cover so many things in this course we give
so much information that people even wouldn't realize how much of this is common in our city around
the area. In this course you will receive a manual and the course is administered in many different
languages we have English, Spanish, Mandarin also Bengali. We have a course in Spanish that 'coming
up on April 6th it is at the Segunda Ruiz Belvis Clinic on 142°d and St. Ann's. It is an all-Spanish
language course and we do have an English course coming up on April 11th as well. It is free for
everybody and at the end of the course you receive a certificate that's good for three years from the
National Health Behavioral Council and for that it will open up pathways if interested looking into health
fields. If anyone is interested you can have my name and number and then from there we can work on
how we can bring this training to you and my primary audience is the faith community but none the less
we do have this training at the Department of Health on 175th and Arthur Avenue my number is 646-265-
4363.

Elected Officials Reports
The representative from the Mayor's Office said that I've been here before but I wanted to come back
tonight I have a few announcements coming from the Mayor himself. So Saul who just left spoke about
Thrive NYC and the things we're doing for mental health issues. Part of Thrive NYC is an initiative that
we have called Healing NYC. How many people know about the opioid crisis in the South Bronx. There
is an opioid crisis happening in the South Bronx yve in response to that launched Healing NYC and that
basically says it's a few parts to it one of the parts is that by 2020 all NYPD Officers will hold Naloxone
kits on them. The Naloxone kits save people that are overdosed on heroin or opioids. So say someone is
suffering from an opioid overdose an NYPD Officer can heal them or treat them with the Naloxone kit
that they will be required to carry. That's something that will be established with every NYPD Officer
down to the Captain will have one of these. In addition to that there are a series of other events and
initiatives to create awareness of opioids and anti-opioids. So if you have any questions about that I'm
happy to answer them. So the training will happen there was a scheduling conflict and they canceled it.
It's going to happen for the South Bronx and the First Lady herself will be there we've committed to that.
There's already been one in Brooklyn so we want to replicate it in all five boroughs.
Questions and Comments
The representative for the Bronx Borough President said that for those Board Members that did not
reapply today is the last day as official Board Members. So we'll send you the list of those Board
Members that did not reapply. Yesterday we released our Annual Development Report again the Bronx
had a record number of investment 3 .3 billion dollars-worth of investment Community Board 7 led the
way this year and Community Board 1 was in second place. Since 2009 Community Board 1 has led all
the twelve Community Boards in investment dollars. So just to give you a quick snapshot of what we're
talking about 3 .3 bilJion dollars of investments residential investment 1. 7 billion, commercial investment
1.3 other investments 2.28 million dollars encompasses parks, infrastructure projects for organizations
and so on. A number of new buildings, 365 new buildings in the Bronx, new residential addresses 239,
schools and other properties hospitals as well 2.34 million dollars investment in the Bronx. So please I
encourage everybody to go to the Borough President's website where you will get the full Report there.
Lastly mark this down May 11th that's Bronx Week we are having a Community Board Appreciation
night it's going to be over at the Bronx Supreme Court building in the rotunda from 6-8 PM. Once we
have all the details we will email all the Board Members the information.
The representative for Congressman Jose E. Serrano said that this is my first time here and I am the
Community Liaison for Jose Serrano the Congressman and I'm here to announce an event that we will be
having tomorrow to celebrate Women's History Month. It will take place in the Bronx Museum 165th and
Grand Concourse from 6-8 PM. Feel free to invite anyone you want we will have performances and we
would love to see new faces there. Like I said I'm the new representative if you have any questions feel
free to ask but I will have more for future Board Meetings I will be here every month.
The representative from Senator Jose M. Serrano's Office said that he recently introduced the Liberty
Act (S. 4075A) which would protect immigrants from unjust deportations and racial profiling. The
Liberty Act will also prohibit local authorities from stopping or arresting a person based on their
perceived immigration status.Pg.8
This month during our Constituent Hours we will be bringing in legal services for our immigration
community throughout the 29th Senate District. The Mayor's Office of Immigrant Affairs and Legal
Services NYC have been tabling with us in the Bronx, East Harlem and the Upper West Side. For the
month of May our Constituent Hours will be focused on creating awareness about the small and large
ways in which our communities can contribute to a more sustainable city and planet. We will be joined
by GrowN YC and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation who will be sharing
information about various services and prograrp.s available to anyone who is willing to become a better
steward of the environment.
The representative for Assemblywoman Carmen E. Arroyo said that what we've been working with if
you know that Junior High School IS162 is closing and we're opening another school in its place which is
a STEM and Dual Language school. So there is a Committee from the Chancellor's Office and I'm part
of that to get the school setup. We've had meetings with the community and parents and they're excited
about it we have a lot of money that's coming in for the school and to keep the children in the school if
they want to stay or they could apply to the other five Middle Schools. So it's a new school it's STEM
and Dual Language and it's opening in September. The 162 clcses in June 30th and during the summer
we will be doing the setups for that school. All the Assembly people are up in State with the Governor
working budgets.
The representative for the New York City Comptroller's Office said that it's been quite some time
and I apologize and I mentioned to a few of your that there are some transitions in our office why I can't
be some places even though I would like to be here more often, I will try.
So I brought a few reports over but I'm just go over two very briefly. The first is an Aging Report so
from 2005 to 2015 about 1.1 million adults over 65 live in New York City and the city has not done much
to make accommodations for the seniors. So more than 40 percent of households are senior headed
households dependent on government programs. The Comptroller is proposing that eligible seniors be
enrolled into SCRIE. Seniors don't have SCRIE because they don't know what it is or how to attain it so
they want automatic enrollment. So he raised threshold for SCRIE to $50, 000 dollars a year. Also he's
proposing the expansion of the Senior Citizens Homeowners Exemption so if you're a senior over 65
making $37,000 or below you are eligible for this program. Also there should be money for seniors who
want to upgrade their homes who can't pay for the upgrades or their landlord won't do the upgrades
because it's so much money there should be more opportunity to do so.
The other report is on the National Endowment for the Arts there is a lot of money around the country for
art. So between 2000 to 2016 the NEA gave $233 million to New York City. So Trump wants to cut the
program. So just keep in mind that the National Endowment is one third of one hundred and one percent
of the Federal Budget. I guess he's cutting it because it's too much. We all think that it's critical not only
does the Comptroller think that. So we're going to be doing things in the future regarding this program.
The representative from the Public Advocates Office said that on April 191 h she's having a South
Bronx Town Hall at Casita Maria on Simpson Street from 6 to 8 PM. It's very essential that people
RSVP b:::cause we did have one scheduled for March but the snowstorm. Please spread the word.Pg. 9
The representative from the Council Speakers Office said that there is a lot of information in my
newsletter but the most important thing that I want to say that if I don't know what's going on in the
community you are our eyes and ears so my contact information is on here you can email or call you
don't have to come to the office and tell me what the issue is and I'll try to address it. There's a lot of
things going on the overdoses with the cars with the lighting so if there's anything that the Speaker can do
to make it better I would know if you guys would call or email me and we will try to fix it. We have a
Housing Clinic and last month we had the lawye~s not to come because not one person registered for a
free lawyer advice Housing Clinic. The community is not taking advantage of and utilizing the things
that we give out. So we have a free Immigration Clinic, Housing Clinic and a CCRB Clinic. We have a
lot of clinics that we have going on but some people don't even bother coming to them so it's very
important that you utilize the newsletter and things that are there and you can always call me and ask me
what we can do to make it better.
Assemblyman Michael Blake said hello everybody and hopes that everyone is doing well in the room.
We are in Albany and this is the critical week of us working on the budgets if we are to be on time of
getting the budget done its due by midnight tomorrow night. But we don't know if that's going to happen
to be very honest with everyone. We are aggressively pushing forward on priorities on education for an
increase in foundation aid so we can get more monies to our schools. Again making sure that there's an
increase in foundation aid. We are not where we need to be as of yet right now we're pushing the Senate
Republicans and the IDC to increase the numbers and the Governor quite frankly to increase the money
that needs to be there. The overall budget 63 billion dollars for all expenses but recognize that about 70
percent of that goes to Medicaid and Education as a whole. But then there's breakdowns on how the
education may dole out. So that's one. Number two our Criminal Justice System we are aggressively
pushing to raise the age as you know New York and North Carolina are only two states in the country
with sixteen and seventeen year olds are tried as adults. So we are aggressively pushing for several items
including the sealing of records for sixteen and seventeen year olds. So they don't have to wait ten years
for their record to be sealed. Pushing forward to have young people tried in Family Court and also to
provide them with the services they need in the first place. That we make sure to find ways that ifthe DA
is trying to file any motions for Criminal Court that there is a high burden of circumstances that they
would have to meet in order for that to be the case. We want to help these kids. We're also pushing to
get more funding as relates to housing there's a current proposal $500 million dollars for NYCHA
Specifically $100 million dollars over a five-year span. On top of that we're pushing for an increase of
$400 million dollars for Mitchell Lama funding which relates to affordable and supportive housing as
well. So that we can have affordable housing in the district, community and throughout. Also the
Republicans have moved forward on rent regulations as well when we think of overall in terms of job
creation the Governor put forth a proposal of $1.2 billion. So where we're at right now we're in Albany
we will be here again tomorrow we don't know if we will be here during the weekend and what that looks
like. The prior week and this week are critical week when we're trying to get the budget done. But our
priorities are to you. Deon, John and Tina are doing a yeoman's work. If you have any questions on the
budget I'm going to give you our Assembly phone number 518-455-5272 and ask for Joelle Cullo she is
my Legislative Director.

Chairman and District Manager’s Report

Mr. Cedric L. Loftin District Manager said as everyone knows since January 2017 we have a new
President a new election and the President has come up with various policies and one of the ideas and
polices he has is trying to create some type of new environment related to people being able to come into
the country achieve employment be able to stay here and some families that were here got separated and
it’s really gotten to the point of an enforcement issue. Where certain parts of the government have
actively gone out in different parts of the country for to get people on certain types of violations and that
have a record and then take those people out of the environment that they presently reside in. The issue
was how does the impact of what ICE is doing Immigration Customs Enforcement have on our city and
on people coming from other parts of the country that are here». So I sent correspondence to two people
first to the American Civil Liberties Union when this first broke out that-was three weeks ago no one ever
responded to me. I called them up again no one ever responded to my calls. So I assume that they were
not interested in what was happening in the Bronx they never responded to my query. However, I then
reached out to my Commanding Officer to come and speak about the issue related to ICE and he’s here
tonight to talk to us about what the Police policy is and what it’s related to what ICE is doing. I’m going
to ask our Deputy Inspector Brian C. Hennessy to come up and he has the floor. He’s been our
Commander for eight months and he’s done a yeoman’s job in that time.

Deputy Inspector Brian C. Hennessy Commanding Officer of the 40"" Police Precinct said thank you
Mr. Loftin for inviting me tonight regarding some of the issues of the residents in the community on their
immigration status. The New York City Police Department doesn’t require immigration status. When it
comes to someone being stopped in the street a victim of a crime or a witness we will never ask their
immigration status whether it be for a summons or an arrest we don’t ask that at all in any scenario what-
so-ever. The New York City ID we consider it a valid form of government ID what don’t ask
immigration status we don’t force civil immigration warrants whether it be from an ICE Agent or
Administrative Judge. The only thing we do however we will honor a Federal Detainer. If someone in
custody is arrested for a violent crime or is suspected of terrorism and he gets fingerprinted and those rap
sheets come back our Criminal Justice Bureau will get the Detainer from ICE and will hold him for ICE
on that violent felony or terrorist act. But other than those actions we don’t take any action. We don’t
inquire about immigration status we don’t detain arrest or anything other than that status just mentioned.
As far as ICE action in the Precinct in my prior precinct sporadically from time to time you would have a
notification that enforcement was being done but since I’ve been here I’ve not had any notification that
enforcement was being done in this Precinct when we are aware of it we will let the Board know and keep
you informed. But that is the department policy regarding immigration status.

Elected Officials Reports

The representative from State Senator Serrano’s office said that Senator’s Serrano and Hoylman
introduced bills to make New York a safe place for immigrants The New York State Liberty Act Bill
(S4075A) would protect immigrants from being victimized by unjust deportation procedures and racial
profiling. The legislation would ensure that that anyone in need of vital government services would not
be unnecessarily questions about their immigration status. The Liberty Act also prohibits local law
enforcement agencies from stopping or arresting a person based on perceived immigration status or a
suspected violation of federal immigration law, prevents them from inquiring about the immigration
status of persons contacting such agencies including victims and witnesses and provides the right to legal
representation for all people facing deportation proceedings. In addition, Senator Bill 4234 would prevent
the State local governments from participating in any federal registry or database based upon race, color,
creed, gender, sexual orientation, religion or national or ethnic origin.

Senator Serrano is a co-sponsor of the Raise the Age Legislation (Bill $5642A of 2015) and will continue
to fight for the passage of this important legislation. Every year as you know nearly 28,000 sixteen and
seventeen year-olds face the possibility of prosecution as adults in criminal court. So in order to prevent
that there is that bill. As research has shown, placing adolescents in an adult criminal justice system is
counterproductive for both the defendant ad for public safety.

Finally I would like to remind you that every Tuesday we hold Constituent Hours either in a public
library or in a senior center. The next Constituent Hours will be on Tuesday in the Bronx on February
28"" at the Mitchel Houses Senior Center from 11 AM to 2 PM.

The representative from Councilmember Salamanca’s office said that just want to mention a couple of
things one on Monday we will be having a Black History celebration co-sponsoring with Senator
Serrano’s office it will be happening at HOSTOS Community College it will be from 10-1 and we’re
encouraging everyone to come out. We will be honoring a lot or our local officials and dignitaries for the
work they do in the community. Secondly we’re working on a Know Your Rights Town Hall and hoping
to have it within the next couple of weeks maybe the second week in Marsh. What we’re trying to do is
educate our documented and undocumented constituents letting them know what their rights are. We
want to educate people and let them know as much as they can and also to let them know documented or
undocumented you’re still our constituents and we’re here to serve you no matter what. Additionally
we’re also going to be having legal services from New York Legal Services the Bronx chapter working
here in our office on March 9"". So their doing it scheduled through appointments so you can call our

Pg. 5

Public Session

Women In Need (WIN)

Ms. Robin Fernandez, Housing Coordinator Powers Avenue Residence said that DHS owns the
building where Woman In Need operate a shelter. The building took in residents after hurricane Sandy.
Currently we have 75 units. Our staff we have three Case Managers, myself as the Housing Specialist, a
Case Manager Supervisor and a Director. Basically our goal is to help the homeless population by
finding permanent housing.

My job is basically to build relationships with small business owners who may have residences that
they’re interested in renting out to voucher holders. I work with DHS to match residents to open
apartments that are available. Basically we are in the third quarter and we’re all working very hard to get
some families placed. So if you do have any questions feel free to reach out to me and if you’re interested
in renting your units please our families need these apartments. Unfortunately a lot of landlords have a
stereotype against a lot of voucher holders. Not everyone is the same so if you do have an apartment that
you’re willing to rent let me know.

End of Public Session

Chairman and District Manager’s Report

The District Manager said that tonight we have a Public Hearing before us coming to us through the
ULURP process from the City of New York. The Board members have the item on the Agenda sheet and
I will read it out for the record. The time now is 6:07 PM and this will be a Public Hearing with the
results sent down to the City of New York and the Borough President’s Office. There is a presentation
that is part of this process that will be made by the applicant. After I finish with is portion of the Public
Hearing then the applicant will come forth and give their presentation. The Board members will have the
right to ask questions and then into the persons that have requested to speak related to the item on the
agenda.

The item is related to application # C 170140 ZMX, CEQR Number 17DCP025X, Project 600 East 156""
Street. An application submitted by 600 Associates, LLC pursuant to Section 197-c and 201 of the New
York City Charter for the amendment of the Zoning Map Section No. 6c by changing from an M1-1 to an
R8A District property bounded by Eagle Avenue, 156"" Street Cauldwell Avenue, and a line 100 feet
southwesterly of 156th Street, Borough of the Bronx, Community District 1. This is a voting item by the
Community Board.

The reason we’re having this meeting today is because the Board has to vote on this action before the
23"" of January. That’s why we’re having the meeting on the 19"". We’re going to move on and I’m
asking the firms representatives to come forward and give their presentation on this item.

Pg.3

The District Manager said that we’re going to hold the Public Hearing at this time 6:11 PM and go into
another item which is Elected Officials Reports.

Elected Officials Reports

The representative from the Bronx Borough President’s Office Ruben Diaz, Jr. said good evening
folks for the Board members we have the Parliamentary Workshop. Tom has been emailing folks on the
Board if you’re able to attend and you have not confirmed yet please call me or email me with your
confirmation. If you’re not able to attend on Monday we’ re having another workshop early spring so in
March or early April will have a second workshop. We’re also working with City Planning to have
workshops on the ULURP process being that the Bronx is having a number of ULURP items coming up
in the Community Boards. So we want to give a refresher on the ULURP process for the Board Members
so once we have a date set for that we will notify you guys. For those Board Members that are up for
reappointment if you have not submitted your reappointment application please do so, so that we can start
the process. If anyone here is interested in applying for the Community Board I have some applications
that are out in the front so please take one and fill it out you can aiso log on to the Borough President’s
website and you can download the application there and submit it to our office as well. Lastly just to sort
of report to you guys the Governor had his State of the State address last week and he’s stepped forward
and provided the $108 million dollars for the Kingsbridge Armory. Its exciting news that place has been
vacant for 25 years now it’s going to be developed into the Kingsbridge International Ice Center Project.
So that’s significant for our borough and also he’s provided funding for a major rehab project over at
Orchard Beach. So the historical pavilion over at Orchard Beach will finally get a major facelift in the
next coming years. So you guys have my card any questions or concerns feel free to give me a call. I
also brought some flyers for the Parliamentary Training.

The representative from the Office of the Mayor Bill DeBlasio said that I’m happy to be here today
and wanted to make sure that I was here because I wanted to introduce myself to introduce myself to
some of you and reintroduce myself to some of you. I’m the new Bronx Director for the Mayor DeBlasio
and I’m excited to get work in this area and to continue to develop on what we’ve already started at the
beginning of his office. A little bit about myself I worked at the City Council for 4 years as an intern and
now I’m at the Mayor’s office. If you have any questions I have my business cards on me and can hand
them out to you if you need. I also want to say that the Mayor is having the State of the City address
coming up soon and if you’re interested in attending please reach out to me via text, email or however
you need to. My email is JCortes@cityhall.nyc.gov.

The representative from Assemblyman Michael Blake’s Office said that I just have three quick
announcements for today the first one is we are continuing our tenants program so if you know of anyone
having issues with housing from 11 Am to 3 PM every Tuesday you can call make an appointment or
walk in and an individual from HRA is at the office to kind of help you or directly try to address that
housing issue. The second thing is that we’re starting a partnership with Get Enrolled an organization
from the Mayor’s Office which helps people enroll in healthcare and there’s open enrollment for Obama
care until the 31 and next Wednesday will be the last day because then enrollment runs out. On
Wednesday between 11 AM and 5 PM you walk in and if you or someone you know needs health
insurance they will help you and go through the whole process just make sure that you have your income
statement and anything else you think you need to enroll in health care. So that’s the second thing and
our third and final item is we’re having our State of the District this Sunday which is the 22""! at 2 PM and
the doors open at 1:30 and it’s at 1870 Crotona Avenue on 176"" Street and will be held at VIP

Pg. 4

Community Services so if you want information on that or to RSVP I will leave flyers so you guys can
pick one up and give us a call.

The Chairman called for a motion on the Elected Officials Reports.
Motion made to approve the Elected Officials Reports as presented. Motion duly seconded. Motion
called and passed unanimously.

Police Officer Hector Espada said that hopefully everybody had a good 2016. Sorry I was late we’re
doing a Safe Street up on Courtlandt Avenue and 152* Street we’re closing down the streets and basically
letting the community know that we’re here to support them. We’re here to make sure that the streets are
safe so we’re trying to work even if it takes us one street at a time we’re going to do it. I know it’s a long
process but have patience with us and we’ll try to get the job done. We’re having more presence in the
Bid area especially 149 and 3"" which has been a major concern for the community we’re going to try to
clean it up. Like I said it doesn’t happen overnight ladies and gentlemen please be patient with us we’re
trying to work as much as we can with the manpower that we have. Please I have an open door policy
and if you guys want to see me and talk to me the majority of this community knows where to see me and
talk to me. So like I said hopefully 2017 will be even a better year. Anyone with any issues or concerns
please feel free to express that right now if you want to.

Committee Reports

The District Manager said that we only have one Committee Report of the Municipal Services
Committee which is a follow up on an item that we dealt with four times last year which is traffic safety
and improvements to the area. DOT came back and gave a brief update of some of the changes that will
happen to try and increase some of the flow of traffic to the Randall’s Island Connector and also to make
sure that safety enhancements happen with cyclists and pedestrians you have the information in your
folders. As everyone knows last year we had an unfortunate accident around 138"" Street a woman god
bless her soul lost her life to the Coca Cola truck that ran off the road. So one of the aspects of our trying
to improve areas in that way was to come up with traffic safety plans. We just need your approval so that
they can move forward and start implementing some of these changes. Some of the changes I will tell
you will reduce some of the parking in the area around 133"" Street but they have to do that if they don’t
there’s not going to be enough width for cyclists, pedestrians and cars and if that happens we’ll have more
accidents because we’re getting a lot more traffic and truck traffic. So I need your support on this and I
need a vote from the Board that you want the city to move forward. Without the vote I will tell you that
the city will probably cut back and I will say that a lot of this DOT funding came from the Fed’s and we
have a new President and I don’t know if the funding will be there next time around in the budget so it’s
very dicey related to what’s going to happen so let’s make sure that we secure these funds while we have
them.

The Chairman called for a motion on the New York City Department of Transportation (DOT)
Safety Improvement Project at Bruckner Boulevard and East 138 Street and Randall Island
Connector.

Motion made to approve support for the New York City Department of Transportation (DOT) Safety
Improvement Project at Bruckner Boulevard and East 138"" Street and Randall Island Connector. Motion

Pg.5

Motion made to approve the Committee Report as presented. Motion duly seconded. Motion called and
passed unanimously.

The District Manager said we’re now going back to the Public Hearing item the firm is ready to move
forward with their presentation.

Public Hearing reopened at 6:23 PM
Power point presentation provided.

Mr. Mark Koskovitz said that this is a two-part project of a Charter School on the first two floors and
above that housing. Phipps is the oldest non-for-profit developer in the city and they have an extensive
track record with a significant number of units here and Phipps will own the project once it’s complete.
So I’m from Curtis & Ginsberg the Architect and we’ve done extensive affordable housing and planning
and Phipps is in the process of selecting a Contractor at this point and Phipps will be the Property
Manager they manage over 76 hundred units. Next slide is talking about the building itself it?s 175 units
and 12-stories. We will have information later on the exact income levels but it’s for low, moderate and
extremely low under the HPD and HDC mix and match. There’s a 30 square foot Charter School serving
K-4 students. Now I’m going to introduce Eric Felzac who is from Civic Builders who will tell you more
about the school.

Mr. Eric Falzac said that Civic Builders is a real estate development organization with a focus on
Charter School development and we started in 2002 and developed over 21 Charter Schools serving over
11 thousand students putting out over $500 million dollars in the communities we serve. We also have
completed a number of schools in the South Bronx area Bronx Charter School for the Arts, Icahn Charter
School 2, Brilla College Prep and Heketi Community Charter School. So the school we’re looking to
occupy the space is Brilla College Prep a K-4 school and nearly 90 percent of Brilla’s students live at or
beneath the poverty level 22 percent that have a special education designation, 23 percent are English
Language Lerners and generally has 10-20 students that flout in and out of homelessness or insecure
housing situations. So Brilla is a high performing school they out-perform the districts standards by 46
percent in math and 120 percent in language arts. There academic program is supplemented by a robust
character education program that focuses on four core virtues: courage, justice, wisdom and self-control.
This school will be about 450 students K-4 elementary school and they will have a lottery preference in
district 7 which is the South Bronx.

Mr. Mark Koskovitz said that the next slide is a bird’s eye view of the site it’s what’s in red this is
where you could see where we started to look at the scale of the different buildings and it’s a mixed
neighborhood you’ve got low rise and then you’ve got some very high rise and a number of things in
between. With that in mind how did we develop the massing and design of the building so based on
zoning and a building base height we were then required to have setbacks using something called the
Dormer Rule to modulate those setbacks. The site has a 15 foot slope on it and we tried to use this to our
advantage. The first two floors are the school but a lot of the school is in what is technically the cellar.

Pg. 6

So by using the slope of the site we were able to have classrooms with windows on the street on both
levels and we then have the school entrance on 156"" Street and a residential entrance on the side of the
building. We then started looking at the neighborhood and this is how we started thinking about the
design and how we developed ideas. So then here is a view on 156"" Street there’s the school entrance
that you can see the windows of the school are red with a red band around them. The school will operate
during the day and then they will do programs in the evening and you’ll be able to walk down the street
and see people and they will be able to see out. Tied into that we will be putting lighting all around the
building to increase security and also with night to make it a well-lit place for people walking down the
street. This is then the entrance to the school as you can see here the red windows in more detail.

These are some examples of other schools Civic Builders has developed and we plan to do something
similar. So here on the lower level as you can see at this end on Eagle we can exit directly out. We have
a gymnasium multi-purpose room and a cafeteria with a warming kitchen, an assembly room and then we
have a number of classrooms. Then this is the utility space, the electrical and water room for both parts of
it and the trash room. So on the main floor this is the school entrance we’ll have the main stair here to get
to the lower level you’ll be able to go up here and we’ll have an outdoor classroom and then all of the
classrooms on this level will have windows. Then this is the residential lobby I’Il show you where we
have a ramp going down and stairs going in fully handicapped accessible with elevators. So here is the
residential entrance again we’re having to deal with the extensive slope of the neighborhood. The
building will be three colors of brick. These are examples of two different lobbies we’ve done and expect
to have a lobby of similar quality and finish. This is a typical residential floor I will be showing you
plans of the apartments in more detail where we have the elevators and one stair and the elevators will
have a window overlooking the play area. Up on the ninth floor we have an outdoor recreation space,
community room a fitness room and a laundry room. So we have these activity spaces for people in the
building to go to exercise to have events together and to sit outside we will be having some green space.

This is an example of what the apartments will look like just to give an idea we’re going to go through
each of the studio, one, two and three bedrooms. This is a drawing giving you an idea of the apartment.
This is where the window would be we just dotted it in so this would be a studio apartment with a
kitchen, bathroom here and a living space here one bedroom living area, kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, the
two bedroom we just add a bedroom and the bathroom is over here the kitchen is a bit larger the three
bedroom we then have two bathrooms, and the living space gets a little larger. All the units are designed
to meet or exceed the HPD guidelines. I will now let Phipps give more specific information.

Mr. Michael Wadman Vice President of Real Estate Phipps Houses said that we wanted to provide a
pretty full design overview for you. One of the comments from the Committee meeting last month was
that we really didn’t give a feel of what it would be like to live here and the kind of amenities. I hope this
provides that kind of feel for the type of high quality housing this is going to be. Wanted to talk a little
bit more about the housing program and the way it’s distributed. So as you can see from the slide we
actually changed the affordability since we were at the Committee meeting in December. Based on
comments received at that meeting and subsequent conversations with your Councilman and others we’ve
changed the orient from serving the lowest income range 30 percent of median and a higher range 80
percent of median that has been typical in past affordable projects. So about half of the project will be at
80 percent of median so that’s a family of four earning about $72 thousand dollars a year, 20 percent of
the units will be at the extremely low 30 percent of the median so that’s a family of four earning about
$27 thousand dollars a year this is also part of HPD which they call their “Our Space” initiative some of
those 30 percent median units are for shelter homeless referrals I should say that no one has to leave
because they go over in income which is pretty much all the projects so you’re not penalized for earning

Pg. 7

more over time you simply stay in your unit. As Mark pointed out we kind of put amenities all in one
place on the ninth floor so you can do laundry and run down the hall to the fitness room or the community
room those kinds of activities we been doing more increasingly in our buildings to make them more
pleasant for the residents. Over 60 percent of the units at two and three bedrooms so we’re really serving
a family population here. I should say that the family type unit is for all income levels described, all
affordability is mixed throughout the building so regardless if you’re shelter referral or any percent of
median family you have the same opportunity in getting into a two or three bedroom depending on family
size. This is just more detail so the units of the different sizes the affordability bands are laid out here 10
percent of 30 AMI “Our Space”, 10 percent units of the 30 AMI, 30 percent units of the 50 AMI, and 50
percent units of the 80 AMI. The 50 percent AMI is also to serve a group that has not been served very
much in the past. As you probably know most projects have a lot of 60 percent median so if you’re at 50
or a little less you probably can’t afford that unit so this gets rid of the 60 percent band and is 50 instead
so I think all three of these are underserved traditionally. In this band is families earning between $15 and
$28 grand, in this category is $25 through $47 and in the 80 AMI it’s families between $40 and about $96
thousand. In the 80 percent band you’re allowed to lease all the way up to 100 percent median the idea is
to catch a wide swap of families earning a little too much for the traditional programs and not enough to
find good housing in the neighborhood. At this very top range you’re talking about families that really
don’t have income at the moment and their rents are set at shelter rent so we’re not expecting any income
to pay for rent.

A little bit more about the general information about numbers it’s about an $86 million dollar project
about $60 of that it construction related hard costs the rest is soft costs and other kinds of expenses. It’s
going to have a high level sustainable design with solar power panels on the roof to help provide
electricity, very high efficiency boilers and Green Communities Certification. Then of course we will be
working in two areas construction employment where the General Contractor will be accepting
applications and then for permanent jobs there are two categories here one is the Phipps side of the
equation which is Property Management and Maintenance and the second side which is actually a much
bigger employer is the school on those ground floors. There will be about 45 permanent jobs and that’s
the employment side. This is just a little breakdown on how the money works you’ve got city agencies
up at the top providing the bulk of the money you’ve got HDC and HPD, sponsor loans through Phipps
got some money that Civic will bring to the table for the Charter School so there will be a fair amount of
money that’s not just the city’s. So this is just regarding timing and as you know we’re in ULURP and
this is the Community Board Hearing we were certified in mid-November so that timeline is seven
months but in any case we would hope with everybody’s support to by the end of the year close the
financing and start construction. It will be approximately two years to build the building six months to
lease up the residential and have the school move in the school will start serving people in 2020.

Public Session
Inspector Carlos Valdez, Commander of the 40th Police Precinct said that so does everybody here
know what Comstat is or has heard of the concept of Comstat. I had Comstat this morning and basically
Comstat they called me down specifically if there’s any increases in crime that are occurring and the 40
has had an increase in crime here to date. Basically what I said at Comstat was for the 28 day period
basically since I was here we have a 50 percent increase in crime specifically robberies, assaults,
burglaries and grand larcenies. I knew there was a segment in the Times Murder in the 40. At the time
that the article was written we had one homicide but we were actually down at that time compared to the
three that we had the previous year. The 40 is historically violent even though we had less violence last
year but we try our best to keep the violence lower. Year to date we had two shootings last time I was
here we had only one. During this past month we took two shootings on the 9th of February which
occurred over here on 151 and Morris and unfortunately this past Monday over at St. Mary’s we took a
homicide. We believe that homicide was a result of a previous assault and or other homicide. There was
a homicide a few weeks ago not in the confines of the 40. I told you about the shootings and the crime
increases especially in robberies. What we have is the NCO officers addressing the specific sectors where
the crimes are occurring. A lot of it is still youth on youth but we’re also seeing that they are robberies of
opportunity. Different from the last time when I was here where they were happening in a concentrated
specific area it’s really all over the place. Usually when we have specific areas, specific times and
specific individuals that are doing it we see patterns. But we have not created any patterns recently
because we don’t see a commonality in the crimes that are being committed. Burglaries are another issue
that is on the rise a lot of it has to do with people leaving their doors open. Sometimes it’s not forced
Pg. 2
entry at all. There are individuals that will go down the hallway and turn door knobs to see they can gain
access. Again we try to avoid this by talking to you and making sure that you secure your property and
also by looking at people that habitually commit burglaries. We did lock up an individual that wasarrested many times for burglaries that he was committing at the time we caught him he had nine arrest
numbers on him. When we see burglary spikes it’s usually the same people and that are addicted to
narcotics to sell it for whatever they can to feed their habit. Just to let you know that in every category I
discussed we have a huge increase in arrests 73 percent in robberies, 53 percent in assault arrests this time
last year we had 2 burglary arrests this year we had 9. The effort is there by the 40th Precinct we just have
to do a little better in identifying whose doing this what are they stealing and where are they selling stuff.
I actually got a location today of a business that is making deals for things that were stolen. The NCO
Officers address anything from noise complaints to narcotics sales you name it that’s the community
Officer that the Police Commissioner wants you to know.
Questions
Bronx Health Reach
Mr. Joseph Ellis, Outreach Coordinator said that I’m with the Bronx Health Reach we are the
community arm for the Institute for Family Health here to promote the NOT62 Campaign which
is a call to action by Bronx Health Reach and the Institute for Family Health and Montefiore Hospital.
For the last 6 years the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation has listed the Bronx as the most unhealthiest
county in New York State we’re trying to do something about that and we’re going to have a Town Hall
meeting on April 2nd and we’re asking Community Board 1 if they will sign on and join us. We will let
you know more about when we’re having the Town Hall meeting. We don’t have the flyers in Spanish
yet but hopefully by next week and we’re distributing them to all the Community Boards.
City Clerk’s Office of the City of New York
Ms. Jessica Fiorillo, Lobby Bureau Trainer said that I’m with the office of the City Clerk with the
Lobbying Bureau. Lobbying is an attempt to influence government. Any attempt to influence
government might need to be reported to our office. You spend $5000 thousand dollars in a calendar year
doing so. It sounds like it’s not really relevant but it is to a lot of groups if you are with a non-profit and
apply for discretionary funding, if you attempt to influence a bill, if ask the Borough President for
government funding that is lobbying. If a group spends $5000 dollars in a calendar year it has to be
reported. A lot of people don’t know that they’re lobbying so we’re offering an Amnesty period where
they can come forward and report to our office and not be penalized. This is really a great opportunity
and I’m leaving these brochures if anyone wants more information or if they just want to call our office.
Please consider it a lot of people do great work and we don’t want them fined. New York State is also
offering an Amnesty period. So this is a great opportunity to be in compliance with the City and State.
So if you have any questions you can contact the office of the City Clerk and we’ll be happy to help you.
Northeast Charter Schools Network
Mr. John Sanchez, NYC Advocacy Manager said that why am I here today well in your packet you’ll
see that we’re holding a Press Conference on March 3rd at 11:00 AM at Harriet Tubman Charter School.
Pg. 3
What’s the purpose of this Press Conference? Well the purpose is that Charter Schools do not receive
facilities funding from the state. There are some schools in the City of New York that are paying 50, 70even 100 thousand dollars a month and they get no assistance and this is money that could be used for
curriculum, computers, and extra resources. I visited a school in Brooklyn in which they had a pool that
they couldn’t renovate because they were paying $50,000 dollars a month in rent and Charter Schools are
Public Schools and what we’re seeing is that things are unequal. We have a very strange process where
some schools are getting help for rent and some schools are getting none and this is unfair. We encourage
community leaders, parents and community stake holders to attend. So the details again it’s March 3rd at
1176 Franklin Avenue and if you’d like to attend or speak you can call me at 646 – 300-5743.
Question
Ms. Maxine Davila said that last fall I was here as well as at other Community Boards talking about the
United Nations My World Survey and what I found was that a lot of people were not receptive as I
expected which was okay because I told everyone that I wouldn’t just bombard everyone with things. I’m
really here to raise awareness in education. So at the end of December I decided to completely change
my outreach approach because of you’ll notice what’s being passed around all the details. There’s going
to be so much participation from civil society and they’ll be having all types of surveys and consultations.
If we don’t know what they’re about then we’ll miss our chance. I really just want to again raise
awareness in education so you will know what you’re saying or at least know too. So I started these
Newsletters with 5 boroughs wide the agenda mandates that we reach the most marginalized communities
so I started out with the 10 most marginalized communities. You know just to go to the community
leaders first but basically I want to get everyone involved but I can’t do that alone I need your help. If
you don’t know what I’m talking about you’re not going to help me. You all have the January issue
because I wasn’t able to be here last month. I do have a February issue and if you’re interested I would
love to email you a copy. I do have 10 copies with me here in case you can’t access emails or anything
but I have this signup sheet. My organization is a grassroots initiative working for a better world. I do
not solicit anything I do work through partnerships there’s like a website that does upload my Newsletters
which is luzdavilafoundation.org.

The District Manager said that every Board Member received a copy of the Zika report by email and in
their folders at the January Board meeting. Also everyone knows the issues with standing water. We
have with us tonight our liaison from the New York City Health Department Ms. Meiling Viera-Delgado.
Ms. Meiling Viera-Delgado, Bronx Community Liaison said that my job is to ensure that all matters
that are inter-government related initiatives are brought to the 12 Community Boards here in the borough.
We have some concerns about the Zika Virus so this is a formal presentation that’s quite lengthy but I
will try to condense it as much as possible and give you the most important factors. I have flyers here in
English and Spanish we also have them in Creole and French to ensure that folks are getting the
information necessary. So the basic facts about the Zika Virus that we know currently is that folks are
being infected south of the United States in Central South America and New Mexico that’s where we
have confirmed cases. A great deal of the individuals that are stung get sick that’s really important to
note. Why is that important to note because if you go to another country the expectation is that you use
all the precautionary measures that I passed around. If you’re in a non air conditioned location that you
have bed nets that you spray your clothing and it is very important to note that you should wear long
sleeve shirts and long pants during the day. This mosquito is very different then the mosquito that begins
to sting at dusk they usually sting from dawn to dusk. So we are advising woman who are pregnant or
expecting to become pregnant if they can delay travel to other countries other than in the United States. If
they cannot delay travel we’re asking that they visit their physician prior to leaving so that everything is
okay with the pregnancy. Secondly upon returning that they also visit their physician to ensure that
they’re okay and the reason why this is so important is that there is a slight correlation between the Zika
Virus and Microcephaly. Microcephaly is the formation in children who are born with very small heads
and have developmental problems and as a result have very short life spans. The other concern is if the
male travels out of the country and is stung and returns to his spouse, girlfriend whoever it is and engages
in sexual intercourse they can give their partner the Zika Virus. If the female then becomes pregnant the
child may have Microcephaly. So we’re advising that one there’s a conversation between the partners to
either abstain for at least 2 weeks after the male returns or use condoms so that’s the advice that we’re
giving. So what are the symptoms they are muscle aches, and fever similar to the flu and it has the pink
eye associated with it. There is no treatment and there is no vaccine at the moment. That we continue to
be mindful of our ponding water and it should be removed to ensure that we continue to reduce
mosquito’s because we still have mosquito’s that carry other types of diseases.
Questions
Unfortunately last summer as you well know this district was struck by Legionnaires Disease a very
unfortunate situation and we lost 13 individuals in this community and we had 123 people get sick. We
currently have a situation here so I want to give you a little bit of history and policy as it relates to what
we do when we find Legionnaires so it can live in mist and warm water. We had a situation here in the
South Bronx where you had a unit dispelling bacteria into the air. We understand that Legionnaires is not
a man made or created disease it’s something that lives in our environment all the time. So it could be in
standing water, hot water, in the plumbing it could live in your supermarket on what’s sprayed on your
Pg. 5
vegetables. Unfortunately 80 percent of the individuals that become sick are those who have symptoms
that create susceptible situations such as problems with their upper respiratory and those who have bonemarrow and different organ transplants become sick faster. I understand that right now we have a
situation here that some folks are concerned about. The Department of Health when we find one case in a
building or in a location we do not immediately begin an investigation because that could be that you
traveled somewhere and you got sick. I cannot determine that this one illness was in this building. Now
when we have a second case that’s associated with the same address then you know that there’s
something going on in that building. So I’m going to use Community Board 1 and hope this never
happens God forbid I come in with Legionnaires I go home and get treated with antibiotics and then
hopefully not Mr. Loftin get sick then somebody from the Department of Health comes out and
investigates and does a full fledged interview with the patient. We ask where did you go to the Doctor,
where have you been, where do you live, how do you shower, what do you do and their asking both of us
the same questions. If our answers correlate to the same location then that’s where the investigation is
propelled. But if Mr. Loftin and I don’t have any correlation in terms as to where we commute and where
we live then we need to figure out if something else is going on and that becomes environmental. So
right now we have a situation where we have 2 cases one was originally correlated to the South Bronx
outbreak and then there’s another one that happened now and we know that they both live in the same
location. So why weren’t they associated then because the second one we didn’t know about. The cost of
the tests and remediation will become the burden of the property owner the City does not pay for any
services rendered the Department of Health is not a service provider.
Questions
Elected Officials Reports
Ms. Farhan Hassan representative for the State Senator Jose M. Serrano said that earlier this
evening I passed around our Community Board Report and the flyers for an event we’re having. So first
and foremost I want to thank those that came out to our annual Black History Month Event this past
Monday with Congressman Serrano’s office. I know our former honoree Ms. Nellie McKay came out
and whoever else did from the Board we always love having you so thank you. This past month we
focused a lot on providing free tax services for the entire district. We’re going to end it with a free tax
event at our district office this Friday and it’s by appointment only the flyers are going around now. You
can make an appointment to have your taxes filed for free with Ariva an organization that the City has
contracted to provide these services. If you know anyone that hasn’t filed their taxes yet let them know
that it’s completely free and they just have to call our office to make an appointment. It’s from 10 to 3 so
we have slots for everyone. Next month we’re coming into March and we will be focusing on
Immigration Services and will be partnering with the Mayor’s Office for Immigration Affairs as well as
the Manhattan DA’s Office for free immigration legal services. I don’t have those flyers with me right
now. I don’t know if you guys heard the Mayor’s Office launched a new program basically offering free
legal services for anyone who needs it so. They’ll make you an appointment with the local community
organization providing it and I believe its BronxWorks so you don’t have to look out for our flyers in
particular you can also reach out to BronxWorks offering the free legal services starting this spring. So
stay tuned for those flyers.
Ms. Gloria Cruz representative for the Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito said that this is our
flyer for this month our address and phone number is in the back it’s a lot of information but two of the
things I want to highlight we have free NYCHA Legal Clinic. Anyone that has issues with NYCHA they
can go there to our 116th Street office. We’re working in getting it to the Bronx but for now they can go
Pg. 6
to 116th Street the second Tuesday of every month so they can get legal representation for what’s going on
in their NYCHA development. Also the Speaker was able to put up these beautiful murals and we haveone on 138th and Grand Concourse so one of these four murals was ours. Participatory Budgeting is on
full swing and we should be getting to vote very soon. I encourage that you go to her website and learn
about the projects that we’re about to release with 2 million set aside this year.

Chairman and District Manager’s Report
The District Manager Cedric L. Loftin introduced Inspector Carlos Valdez Commander of the 40th
Precinct.
Pg. 2Inspector Carlos Valdez Commander of the 40th Police Precinct said that I’m the new Commanding
Officer of the 40th Precinct I was assigned here July 22nd. I apology for taking so long to come and meet
everyone here I’ve met a few people and there are a some familiar faces but the Police Department had
sent me to what is called a Police Management Institute Course given by Columbia University and what it
entailed was since the beginning of last year I was scheduled to go away upstate where they give this
course for a week at a time. Unfortunately it coincided every time there was a meeting here so I heard
that some people were looking for me that’s the reason why I haven’t been able to attend it’s hard to be
two places at once. But now that I’ve completed that course it’s over basically I had to give a
presentation to the Police Commissioner or my group does on how to improve the department. So I just
wanted to get that out of the way so I don’t want anyone to think that I was dodging the Community
Board.
A little background on myself I am coming up on twenty-six years in the department I’m originally from
Queens. My parents migrated here from Peru they met here I’m one of three brothers and my father
currently resides in the Bronx so I do have some ties to the borough. I started off as a young Transit cop
here in District 11 and I as a young Sergeant here in PSA7 I was the Crime Sergeant for a couple of years
the majority of my career has been spent in the Emergency Service Unit I think a lot of people know that
as SWAT. But when I made Captain that’s when I left that part of my career and started off as an
Executive at PSA2 I’ve previously commanded PSA1 and prior to coming to the 40 was Commander of
the 61 Precinct. So this is my third Command. I’m very happy to be here and very familiar with the
neighborhood. The Officers in the 40 Precinct are the best you can find anywhere they’re very hard
working and dedicated. So I do appreciate being here very much.
Just to let you know what happened last year in the 40 Precinct. Unfortunately we did have a big crime
increase overall. We led the City percentage wise in crime 24 and a half percent increase altogether by
December 31st and of the seven major categories except for Grand Larceny in automobiles we were up in
everything robberies, rapes, homicides in every category. The positive things that happened the
command was down in violence we were down eight percent in shootings last year which is a good effort
going in the right direction. I think a lot of that had to do with the amount of guns the 40 Precinct took
off the streets they took close to 130 guns this last year. Again this is a reflection on the hard work that
the Officers in the Precinct do. We did have a takedown of two major crews in the Mott Haven and
Patterson Houses the first week of December. It was a long term investigation that was started by my
predecessor Lorenzo Johnson and with the help of Narcotics which was headed by a former 40 CO
Inspector Chris McCormick. The investigation went on for about a year and a half we were able to put
away 49 very, very bad people through Federal Indictment which means that these people will not be
seeing the light of day anytime soon. They were locked up for robberies, shootings, homicides and
narcotics. So it was a good take down and we got a lot of positive feedback from the community and
although there were 49 arrests they weren’t all picked up the first of the year about 20 of them were
picked up two months prior to the take down. So that’s one thing that’s good. So far this year we do
have one shooting it happened on the first of the year approximately 2:30 in the morning by 135th Street.
We really don’t think that it’s anything retaliatory that it has nothing to do with the 40 the individual that
was shot was actually from the 46 at a local bar or restaurant on Bruckner Boulevard. He was not from
this area but it so happens that he got shot here. Now what’s going on new in the 40 it’s been prevalent
throughout the City now and it started up in the Rockaway’s and the 33 and 34 in Manhattan and we just
started the program here two weeks ago called the Neighborhood Community Officers Program (NCO).
What’s happened really is that the whole Precinct has been restructured. Before this the Precinct was
broken down to 11 different sectors and I had a whole variety of specialized units schools, narcotics,
conditions and things of that nature. So what the department came up with this new program we broke
down the 40 Precinct into 4 different sectors and we assigned these NCO Officers to each sector and
Pg. 3along with these NCO Officers we’re going to have dedicated Officers assigned to each sector. The basis
for this is for you to get to know your community Police Officer. Commissioner Bratton and Chief
O’Neal what to bring some sort of community outreach back. I brought with me today Sergeant
Feigenbaum my NCO Supervisor Sergeant in charge of the 8 NCO’s in the 40 Precinct there are 2
assigned to each sector. So if you’re having any problems reach out to the Sergeant and these Officers
and they will try to address that as much as possible and if they cannot they will bring it to my attention
and if we have to resource the problem out if its narcotics or gangs then we will do so. It’s a program that
so far has gotten back a lot of positive feedback in the other Precincts that have been running it for awhile
and we look forward to continuing that progress. The Commissioner doesn’t want this to become a
specialty department they want a well rounded Officer one that can address all your issues not just
narcotics, not just gangs but they want the Officers to address all issues. So one thing it did I had to
reassign all these Officers that were in specialty units and they’re back on patrol. In essence I have a lot
more Officers out on patrol then I did just three weeks ago. So that is the one thing that not only this
Precinct has going on but of course the department does also. I think that’s really what I have going on
right now. Once again I look forward to being here. I enjoy my time here it is a challenge every day and
I have very dedicated Officers. I started in the Bronx and I’ve always liked the Bronx.
Questions
The New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer said that for those of you who don’t know me I’m
Scott Stringer the City Comptroller. You elected me two years ago and I’ve been making my way to
Boards all over the City and the reason I go to the Boards is because I understand very clearly that the
heart and soul of community is defined by a Community Board the people who come out to meetings and
the people who serve for no money but serve the community every month. Think about how many people
the Community Board represents and how few people are on the Board and come out to the meeting to
watch out for your neighbors and for your community and I want to thank you for that. When I was the
Manhattan Borough President I worked very closely with Community Boards. I do believe very strongly
that if you are smart to want to learn what’s happening that you will come to the Community Board. So
that’s why I’m here tonight. I want to tell you just a little bit about what I’m doing. Also for you to know
there’s a lot I want to do with you. Part of the job of Comptroller is to do a couple of things first I work
very closely with City Hall I’m the Chief Fiscal Officer and we work with the Mayor. While working
with the Mayor I’m also the Auditor so just when he wants to put his arms around me and say I love my
Comptroller that’s when it gets complicated right. That’s a good thing because you need checks and
balances. Nobody is right all the time and nobody is wrong all the time. My job is t watch out for the
people in this City and for the last two years we have spent a lot of time doing something that has never
been done before we have gone into the New York City Housing Authority with seven audits looking at
finances. Because unless we protect his valuable housing stock this City is going to become a City for
very wealthy people maybe enclaves for the poor people but the aspirations of NYCHA will not exist in
the next ten to twenty years we have to say that it is very serious. Today we have said for the first time
that NYCHA must be funded there is a $17 billion dollar deficit. The answer can’t be infill development
luxury units. What we need to do is find new revenue streams and one of the things I’ve proposed is to
take you know Battery Park City in lower Manhattan they actually provide a lot of money and it’s been an
agreement that the City gets some of those proceeds. I’m now saying that we should take $400 million
dollars of that money and spread it out over ten years so that we know that NYCHA is getting the first
dedicated funding stream. That is something that I want you to support because we have to invest in
NYCHA. The reason we have to invest is because if we don’t take care of the capital needs of NYCHA
then we’re going to have more people living in homeless shelters. Eighteen thousand people are now
living in our shelters but get this I believe that three thousand of them are children. In this day and age in
Pg. 4a City that its fiscal health is as good as it’s ever been now today we’re stronger than ever but many
people are sleeping in homeless shelters. I know this means a lot to many of you because you have kids
and grandkids. We can’t have the babies in the shelters and part of what I’m doing now is going shelter
by shelter and the investigations are showing that these shelters have thousands of violations. Some of
the people that live in shelters live with rats, rodents and a whole lot of other creatures 86 percent of the
shelters I looked at had housing code violations this is serious and hazardous these violations have to be
fixed. We’re now working with HRA Commissioner and the Mayor to finally fix these shelters. No one
was looking at the invisible City and that’s what has been happening with the shelter system. I’m focused
on NYCHA and the shelter system.
We also have to make sure that we claim and economic pipeline for our children let’s face it our kids are
the smartest and most diverse these kids that go to our Public Schools need resources. We’ve got to own
the high tech economy and make sure that our kids benefit from that. We can’t just have the
entrepreneurs here and we’re not preparing our kids. When I became Comptroller we did a report on Arts
Education and we found that places like the South Bronx right here in this community there weren’t
enough Arts Education Teachers and that was true in Central Brooklyn. Working with the Mayor we are
now investing in Arts Education Teachers. Things have changed now in Arts Education and Engineering
you can get a job that pay $75 thousand dollars our kids can get right to middle class they don’t even
have to go up the ladder. In this high tech economy they’re going to make it and we need to prepare our
children for Arts, Engineering and Science Teachers and we need our kids to benefit. That is where I’m
coming from as Comptroller. We have to help the children and we also have to help the people that are
suffering in our shelters and those who are living in NYCHA as they’ve helped build up their
communities. You can’t let them down and you can’t talk about building affordable housing and leave
NYCHA behind. You can’t build and forget who built up the neighborhood and that’s what this agenda’s
got to be about. I just want to say we’re going to work with all of you.

Pg. 5Ms. Gloria Cruz representative of the Council Speaker Melissa Mark Viverito said that I hope
everyone has our News Letter. There are just two things I want to touch base on Participatory Budgeting
is one. We are now picking the projects to be able to be on the voting ballot. We also have fiscal year
2017 applications and it’s on the website. As you know District 17 has an empty seat and Melissa want to
reassure everybody in the community that there are still people working there to serve the community. So
she will be at the District 17’s office for a Melissa meet up on February 17th from 5:00 to 7:00 to reassure
this community that they will still be served until they get a new Councilperson. Any concerns or
complaints please feel free to call and I will do my best to fix the problem.
Mr. Ramon Cabral representative for Congressman Jose E. Serrano said that I’m here to assure you
that the Federal Government is not your enemy. There are people working against you and that’s
unfortunate but Congressman Serrano is working for you all and definitely for housing. As of now we’ve
recently sent a letter to the Secretary of HUD to kind of figure out what we can do for the AMI. AMI is
big issue now with the Housing Plan and it doesn’t show what the actual income is in the Bronx because
it’s including Westchester and Long Island. Because of this the income goes up to what’s not reality. So
we recently sent a letter to HUD asking them if they could figure out another way to determine the AMI
in the Bronx either by Zip Code or district but we are working on that. The second thing is that we have
an even on February 23rd, Tuesday from 10:00 to 12:00 PM it’s celebrating Black History Month at
Hostos Community College. If you want more information you can call our office at 718 – 620-0084.
Ms. Rayna Taylor representative for Assemblyman Michael Blake said that I’m here to tell you about
two events coming up. So we’re having a Civil Rights Round Table taking place on February 3rd at 6:00
PM in our office at 777 Concourse Village East and discussing issues of people with criminal

have some type of program to help the elderly and disabled with snowplowing. Lastly she is also

So it appears that is spreading from South America and Central America to the United States. The flyer

Public Session
New York City Department of Consumer Affairs
Mr. Felipe Luciano said that I’m with the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs and we have
a new law coming up on January 1, 2016 called the Commuter Benefits Law. Now this is how it goes if
you have twenty or more employees full-time within the five boroughs of New York City they are eligible
for Transit Benefit Tax up to $400 dollars a year which means money comes out of your gross not your
net income so you can save a lot of money. Even if you’re undocumented you’re still eligible under these
laws. You’re not qualified for the Commuter Benefits Law if you’re part of a union, part-time or seasonal
employee.
So you can call us at 311 my number is 212-536-0157 or email me fluciano@dca.nyc.gov and the website
is nyc.gov/commuter benefits and we have an alphabetical list of providers that you can connect your
payroll company to. Once you kick this program off it runs on its own.

Pg. 2Big Brothers Big Sisters
Ms. Ariane Cohen said that I’m on the Recruitment and Outreach Team of Big Brothers Big Sisters of
NYC and you may remember that my co-worker came earlier in the year and talked about how were
expanding into the outer boroughs with a grant from the City Council. So what I’m here to tell you
tonight is that we are planning a Meet and Greet with the Community Board in this area and we want to
hold it the second to last week in January and all the Community Board Members are welcome to come.
We want to work on a partnership with the Community Board and the organizations here in the area in
order to better offer our resources to the kids in the area and we hope to work with you to make that
happen. So at the Meet and Greet we will provide food and it will be a good chance to meet our team to
work with us and help us better serve this community.
Questions and Answers
Nos Quedamos/We Stay
Ms. Jessica Clemente said that I came to share some information briefly. First off as you all know
already our City Council Member Arroyo will be resigning as of the 31st of this month. As a result her
position will be open for a Special Election. I felt and my team felt that this is a really important time for
us to step up and put together what we feel would be necessary in a Candidate Forum. We’re already in
the process of setting up some preliminary details of which I’m going to share this evening. I’m saying
this to open the floor that everyone knows that we’re looking to hold a Candidate Forum in this district
we want to include as many stake holders. To date to my knowledge there are six potential candidates so
the candidate quota is large. I believe the election will take place on February 16th so that’s only forty-
five days from the day she announces is what make this so important. We’re approaching the holidays
and if families don’t know that she’s resigning the whole Special Election opportunity for them to engage
and get out and vote will be missed and so that’s super imperative. We all know that a large part of the
proposals that come through here go through and are decided by the City Council so this position is very
critical. So it’s a real opportunity to get engaged and hear from those that want to assume the role of our
representative and see exactly what they bring to the table. We’re looking at various locations and
January 20th is the date that we’re targeting. It’s a quick turn-around for us to try and pull off but it at
least gives us four weeks between the Candidate Forum and the Election to continue with outreach and
getting the word out. I’m going to need everyone’s help here at the table with outreach and also with the
turn out because again you want to make sure that it’s focused on the issues of community development,
open space, housing and social justice issues. So it’s not going to be like an open conversation we want
to hit all the highlights and all the issues that are really at unrest in our communities.
So to recap we’re looking at Hostos and a few other locations its non partisan and the date is January 20th
most likely from 6:00 to 8:00. We will open at 6:00 and the program will start at 6:30 and will be
open to any of the respective candidates and of course any available stake holders are welcome to join us
either in the logistic planning in the front side or the back side we need help all around. The outreach
effort has to be a big one letting community members know. I also want to make a concerted effort to
have translators at the Candidate Forum so that our members who only speak one language can also be
able to participate. I’ll have a flyer Save the Date once the location is confirmed but I wanted to make
sure that you were the first to know. These are decisions we made as of last week. In January we
have our Three Kings celebration which is also a coat drive and we welcome everyone to come.

Chairman and District Managers Report
The District Manager Mr. Cedric L. Loftin introduced the New York City Parks Department Bronx
Borough Commissioner Ms. Iris Rodriguez-Rosa whom would be speaking about Parks Without Borders.
Ms. Iris Rodriguez-Rosa said that I think this is very important and we’re trying to get to all the
Community Boards and you’re the first. So I just wanted to tell you that for me it’s an honor a privilege
and I’ve sat on many boards with your Chairperson. It’s wonderful for me to be back here in the borough
as the Borough Commissioner. I was also a former District Manager for a Community Board in Brooklyn
for six years so I know how important a Community Board is and the time you dedicate to public service
it’s to be respected. So I personally wanted to come here just to say hello to all of you. So I’m here to
serve you in any capacity that I can in your parks. So without further ado the purpose of coming here was
to have Mr. Hernandez talk about Parks Without Borders that Commissioner Silver wanted to share with
you.
Mr. Eduardo Hernandez said that I’m the Park District Manager for Districts 1, 4 and 5. Parks Without
Borders is a new approach to park design that focuses on three main goals. It starts with that
neighborhoods should be more unified and with fewer boundaries around public spaces. To achieve this
is to make more welcoming and accessible parks by the opening up of entrances and edges; expanding the
beauty of parks into the neighborhood; and transforming underutilized spaces into centers of community
activity. We are looking to widen entrances and move them to corners to align with where people
approach the park by adding amenities such as entry plazas and seating. Looking to lower fences and
improve visibility into and out of the park and to add seating, street trees and other amenities along the
park edges for to activate them and bring the beauty of the park out into the neighborhood. To open park
adjacent spaces where they are fenced off and to add amenities targeting spaces with good connections to
institutions such as libraries and museum.
Pg. 4The new design approach will applied wherever we can to the approximately 450 project we are already
committed to doing. Wherever we are reconstructing a playground of basketball court we will be looking
for opportunities to open those parks making them more connected to the neighborhood. There are now
43 projects that we have incorporated the PWB design concept within the five boroughs and will continue
to do so wherever we can on all new capital construction. Wherever it is appropriate there will be
additional resources added from the Parks Without Borders program to expand the scope of certain
projects to advance PWB goals.
We are now looking for eight sites for new Parks Without Borders projects. If you know of a group that
has a particular interest in a park send them to Parks Without Borders. The three main criteria for the
eight new parks to be selected are Community support, advocacy through the website for individuals or
groups and the parks current layout, condition and relation to its surroundings. We have a website
nyc.gov\parks\pwb that will allow people to suggest parks for consideration and for to make any
suggestions for improvement to our parks.
Questions and Answers
Police Officer Espada said good evening ladies and gentlemen sorry I’m late I was just giving out about
500 toys in the community and yesterday we gave out another 500 hundred at Lincoln Hospital we had a
wonderful turnout. I want to tell you guys thank you for making 2015 a good one and I think in my
opinion a better one for the 40 precinct hopefully next year we will make it even that much better for us
and the community for as I said before I consider myself part of the community. Please be safe during the
holidays and not lose our common sense if you know what I mean when it comes to not being as careful
and vigilant as we should be especially with the cell phones. Just use very simple strategies to prevent
you from being a victim. Like I said we’re working on an initiative with Mr. Loftin within the next
couple of weeks on these pedestrian accidents to try and come up with strategies to make it safer for
people and keep more accidents from happening on 138th Street and Bruckner. I want to wish you guys a
happy holiday.

Elected Officials Reports
Mr. Andy Toledo the representative for the Bronx Borough President said that I think most of you guys
should have gotten the reappointment letters. If you haven’t gotten it you should be getting it very soon
please fill it out and submit it and if you’re not reapplying please contact Tom Lucania to let him know.
If you know of anyone interested in serving on the Community Board applications are now available on
the Borough President’s website where you can download them and then you will be called in January for
a brief interview. Just to kind of piggyback on the squatter issue we’ve been experiencing it in the office
and I know that a lot of people are strapped for cash and you might think of renting out an extra room.
But if you do be very careful because if you rent out space and that person is there for 30 days they would
Pg. 5end up getting squatter rights so be very careful. Lastly on behalf of the Bronx Borough President I just
want to thank the Board Members for an incredible 2015 and your positive work. I think that for the
foreseeable future I will be the liaison here so any questions or concerns you can forward to my attention.
I want to wish everybody happy holidays.
Mr. Jose Ramon-Perez-Lopez the representative for State Senator Jose M. Serrano said I just want to
say from our staff and the Senator happy holidays. I distributed his Community Report and remind you
that every Tuesday in a Community Center or Public Library we have Constituent Hours. Last month we
partnered with the Legal Aid Society to help tenants with their rights and in dealing with Landlords. This
coming January we are partnering with the Department of Health to speak about health and well being to
our community. So we will be providing information about health and wellness during our Constituent
Hours.
Ms. Mariel de la Cruz the representative for the Comptroller Scott Stringer said that I just wanted to
report on a few things. First of all happy holidays. One of the things that the Comptroller has been
working on is an investigation of discrimination of housing for a lot of folks especially when they have
vouchers. We saw on a few websites if you’re homeless or have this voucher you need not apply. So
that’s an issue because you’re supposed to be able to get housing and we’re looking into that a little
further. Another thing is that a lot of folks read our analysis on the East New York Rezoning, the
Comptroller gave a few points on what it will look like in that area and that there should be a lot more
community involvement. Another thing is that it should be neighborhood by neighborhood and not one
play that says one size fits all and the income for affordable housing should be what the community looks
like everyone deserves housing. Then the last thing is that there was a Press Conference in which there
was a presentation on NYCHA and the issue was there not being ready for emergencies that might occur.
Ms. Jessica Reynoso the representative for the Public Advocate Letitia James said that the she has
launched the worst Landlord list on the website which is www.landlordwatchlist.com. The number one
on the list has a building over here at 750 Grand Concourse. The Public Advocate also sued NYCHA for
violating health administrative codes. Happy holidays everyone.

The District Manager Cedric L. Loftin said that last month they had briefly spoken about the 40th

received no response back. However the Commander did attend my District Service Cabinet meeting
since his training is over. He has been training to become a Chief. He sat down to talk about some things
and is aware about all the issues that Officer Espada has been dealing with. One of the things we talked
about was the squatters of which the Building Department and Fire Department are also looking into.
Police Officer Espada said just be advised that you might not see him because he has been going through
a lot of training but he’s very aware and definitely addressing every condition and issue going on at the
40th. I don’t know if anybody’s read but we had a big take down recently about a week ago. We took out
a lot of people that were not doing the right thing in the community.
The District Manager Cedric L. Loftin said that six months ago when Deputy Inspector Johnson was
here I told you that there were things happening that I could not talk about but it’s now gone through the
process. This was not state but federal.

Chairman and District Manager’s Report
The District Manager said that we have a presentation tonight from the Department of City Planning on
two Text Amendments of the Mandatory Inclusionary Housing and Zoning for Quality and Affordability.
These items have come before the entire City of New York. They are voting items for all fifty-nine
Citywide Community Boards. There are twelve Boards in the Bronx and we are required to vote under
the City Charter.
We started this process previously during the last 6 months and have had three presentations by Mr. Paul
Philps Planner for the Department of City Planning. Everyone should have received a copy of these Text
Amendment items by email. The Board Members should now be receiving a copy of the two items whichPg. 2
are HPD tools being passed out in both English and Spanish. Mr. Philps has been our Planner for awhile
and he is one of the top.
Mr. Paul Philps, Senior Planner for the Department of City Planning said that there are two Citywide
Text Amendments that you will be voting on tonight. The first one is Mandatory Inclusionary Housing
and the other Zoning for Quality and Affordability. I know that the Committee Members have heard this
several times. It is important to note that these are two separate Text Amendments.
The first Text Amendment is for Mandatory Inclusionary Housing a Citywide action. It is important to
know that these Text Amendments will be part of the Zoning Resolution. So if a private Developer
comes to the Board for an up zoning it has to be more than the 12,500 square foot increase or more than
10 units of housing that would be required and mandatory. That means that there are three options the
first is 23 percent of the units at an average of 60 percent AMI; and the other is an average of 30 percent
at 80 percent AMI. So it would be one of those two options and the third option which is the Workforce
option. It is important to note that there is no subsidy with the Workforce option. The Workforce option
would always be paired with option one or two so this would be mandatory. Right now the program is
Voluntary. Also important is that these units are permanently affordable. It is also important to note that
previously you could provide units on one site and then you could also preserve units off site at another
building to meet your affordable housing requirements but with this program you have to build new units
so preservation is being taken care of through the New York City Housing Preservation and Development
(HPD). This Text Amendment requires that you build new units. The other important component of the
Mandatory Inclusionary Housings this is an option for example if you have between ten to twenty-five
units and not able to provide affordable housing you’d pay into a fund which HPD would manage and
would be used to provide affordable housing in your community district. Another option is that they
could go to the BSA and get variances for hardship and prove through a hardship that you would not be
able to provide affordable housing on your site. Those are the basic components of the Text Amendment.
The second one is Zoning for Quality and Affordability. There are three basic components to the Zoning
for Quality and Affordability. One is willing to increase production for senior housing we know that
seniors are going to grow tremendously in the City of New York. Overall there’s going to be an increase
in the City of New York of over 400 thousand people and seniors are going to make a very large portion
of those. We’re not creating enough housing to keep up with the seniors that need housing. One of the
things we want to do in the Text is that we put in a level playing field for all types there’s independent
living, assisted living, and continuing care. So this Text Amendment would allow all of these uses to be
in the same building. For example you come in independent living and a few years down the line you
may need an attendant or something you could stay in that same building and get the kind of care that you
need. So that’s really important to be able to give seniors more options. Another thing that we found as
part of this proposal is the envelopes that in a zoning district you can build to a certain height and you
have to prescribe to the certain requirements of the zoning. What we’re doing is adjusting the heights in
most districts for the most part it’s anywhere from 5 to 10 feet. What this is allowing is being able to
maximize floor to ceiling areas. A couple of other things we’re doing in terms of the height back in the
early 1900’s we had more generous floor to ceiling heights anywhere from 10 feet to maybe 12 feet. As
you’ve seen over time there have been much smaller floor to ceiling heights 8 feet is about the average
right now. What we want to do with the Text Amendment is mandate that at a minimum that it be 10 feet
floor to ceiling heights. We want to mandate on the ground floors it be at least 15 feet. This is important
because as you’ve seen and I know that there’s actually some buildings around here that the ground floor
is not easy to tenant and one of the issues is that the floor to ceiling heights are not really being built to
accommodate good retail spaces so we want improve the quality of the retail creating a minimum of 15Pg. 3
feet on the ground floor. Also want to improve the quality of the housing being built by having a
minimum standard of 10 feet from floor to ceiling for residential use. We’re trying to create the
maximum number of affordable units.
Questions and Answers
Ms. Arline Parks, Chairperson of the Economic Development-Land Use & Housing Committee said
that with these Text Amendments developers will not be able to include parking spaces in their project
plans and that the money being saved will not be put into increasing the building units but into their
pockets. Therefore we couldn’t support this in its present form.
The Chairman called for a motion on the Mandatory Inclusionary Housing and Zoning for Quality
and Affordability Text Amendments.

Elected Officials
Mr. Andy Toledo representative of the Bronx Borough President said that your vote has been duly
noted and will be presented to the Borough President and we will vote as a collective unit in the borough
on the 19th and it will be presented to the Mayor’s Office. I want to draw everybody attention on this very
good report that was produced by the Department of Labor and our office played a small role in that. It
discusses the unemployment numbers here in the Bronx and the dramatic reduction in numbers. Just to
give you a quick synopsis for January 2010 the unemployment rate in the Bronx was 14.1 percent and we
are currently standing as of last month at 6.6 percent unemployment rate. So there’s a lot of dramatic
reduction, a lot of investment, a lot of jobs produced in the borough in our education facilities, hospitals
and health, and manufacturing that hire many of our Bronx residents. The fourth engine that is really
starting to make a dent here in the Bronx happens to be the Tech Industry. There are a lot of startup Tech
Companies that are calling the Bronx home in Hunts Point and Port Morris they’ve taken up shop there.
The Tech Industry is hiring a lot of our Bronx residents. There’s a lot of talent in this borough and jobs
available in coding and data processing if this is something that you’re interested in. The last industry
that’s making a dent is in construction that is starting to pick up again in major projects that are coming to
this borough in particular this Community Board. There are construction jobs starting to ramp up in this
borough. So if you’re interested in reading the entire report you could look into the Borough President’s
of the Department of Labor websites for the full report.
Just want to share with you guys several program events we’re having our Halloween event at the Classic
Community Center 286 East 156th Street from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM on Saturday, October 31st. I also wantPg. 4
to share with everybody we have our Savor the Bronx Restaurant Week on November 2nd through
November 13th. It’s an event we put together every year through our Tourism Council to promote tourism
in the borough. So during that week there are about 40 restaurants participating here in the Bronx. You
can get a lunch or a meal at a discount price. You can visit I Love the Bronx.com it has the full list of all
the restaurants participating and you can also download the discount vouchers that can present at the end
of your meal. This is really a great opportunity to promote the restaurants and our borough. So definitely
support our restaurants here I the borough. Lastly on Thursday, November 19th the Puerto Rican Heritage
Month celebration will be held from 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM at the Salsa Con Fuego Restaurant. Flyers on
all events are in the back.
Ms. Minerva Medina the representative of State Senator Rev. Ruben Diaz said good evening and I’m
here representing the Senator. We’re located on 900 Rogers Place on East 163rd Street. If you have any
questions or concerns I have my business cards you can contact our office. We will be having a Veterans
Parade on November 7th.
Ms. Farhana Hassan the representative of State Senator Jose M. Serrano said I’m the Community
Liaison for State Senator Serrano. Tonight I wanted to share with you guys our November Constituent
Hours. It’s going to be in joint with the Legal Aid Society and Arriva. Tonight there’s been great
discussion around affordable housing, tenant’s rights and with that the Senator wanted to invite Legal Aid
and Arriva to provide legal resources for our folks in the Community. Constituents can meet with Legal
Aid on harassment from their landlords, unsanitary living situations or just rent stabilized issues with
apartments. In terms of Arriva they are a non-profit and they have a Financial Counseling program that is
actually funded through the City to help residents or constituents to apply for these new affordable
housing units. So you hear about all these buildings popping up now how do you qualify? A lot of people
in our community especially don’t know how to go through the process, don’t have great credit or just are
not up on their finances. This program through Arriva helps people get their credit in check, and their
finances together and helps them apply for these affordable housing units. The counseling sessions with
Legal Aid and Arriva are free. So definitely come to our off-site Constituent Hours if you guys don’t
know we’re at the Libraries and Senior Centers so you don’t have to come to our office in Harlem.
Questions and Answers
Ms. Rayna Taylor the representative of Assemblyman Michael Blake said I’m the Community
Liaison for Assemblyman Michael Blake and we have an event going on right now tonight it ends at 9:00
PM and it’s called Liquid Tech. It’s an organization to connect Bronxites with tech jobs. After that we’re
going to have a celebration at Charlie’s on Lincoln Avenue. Then on Friday the 30th we’re going to have
an African Community Listening session with African Leaders from the community hearing concerns and
that’s going to be at our office 780 Concourse Village West, Bronx, New York. You can RSVP by
calling the number or email on the flyer in the back. We’re also going to be having a veterans event I
November I don’t have the details on that when I do I will definitely let all you guys know.
Ms. Mariel de la Cruz representative of the New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer said how’s
everyone doing I’m very excited to hear folks concerns about the zoning because that’s really important
for the community. So nearly1.5 million New Yorkers are living in overcrowded homes. So the number
of 3 or more people living in a Studio jumped by 39 percent. So you just think about those things when
thinking about affordability. The medium rent paid by people living in crowded apartments grew nearly 5Pg. 5
times faster than their medium income. So those are concerns and most of the overcrowded are 1 and 1
eighth Studio apartments and it’s significantly higher than every other borough. Folks here have the
highest eviction rate in the City. So we have to consider that when we’re thinking about making
decisions about our future for young people and also the seniors.
I talked about Take it to the Bank and one of the concerns last month was that a lot of the Banks don’t
provide the services that we need. So it’s something that I’m looking into and it might take me awhile but
I didn’t forget so that everyone knows. Another thing that I wanted to mention is we’re having an African
Immigrant Heritage event on November 10th at 8:30 AM at New Settlement Community Center 1501
Jerome Avenue. It’s a breakfast and what that is, is just an opportunity for people to speak to their local
Elected Officials about concerns in the African community. It’s a fast growing population and we want to
make sure that people are getting services that they need. So if anyone’s interested in going or have any
idea of who I can invite to this event feel free to let me know.
Questions and Answers
Ms. Jessica Reynoso representative of the New York City Public Advocate said just to give you an
update of what Tish has done so far I’ve mentioned before that she had some issues with the Nail Salons.
So she is going to lodge a pilot program with some advisors to check out the Nail Salon environment to
make sure that everything is okay and it will launched in January. Another thing that she has worked on
is that the Public Advocate has announced her support in divesting New York City Pension dollars from
fossil fuels. She also is calling upon Congress to restore the Zadroga Act which provides needed health
benefits for 9/11 first responders. Something that’s not on the updated Newsletter that recently Tish had a
lawsuit against ACS and OCFS thank God her and with help from Governor Cuomo we had a settlement
which means that OCFS and ACS make a commitment to reform, has an appointment of a monitor, an
appointment of a New York City Research Expert and implementation of a correction action plan. So
everything came out positive. Hopefully OCFS and ACS will be doing their job.
Ms. Gloria Cruz representative of Council Speaker Melissa Mark Viverito said good evening
everyone. We finally passed the law for the K2 a drug that has been hurting a lot of people in our
community. So the law has been passed and people that are caught selling K2 will be fined up to $5,000
dollars. Then she has her event in the Marqueta. We didn’t have anything printed up but you could
always go to the City Council website and you can find all that information there. Her Follow Me
Friday’s is there. I urge everyone in the community to utilize 311 because Commissioners hate the 311
complaints and if they don’t answer you than you can come to us and we can advocate on your behalf.

Public Session
African Advisory Council
Mr. Charles Cooper, Chairman said that first I would like to thank the Chairman, District
Manager and the rest of the Board Members. I understand what it means to be on a Board
because I myself at one time served as Vice-Chair of Community Board 9.
I am the Chair of the Bronx African Advisory Council for the Bronx Borough President Ruben
Diaz. I speak on behalf of the council and bring you guys greetings and to kind of inform you all
of the work that we’re doing on the council and what we’re looking to do in September. The
council represents 120,000 Africans in the Bronx. The Bronx actually has the largest
concentration of Africans and we’re growing in numbers.
Six years ago the Borough President realized that the numbers were not decreasing and he
needed a way to create a conduit between the African community and the Borough President soPg. 2
he initiated the African Advisory Council. Our main goal moving forward is to do greater
outreach to the community such as with the Community Board because we’re looking to partner
up with the various committees on Community Board 1.
My goal is to start this initial conversation to introduce myself, the council and let you guys
know that we’re here to partner with the community and work with you all moving forward.
New York City Department of Consumer Affairs
Ms. Tanjila Rahman said that I’m here to talk about the Paid Sick Leave Law has anyone seen
the ad we’re getting them on bus systems on line, TV and in the subways. So the city passed the
first Sick Leave Law and it took effect on April 1st. What that means is that it pretty much
covers about a million New Yorkers under this law which gives them the right to use sick leave
for the care and treatment of themselves or a family member. Sick leave is accrued 1 hour for
every 30 hours worked. So if you have five or more employees and they work more than 80
hours in a calendar year the employer must give them up to 40 hours which is up to five days
sick leave.
The employer can require up to 7 days advance notice when employees know they will be using
sick leave. An employee may be required to give notice as soon as possible to the employer
when they do not know that they will be using sick leave.
An employer can ask for documentation from a licensed health provider is the employee uses
more than 3 consecutive sick leave days. But city law prohibits an employer from requiring the
health care provider to specify the medical reason for the sick leave.
An employee can carry over up to 40 hours of unused sick leave to the next calendar year.
However the employer is only required to let their employee use up to 40 hours of sick leave per
calendar year.
The employer cannot retaliate against an employee for requesting or using their sick leave. If
employees have any complaints related to the Sick Leave Law they can be filed with the New
York City Department of Consumer Affairs. The website is nyc.gov/paid sick leave.
Questions and Answers
Montefiore Medical Center
Ms. Miosotis Munoz said that she was the new liaison for Montefiore Medical Center. I’ve
worked extensively as an advocate and also as a staffer to make sure that our residents in the
Bronx and throughout the city have the best quality service available and not only the best
healthcare system but also improving the quality of life.Pg. 3
What I would like to share with today in particular is that as your liaison I want to be that bridge.
We want to be able to work in partnership not only with the Community Board but with the
community leaders who are the eyes and ears to help us improve the new reform. A lot of people
do not understand that with the reform it’s about taking control of your life and making sure. It’s
about creating partnerships even with the other hospitals. We’re trying to improve our systems
but we need your help.
A lot of people that are undocumented immigrants are not qualified to apply for the Obama Care.
That does not mean that they don’t have access to healthcare there is still emergency Medicaid
and that’s going to go year around and we have to get the word out there. There is a
misconception going on and it’s important that people understand. If you’re not qualified to
apply for emergency Medicaid but you still want to see a Doctor we have federally qualified
clinics all throughout the Bronx which have specific standards set by the federal government.
Which means a person who goes in there with proof of income based on what they earn and what
they can afford to pay for that Doctor visit we have our federally qualified sliding scale clinics
and it’s very important that we get this information out there to the community. We really try to
get the word out there that it’s about prevention.
The next part on our list of new initiatives is about Montefiore opening up new clinics. We
understand that there is an issue with the emergency room primarily because a lot of people use
it. We have some of the best Doctor’s that has made Montifiore one of the top ten hospitals in
the nation. So no longer do residents have to go to other boroughs to get the best quality
healthcare. One of the things we want to do to reduce the waiting time in our emergency room is
our Urgent Care Centers that are open throughout the weekend from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM on
Saturdays and Sundays and during the week until 10:00 PM at night. Then we have our Family
Health Center which advocates for children with special needs.
Again please let me know if there is any way that I can provide you with assistance as your
liaison.

Chairman and District Manager’s Report
The District Manager said that tonight we have a Public Hearing on an item that has come before
the Economic Development-Land Use & Housing committee three times and approved related to
a ULURP Application that we received from the Department of Parks. I will read it into the

Five Borough Shops was created to meet the construction and repair needs of a growing Parks
Department. The employees are a range of skilled maintenance workers carpenters, blacksmiths,
machinists, plumbers, electricians and painters that make specialized repairs to parks and pools
citywide. The Shop maintains a storehouse for raw materials, equipment and supplies to
manufacture specialized parts that facilitate repairs. At this site there will be approximately 141
employees. There will be a certain amount of official vehicles that will be stored on site mostly
passenger vans bringing workers to the park sites to make repairs and we will have a number of
dump trucks.
The Environmental Assessment Statement was completed culminating in a negative declaration
which means that there is no environmental impact that will occur as a result of our use of thisPg. 5
site. We’ve worked closely with the New York City Department of Transportation and have a
plan for traffic and parking.
We are looking forward to implementing a green rooftop as part of the division and the building
provides the framework where that could happen.

I am pleased by how residents and visitors took the time to celebrate the beauty, culture, talent
and development of our neighborhoods. I am honored to once again be part of this very special
annual tradition, and can’t wait to see what’s in store for next year,” said Bronx Borough

sponsor of bill S4406.
 The State Senator celebrates the culture and heritage of his home borough while attending Bronx
Week 2014 events.

The representative for Assemblywoman Carmen E. Arroyo’s Ms. Neyda Franco said that I’ve
been knocking on doors and found that in a building of 120 there were only four people to
register to vote in that building. I have been to seven buildings and they all have more than 90
apartments and that is one of the biggest things that I’ve encountered. This is one of the things
that we need to look at because I had a lady living in an apartment for thirty-two years and there
are five people registered but there is no one there but her. So these are things that I’ve
encountered going out to get people to register to vote.
The representative for Councilwoman Maria Del Carmen Arroyo said that I don’t have anything
to report. We offer services to the community if there are constituents that have any needs they
are more that welcome to come to our office. We’re located at 384 East 149th Street on Third
Avenue.
Ms. Joann Otero Chief of Staff for Councilwoman Arroyo said that I come with good news if
you’re a registered voter on our website you will be able to see the resources that
Councilmember Arroyo was able to get for the district. We passed the budget yesterday and it
was an awesome experience for me it was the first time that there was a formula used so thatPg. 8
Councilmember’s were ranked on needs and Councilmember Arroyo ranked three so she was
able to bring in over $700,000 thousand dollars Discretionary Funding into the district.
I know we’ve lost a lot of this area and we’ve moved up to Crotona East Tremont area but we
still have some of this area. So as Stephanie says we’re still there Monday through Friday open
door policy.

Committee Reports
The Economic Development-Land Use & Housing Committee submitted a written report and provided a
brief overview on the following presentations.
 New York City Department of Parks and Recreation and the New York City Department of
Citywide Services ULURP Application for site selection and acquisition of property 850 East
138th Street, between Walnut and Willow East of the Bruckner for the purposes of relocating their
Five Borough Shop created to meet the construction and repair needs of the Parks Department.
The Vote on the New York City Parks and Recreation and New York City Department of
Citywide Administrative Services ULURP Application was taken and approved by the
Board Members at the Public Hearing with modifications.
 West Side Federation for Senior and Supportive Housing proposing to replicate Borinquen Court
with the development of another 169 units of senior housing while undertaking renovation to the
existing site.
 Mr. Cesar Yoc discussed his proposed idea called Millbrook Gardens for the redesigning of the
open spaces at the Millbrook Housing Development.
 Mr. Ted Weinstein from the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and
Development fully explained the 2014 New York City Area Medium Income (AMI) and
distributed an AMI chart.
The Chairperson said that there is a voting item that has come before the committee two or three times
and would give a brief synopsis about what the project is about where it’s located. The project is the
138th Street Apartments Project and is located on the site of the former gas station and Kentucky Fried
Chicken and that’s on the northeast corner of 138th Street and Third Avenue also considered part of the
Lower Concourse neighborhood.
The first time Lettire Construction Corp. came before our committee we did our due diligence and did not
like how the project was initially presented because what they wanted to do was to have supportivePg. 9
housing components in there and we felt that 138th Street was just over saturated. The developer was very
responsive to the committee and listened to our concerns to build permanent housing there without that
supportive housing component. Therefore it is the committee’s recommendation to the Board that they
fully support this project.
Mr. Manual Rivera and Mr. Matthew Gross from Lettire Construction Corp. answered questions related
to the project.
The Chairman called for a vote on the Lettire Construction Corp. 138th Street Apartments Project.
Motion made to support the Lettire Construction Corp. 138th Street Apartments Project located on the site

Public Session
Human Rights Commission
Ms. Belinda Simmons, Deputy Director in the Bronx office I’m here to just let people know
that we are active in the community. We enforce the Human Right Law which prohibits discrimination in
employment, housing and where you get your services.
What we’ve been doing in Community Board #1 is that we’ve been active in the back to work programs
over at FEG’s, SoBRO and Goodwill Industries where we go on a weekly basis. Also when there is a
bias case in this area we keep track of them to see if there is a pattern and if we find that there is we then
see what we can do to rectify the issue. We go into schools, civic centers and senior centers to talk about
bias harassment.
What we’ve did most recently is that there is going to be a new LGBT Center over here on Brook Avenue
opening in January. We’ve been meeting with the Mayor’s Office and BoomHealth. BoonHealth has a
LGBT Youth Preventive Center. So what we’re trying to do is work with them so when the center opens
up we want to be able to provide services to the youth that come in because they may not necessarily have
access to services outside of this community.
I have brought with me a lot of information regarding the discrimination issues that we work with.

QuestionsSouth Bronx Famers Market
Mr. Brent a representative from the Farmers Market said that we starting a Famers Market which will take
place on 138th Street, between Alexander and Willis Avenues. We have a couple of farmers that will be
selling their goods. We’re looking for more farmers and local people to sign up and participate. We will
be accepting EBT and SNAP. We’re also looking for volunteers I have form that I will leave here and
can be passed around for anyone who wants to sign up and be a part of this.
The market will be on Saturday’s starting on June 14th from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM up through the week
before Thanksgiving which will be the last one.
Questions
Arts & Labor
Ms. Emily Baierl said that I’m here as part of a group called Arts & Labor. To speak with you about
something we’re working on called the Frieze NY Art Fair. It’s held on Randall’s Island every May with
all the big galleries in New York. Big galleries internationally come there once a year. There are
millions of dollars in sales but yet the Fair pays back very little to the City of
New York. We are working on a proposal whereby fees would give a percentage back to the
communities of the South Bronx and East Harlem for the next year’s fair.

Chairman & District Manager’s Report
Deputy Inspector Lorenzo Johnson said that one thing that the Mayor, new Police Commissioner and Mr.
Loftin have discussed is the Vision Zero. With the Vision Zero is we’re doing selected enforcement for
Pg. 3
traffic violations that we believe cause fatalities and the first that the 40th precinct is experiencing is the
Grand Concourse. The Grand Concourse as of May 15th has dropped down from 30 miles per hour to 25
miles per hour. Because of that I have had my officers out there and we’ve issued over 200 speedingsummonses to people who were speeding and not only going over the 25 but also the former speed of 30
miles per hour. Another thing that we have noticed that causes a lot of accidents is cell phones. They’re
talking and texting on their cell phone while driving erratically and we’ve issued over 300 summonses.
Another infraction that we’ve kind of been enforcing a lot more is failure to yield to pedestrians.
Especially around this area people are crossing the street and the driver becomes annoyed and try’s to hit
them. We’ve issued over 100 summonses last month for failure to yield to pedestrians. Again this is one
of the things that the Mayor is kind of stressing because last year we had more fatalities due to motor
vehicles than homicides caused by firearms. So again we in the New York Police Department take
human life very serious. This is just one way we’re going about it.
Also last Monday started summer and that’s when people get a little rowdy. One thing that I’m going to
do is be more proactive in policing to allow everybody to enjoy the beautiful weather like we’re having
today.
I have two impact zones the west and east and have over fifty officers that are assigned from
8:00 PM at night to 4:00 AM in the morning. I also have two conditioned teams in the AM and PM and I
have plain clothes police officers that are patrolling the area twenty-four hours/seven days a week. Again
we’re going to be proactive so we get some of these criminals before they do something serious of
robberies and shootings. So that everybody in this precinct can enjoy this beautiful area.
Another thing that you’ve been hearing a lot about is heroin. A couple of years ago people we’re addicted
to prescription pills. With that being harder to get heroin use is kind of on the upswing. In the 40th
Precinct one thing the Police Commissioner and Attorney General Schneiderman have kind of done all of
the police officers are going to be equipped with noxolin an anti-opium antagonist so that if somebody
od’s you give them that needle and it can counter effect the overdose and hopefully save as many lives as
we possibly can.
Two months ago in the Moore Houses the Bronx Gang Unit has taken down twenty-five additional
perpetrators for conspiracy and they all went federal looking at a minimum of ten
years. That’s just the beginning one thing that I’ve done since I’ve gotten here over a month ago is that I
sat down with the Bronx Narcotics, Bronx Gang, Housing, Transit discussing more ways to keep the
people in Community Board #1 in the 40th Precinct safer.

Emergency Rights
Pg. 4
Ms. Awilda Cordero founder said that this is a 501C non-profit organization but we also have Attorney’s
doing work for us whenever we need them. Coming back and opening up my organization I’m here to letyou know that someone like me is out there. What I’m doing is crime victim, and domestic violence and
trying to stay away from the homeless right now because we don’t have the space. We’re concentrating
also on rape victims we’ve had a lot of woman that have come to us that have been raped and don’t know
who to go to and scared to go to the Police because they don’t know what’s going to happen next. I
actually take them by hand and help them through the necessary steps. Also I’m working with child
abuse of children that have been beaten up and killed by loved ones so we’re working with these families.
Working on crime victim cases of people that get killed in the street and their families don’t know where
to go so they come to my office. We’re also opening the door to immigrants who are here and may get
hurt and don’t know where to go. Sometimes they get hurt at work they stay quiet because they’re scared
to go to the Police and make a report or to Worker’s Compensation because they think that they’re going
to be deported and taken out of here. I’m also helping out with Alzheimer’s. So anyone that has any love
ones that need help you can always come to my office we know what to do with them.
Questions
Silent Cry, Inc.
Ms. Shawanna E. Vaughn, President said I run a non-profit and work with kids from ages 6-16. I deal
with gun violence. I’m going to be running a summer program that deals with math, literacy and different

Questions
The representative for Assemblywoman Carmen E. Arroyo, Ms. Neyda Franco said that as far as up to
date registrations it’s going slowly and now we’re reaching out to the schools trying to work with the
Parent Coordinators to get materials out to the parents. It seems that a lot of the parents in the community
are not getting the information. I don’t know how but there has to be some way that we can reach more
of these parents so that they’re able to come in and be part of these community boards and the community
watch because more buildings are going up and we’re going to have to get more united communities. As
far as the elections like I said the petitions are coming up soon but we are going to continue to register.
So if you know someone that wants to register they can always go the Assemblywoman’s office
everybody that’s there can register. Or me at the office and let me know if there is a senior citizen that
can’t come out of their home and I will go over and register them.
The representative from the New York City Comptroller’s office Mr. Jason Laidly said that
he deals with the city pensions. We also work with all the city contracts so we’re not the ones that have
the contracts we just register them. Also we do audits of all the city agencies. We also have a department
called CAC which is like our 311 where we deal with any issues that come up. The Comptroller does an
Arts Report and realized that both the Bronx and Brooklyn are
underserved when it comes to having an Art Teacher and because he did that we’re now working with
DOE to see if we can get more Art Programs into our communities. Finally any claims that you have
with the city comes through our office so if you get injured and trying to figure out how to get through
that it comes to our office.

Public Session
Love Gospel Assembly Church
Minister Danny Diaz said that I don’t know if everyone knows that we do have a low wage
worker movement in this nation. You’ve heard of a lot of different fronts the Living Wage
Campaign that happened here in New York City, the State Minimum Wage, the Federal
Minimum Wage Campaign, Fast Food Worker Campaign, and the Airport Security Guard
Campaigns. These are all campaigns that speaking towards peoples wages and hopefully lifting
up that floor. We remember years ago that the Banks were bailed out, corporations were bailed
Pg. 2out so we’re fighting for people to get bailed out. We’re fighting for our communities for better
jobs and better wages.
Those campaigns a new front that came up is called the Carwash Campaign. There’s two
hundred carwashes in New York City it’s an industry that historically has never been regulated
and when there’s no regulation and no standards there’s a lot of exploitation. What we found out
that thousands of workers have had their wages robbed there’s been no overtime. To scrape the
bottom of these carwashers and what comes out of that is a toxic sludge that’s built off of
degreasers and solvents that build up over time and when they do that they’re suppose to get rid
of this in an environmentally clean manner and that cost money because they have to have
professionals come in and do it. That doesn’t happen what happens that these guys get into these
pits they scrape it out and without you or me knowing it they go and dump it right in the corner
sewer which is effecting our water system. We don’t know what studies will show in the future
of how that’s affected us in our water but nevertheless this is something that’s going on in our
backyard.
This is why I’m here because Sunny Day was all over the newspapers it was a carwash where the
owner decided not to pay his workers. Because why they tried to organize and join a union and
we know that’s something being dismantled in our nation. We know that so many unions so
many of our family and friends have talked about it we’ve seen it all over the newspaper. We are
trying to help these men become part of a union and that’s what the Retail Wholesale
Department Store Union is doing that’s what New York City Communities for Change, that’s
what Make the Road New York and faith leaders. All these people I just mentioned are a
coalition of people that believe this industry should be regulated. Melissa Mark-Viverito who is
our first Latina Speaker she is writing a legislation for the carwasheros. She’s helping to put
together a legislation that will protect the community from this illegal dumping and it will also
protect immigrant workers. These owners are supposed to provide ample supplies of protective
gear OSHA standards. Some people here know what OSHA is these are federal standard
guidelines for health and protection for workers. They don’t give them goggles or gloves they
don’t give them aprons. So we’ve seen a lot of these men come down with skin infections, eye
infections, lung infections and so that’s what this law is going to do it’s going to set standards.
Every carwash is going to have to have a license at some point that’s what the law talks about
and just like a Laundromat has to do that and have a set of regulations that they have to abide by.
So in doing this we will be able to make sure that workers are treated right that workers are paid
on time that their schedules are just that they’re paid overtime that their given a lunch hour.
Imagine having to work without a lunch hour five minutes to maybe go to the bathroom. So it’s
exploitive we’ve seen people have to work 80 hours even 110 hours a week and even then if
there’s a scratch on the person’s car you would think the management would take care of it they
don’t do that they go into their tip money and take it out of their tip money. So the machine
scratches the car but the immigrant worker has to pay for that so these things were happening in
our backyard.
Pg. 3We went to Sunny Day and we told them you know what you’re breaking the law. It’s illegal to
do what you’re doing you’re not supposed to fire everyone especially because they want to
organize. It they’re organizing for to join a union it’s illegal to fire them. So we want and the
workers want not only that the get their jobs back but they got a union contract. So it’s one of
the 7 unionized car washers in the city so history is being made as we speak it is a national
movement. So this carwash movement is happening nationally and this is what’s happening in
New York out of the 200, 7 have contracts. It would be awesome to have the constituency of
this district support the car washers that are unionized sending a message to the industry that you
have to treat your workers right. That you should treat them with dignity and respect not hold
the deportation issue over their heads, nobody wants to go to work having to fear being
intimidated and being disrespected. So that’s just a huge part of this too which is to kind of fight
for people’s dignity. That’s why the community of faith is really a part of this because we
believe that this is found in all our different religions from Christianity to Islam to Judaism the
threat of justice is always there God is always trying to reach out and represent those that have
no voice. So that’s why we’re doing this and that’s why I’m a part of it and I just want to let the
Community Board know what’s going on in your community and we’re moving forward.
Tomorrow I’m going to be at a carwash in Queens that’s on strike same situation the owner
doesn’t want to pay the guys. So he said he’s going to negotiate possibly this Friday but we’re
going to have a big rally tomorrow with the press hopefully our Speaker will be there with us and
we’re just going to be uplifting this issue again and like I said we’re at 7, 193 to go. My email is
DannyDiazlifecause@gmail.com if you have any questions or concerns.
Questions
South Bronx Community Congress
Mr. Ed Figueroa said that I’m here tonight as a member of the community with a concern that we
think should be brought to Planning Board #1 and we hope that you guys can take it beyond
these rooms which is the elevator at 149th Street and Grand Concourse subway stop. I don’t
know if any of you might have been around over 40-years ago when we had the Third Avenue El
and it was eliminated. One of the stops in the Bronx was the Hub in Mott Haven along 149th
Street and Grand Concourse. It’s been over 40-years that it has not been used and 2-years ago a
friend of ours happening to be running for the State Assembly and you know when you’re a
candidate people tell you what their concerns are and one of the concerns was from a senior
citizen about the elevator
We are a volunteer organization we do this out of the goodness and needs of the community.
That’s why I’m very happy that Brother Rodriguez and you guys allowed us a few minutes to
bring this to your attention.
Pg. 4A lot of people use that train station over the years they’ve seen it when that station was actually
active. We need that service we are taxpayers and there are state funds that pertain to that type
of occasion. If Yankee Stadium can get theirs in less than 6 to 7 months then why can’t we.
We’re actually the taxpayers. The brother that just spoke was just talking about being bailed out
by big corporations but we small class folks the working class folks we need our bailouts too. So
we have to raise our voices and you know there was a vacuum and that’s why we’re out here and
its best that we do this instead of letting other authorities do it because it is better when the
community has a stake in the services and the authorities tend to pay more attention. The
authorities said that they did a service where there was a leak at the station and they did a capital
improvement. Now if you go to the train station you see that it is still leaking so it was a
cosmetic job. We need them to go in there and break the stuff apart fix it and with the excess
money fix the elevator shaft. So that’s why we need to continue this petition drive.
We have reached out the Elected Officials in the community we have commitments from two to
sit down and speak with us. We do plan another activity in the month of March but we need the
communities support to stand behind this issue. We want it to really come to fruition we need
the members of the community to come out and have their stake heard as well. So with that we
hope you follow us on Face Book and look for us in the media because we will be once again in
March meeting with the students at Hostos Community College and we hope to see some of your
faces there as well.

Chairman & District Manager’s Report
The District Manager introduced the New York City Department of Transportation Bronx
Borough Commissioner Constance Moran.
The Bronx Borough Commissioner for the New York City Department of Transportation said
that Assistant Commissioner Wendy Feuer will be making a presentation this evening on a very
important DOT project called Pedestrian Wayfinding. This is a project that’s ongoing citywide
the first section of the Bronx that we’re treating it in is Mott Haven and the Concourse area.
Assistant Commissioner Feuer said that we’re trying to get people to walk more. How do you
get people to walk more one way is to make sure that they have information about where they’re
going.
When we began this whole project of designing it we did research and what we found was that
about 20 percent of the people walking around New York City still get lost and people who live
here who admitted to getting lost 9 percent. So you can imagine in places where you’re not
familiar when you get out of the subway station if there was a map there that said this is where
you’re going and this is how to get there. So what is Wayfinding it helps you find your way. It
helps you orient yourself to where you’re going. Our model was London they have these all over
the city. So we hired a team that came together with graphic design, Wayfinding experience in
London, industrial design and they started doing focus groups, meetings, workshops and we were
lucky to have five different neighborhoods work with us on the prototype. We were really lucky
because it represented midtown with the grid, Chinatown which a lot of small streets, Brooklyn
with the cultural, and Long Island City that is both industrial and sort of up and coming more
residential and a lot of hotels so we were able to have different types.
One of the things they did with it that we thought was very smart was that everybody knows the
subway the white on black they know those signs and they use something called Helvetica
Pg. 6typeface. So they said let’s use Helvetica typeface everybody knows it and lets use a white on
black type and we have now DOT Helvetica which has a round dot instead of a square dot.
There’s a whole system and this is a Wayfinding system and what do I mean by system. So you
have your pedestrian Wayfinding is something that never happened in the city before where
there’s a consistent map all over the city and all transportation types. The area sign is close to
intersections where possible and where there are wide sidewalks. Path sign reinforces the
direction on predictable grid on congested or narrow sidewalks and is good for mid-block
locations. Neighborhood signs are for plazas and open spaces. Then we have the fingerpost and
you don’t need a map it’s just a reassurance. The select bus service sign has a bus map on one
side and a pedestrian map on the other side and we have real time bus information. So we’re
working with working with New York City Transit on real time bus information which will say
next bus is coming you know three stops away, two stops away.
We have a meeting next week with the Tourism Bureau on the Ancillary map. So on the hand
held maps a Business Improvement District a borough can make their own maps but again looks
like the maps that we’re putting on the street so they’re all connected. So we’ve worked with
New York & Company., Long Island City, 34th Street and the borough of the Bronx.
So these are the components they tried to make it very simple. It’ in the ground we have a
footing so it’s stable and it’s hard to knock over it has a bottom portion and the largest portion is
glass where the map is. The interesting thing is that map is vinyl so you can take the glass off
and replace it with a new glass piece and then they can take the vinyl off and put new vinyl on.
So it’s a way of not having to redo the entire thing so you can take it off and on.
The information on it tells you exactly where you are like the bus stop. Tells you the area that
you’re in, it tells you how to get to the nearest subway station, it tells what’s to the east or west
and then we have these things called Path Map Pointers that says it’s a five-minute walk here.
One of the important things about this is that it doesn’t say that it’s a half-a-mile away it says it’s
a five-minute walk away or a ten-minute walk away. Then we have the focus map on top and the
bottom is the overview map.
People have said what about different languages you know New York has what 150 languages
spoken so what we did was make it a map based system so that you don’t need different
languages. So the icons are universal so people understand that it’s all very visual with the
names of the streets and neighborhood. So the focus map gives you the street names, building
numbers, subway entrances there’s a lot of information packed on here and what we thing is a
really good way that it’s not overwhelming. The overview map gives you a wider berth and it
says okay this is the context where you are and then in the focus map this is the place you are
and it says ten or fifteen minute walk.
Pg. 7The next steps are to finalize location plan, review locations with Landmarks Preservation
Commission and Parks, finalize sub-surface review, install new foundations in the spring of 2014
and install signs in the summer of 2014.
Our first installed areas in 2013 were in the Garment District, Long Island City, Chinatown,
Prospect Heights and Crown Heights. The planned areas in 2014 are South Bronx/Concourse,
Lower Manhattan and Grand Central Terminal area so hopefully these will start going up in
June.
Questions
Police Officer Hector Espada from the 40th Police Precinct said that there will be a Domestic
Violence Forum at Jackson Avenue Family Residence 691 East 138th Street, between Cypress &
Jackson Avenues on March 5, 2014 from 6 to 8 PM. Once again we’re putting a lot of efforts
into this forum and it going to help especially our community when it comes to domestic
violence incidents. Please make sure that if you have someone that is not a US citizen bring
them we have are not required to inquire if they are a US citizen that’s not our problem. We
don’t care whether they are born in the United States or not. A lot of people feel because they
are not a US citizen that they can’t make a report or they’re scared that they are going to get
deported it doesn’t work that way. We’re not here to find out where you’re from we’re here to
find out what’s wrong what’s going on are you a victim of domestic violence. So it’s very
important. If a man is getting abused it works the same way let’s not forget that because there’s
a lot of men out there that are physically and mentally abused. So please just spread the word.
Deputy Inspector Mccormack is putting a lot of effort into this forum because it’s a big problem
in this area.
Questions
Elected Officials Reports
The State Senator Jose M. Serrano’s representative submitted his Reports to the People.
Mr. Angel Santana said that the State Senator had sponsored an important “know Your Rights” Housing
Court Community Forum in the Bronx last month at the New Settlement Campus. It was created to show

Questions
Ms. Neyda Franco representative of Assemblywoman Carmen Arroyo said that last month the
Assemblywoman came in and spoke about voting and the money not coming into our districts
because of the lack of voting. We don’t have enough people coming out to vote so she started
an initiative where we’re going out I have been to Mitchell, Patterson, Board 1, Board 4, Board 2
to the Precinct Council and I’m also working with the schools trying to get people to register to
vote. So on the 25th I’ll be at Mitchell’s and I’ll be registering we’re going to send out flyers to
everybody in the community in that building. While they’re meeting I will be able to register,
change addresses or answer any questions. At the Patterson I will be doing it on March 31st. So
I will be going around all the different organizations and working with the schools and at the
same time anything that they need that I could help them or the Assemblywoman.
My background is education I’ve been in the community a long time. Housing I’ve gone to court
with tenants. So anything that they don’t have to go further than their door if they have any
questions I able to answer. Understanding that if we don’t register we don’t vote and we can’t
get the money into our community. There are a lot of things going on in our community.

Bronx.

will serve community residents here in the Bronx right in the area of Mott Haven.
Our Participatory Budget initiative is moving along smoothly we’re getting dozens of project
ideas including a lot in the Bronx there are small scale capital projects in Patterson, Betances,
Millbrook and Mott Haven. In Mott Haven they’re proposing a bundle for nine schools for to
have computer labs throughout the South Bronx schools, Highbridge and Mott Haven so that’s

Public Session
The District Manager introduced Assemblywoman Carmen E. Arroyo.
Assemblywoman Arroyo said thank you for your attention Happy New Year to everybody.
Happy everything well except the weather it’s cold but I think at this time last year it was not this
cold. But it is a new year and we have work to do.
I’m here today and you will see me now more often because we have a big problem in our
community specifically in the district that I represent in Albany. The voting in this community
has gone down about 30 percent and that is a disaster. Having elections years ago that we have
8,000 people coming out to vote down to 3,000 is a shame. How this works is very crucial for us
because in this community I represent they count us by the people that vote and we have a
district that 28 and 32 thousand people vote. Even though each district has the same population
120 thousand individuals and from those 32 thousand to 3,000 in the South Bronx that puts my
face down. Then I spoke with my Speaker and we agreed in something that is important that we
come out to the community and make a campaign to register people because other communities
don’t have the problems that we face. One of the problems that we face is the mobility of people
Pg. 2
from one side to another. If you look the district has about 12 shelters people and shelters are not
permanent residents that affects all of us. Another part is s big population from the community ismoving away because our schools are failing and people of course look for a better environment
for the children I don’t blame them. The schools were not good when I had my children I never
moved but I went inside and fought for their education. You know that I was a School Board
member for years and I helped the schools and helped the parents to improve the ability of our
children and the capacity to learn. Now we have Charter Schools and what is happening is that
the Charters are becoming better schools than the Public Schools. This year we have 68 percent
more applications for Charter Schools for children than was last year. People believe in Charter
Schools for two reasons Charter School is a community school you have the opportunity to meet
the Teacher you have a direct contact but more than that the money is controlled by the school.
It’s not like we send billions of dollars to the city for education and from those billions only
pennies go into the classroom. There are Public Schools where the Teacher has to use money
from her salary to buy things for the classroom is that a shame. The past Administration for 10
years is water under the bridge let’s see how working together we can help to change this
because you know who’s the one affected our children.
Developing in my office a registration drive. Nada Franco now works with me. You know Nada
from the community and she is well known in this community. We are going to be visiting
buildings speaking to people and putting flyers in the buildings under the doors to make sure that
those that are not registered come out and get registered. New citizens please advise them that
the first thing that they must do is get registered to vote. Let’s work together in our community I
need help everywhere that I go I scream and fight for my community as I do every day and I
have been doing that for 20 years. This is my 20th year in the Assembly and you didn’t send me
to Albany to decorate the walls because the walls of the Capitol doesn’t need decoration you
send me over there to work and that’s what I am doing.
Let me tell you a big victory that I had this year for many years we have been fighting with the
Board of Regents and the State Department of Education because bi-lingual education has been
put aside for years. I’m the Chair of bi-lingual education in the Assembly and day by day
involved in education across the State because it’s not only the South Bronx who has children
that need bi-lingual education. You’d be surprised how many children need bi-lingual education
and how the government takes the money and puts the money down the drain except in the
classrooms for the children. After so many years of fighting we have a big victory you have to
know this because you send me there to fight for you. The Board of Regents made a position of
Assistant Commissioner of Education. For the first time in the history of the State Department
of Education we have a Hispanic woman sub-Commissioner in charge of Bi-Lingual Education
Angelica Infante from New York. A friend of mine such a woman is a professional she got a
Doctorate degree. She sits in the cabinet of the Commission she is one of the head there making
decisions for us. For me that is the biggest victory that I ever had in the State Assembly even
though we have achieved a lot because I was the creator of Charters. When nobody believed in
Charters I think together with a group of people and we put Charter on the table and Charter is
Pg. 3
working. What works the fact there is money that is what I am concerned about Bi-Lingual
Education receives federal funding in the billions that money never goes to the classrooms. Butnow we have a watchdog in the Department of Education that is going to be working for us and
with us. In general education the Governor is putting money where the money belongs and we
are telling him where he makes mistakes. He happens to be a good friend I call him el muchacho
because I know him when he was a muchacho and he’s doing very good. This year he passed a
ten point bill for the rights of woman to receive in pay the same money for the same work as men
that never happened before. Those are issues that we have to work with.
The minimum wage we are all listening to what is going on. Now the President brought it to the
table and also gave the order the Federal Contractors to pay $10.10 an hour to employees that
were making $7.00 an hour. In our community because I receive complaints there are a lot of
small businesses that are concerned and the concern is how I can pay that. These are programs
that we have to work with. As a community representative I represent everybody not just the
workers but also the small businesses. What we are trying to do is give them a tax incentive for
each extra penny that they pay in salary that they receive a tax break from the federal
government and the state government. Then we can match the situation and everybody will be
happy because if a person is making a couple of dollars more a day they’re not going to go to
Washington to spend the money they are going to spend the money in the neighborhood and that
is important.
Questions
Police Officer Hector Espada said that the Deputy Inspector was working on a Domestic
Violence Forum for the 40th coming up in March. We have the place but we’re trying to figure
out the date and time. We would like for as many people in the community to participate in this
forum because a lot of people are not educated as far as domestic violence especially if you have
friends and neighbors that are from country that are scared to report domestic violence because
of deportation. That’s not true no one is going to get deported we don’t look for that we don’t
ask for that we treat everyone the same if you’re a victim you’re a victim that’s what we look at,
at the end of the day to make your life less dangerous. So please tell those people that weren’t
born in the United States that are not educated with knowing the law we’re not here to question
where you’re from. So please spread the word. The forum will be held on March 5th 6 to 8 PM.

Chairman & District Manager’s Report
The Chairman and District Manager gave their report on the following items.
 The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation has added 735 Melrose
Avenue (Bronx) the former Melrose Avenue Dry Cleaner to its Registry of Inactive
Hazardous Waste Disposal Sites within New York’s State Superfund Program. This state
program identifies, investigates and cleans up sites where large accumulations of
hazardous waste may exist.
 The development of Bronxchester sites 6 and 7 is to be developed by a project called La
Central proposing to build five apartment buildings with a total of 985 units on the last
large parcel of city-owned vacant land. This project will include a YMCA, a rooftop
farm, a recording studio, stores, restaurant, a clinic and parking garage.
The District Manager asked Paul Philps from City Planning to provide a brief overview
on the proposed project.
Mr. Paul Philps said that these are the Bronxchester sites which I think everyone is
familiar with sites 6 and 7. The development team HPD did an RFP they selected a team
and the previous Mayor made an announcement in December. The team came and gave a
brief presentation to the committee in January. They will have to go through ULURP
because it’s city-owned property. They will be working with our department and HPD
on the proposal so that’s to say that they will come back to you guys several more times.
Some of the Board Members have identified questions and concerns about some aspects
of the development. They’ve taken all those into account they will work with HPD and
Cedric and come back to you guys. When it does enter public review it will be a full
ULURP item so we will go through the usual process it will come to Community Board,
the Borough President, City Planning Commission and the City Council as well.
Questions
 Fresh Direct had informed the Board that they have begun test borings on the site at the
Harlem River Yards. Will keep the Board informed of any future developments.

Public Session
Good evening everyone my name is Minerva Medina and I work for State Senator Ruben Diaz. I
wanted to inform you of an activity that did take place this week it was on Monday and we gave
out toys to the children at IS216. It was very successful and we gave away about one thousand
Pg. 2toys. Tomorrow starting at seven at Maestro’s we will be having a Christmas Party. I did give
out invitations. This celebration for Christmas is for free it’s an open bar and free food. It’s for
the community we’re inviting a lot of people so what I would advise is that if you are deciding to
go tomorrow please try to be there before seven because although it’s an open invitation seating
is limited.
I also wanted to inform that although I do not have any invitations at this time there will be an
activity on January the 3rd for the Three Kings Day where we’re going to be giving out toys as
well.
If you’d like to ask me any questions on any topic the number to the office is 718-991-3161 and
the address to the office is 900 Rogers Place and that’s on 163rd next to Intervale Avenue. So
I’m hoping to being part of this Community Board become informed about this area and be able
to relate any information needed to the Senator.
Mr. Angel Santana said that he’s from Senator Serrano’s Office and I would like to talk about a
few items on the report.
Senator Serrano paid a visit to PS 385 and spoke with the students about his work as a State
Senator with classes in the third, fourth and fifth grades. The visit served as an opportunity for
the students to ask questions and learn about their local, state and federal government. The
Senator said that it was truly inspiring to spend the morning speaking with the students at PS
385.
Another item I wanted to speak about was a decision by Landmarks Preservation Commission
which granted landmark status to the interior of the Bronx General Post Office. Serrano stated
that I am pleased that the Landmarks Preservation Commission has acknowledged the concerns
of the community advocates by protecting the historical and architectural integrity of the Bronx
Post Office interior. Since the 1930’s beautiful murals inside the General Post Office have been a
part of the diverse, artistic and cultural fabric of the South Bronx. It is indicative of the era now
long gone with our artisans working side by side with builders and architects to create structures
that are esthetically pleasing and inspiring while being extremely functional. I’m also pleased
that this functioning work of art will be preserved for generations to enjoy.
Lastly Senator Serrano believes that it is important to protect ourselves from the flu virus so
recently we held a free flu-shot event in our district office. This was co-sponsored by the
Visiting Nurse Service of New York and we were able to administer 40 shots.
Questions
Pg.3Mr. Andrew King representative from Councilwoman Melissa Mark Viverito said that it’s pretty
brief we had our first round of delegate committee meetings. Residents signed up in the fall with
our neighborhood assemblies to volunteer and work residents from Mott Haven and Highbridge
formed two solid committees and they’re just going to be developing the project proposals that
came out of those neighborhood assemblies. These small scale capital projects get such things as
50 new computers into a school lab or to upgrade a playground. So this first round of meetings
went well we got a space in Hostos right in the middle of the Bronx portion of our district.
My colleague had a meeting with NYCHA officials around the Betances Senior Center. I don’t
have too many details on that but I could follow up. And then we had a good meeting with a
Dean of High Schools because a lot of our schools not only lack quality physical education but
also sports. So some folks here in the South Bronx started a small school athletic league and
they’re trying to get about 1,000 students involved because their needs are not being met by the
Department of Education (DOE) within the regular public schools.
Questions
Ms. Emma Rodgers from Bronx Health Reach a part of the institute for Family Health a series of
federally qualified Health Centers and we do a variety of things but what I focus on is
community based health programs. I’m here tonight because I’m working with WEDCO which
is the Women’s Housing & Economic Development Corporation to do a needs assessment
survey of the community of Melrose. So we over the last year have been meeting with different
organizations, community boards and community members to talk about what are the needs of
the neighborhood. What’s working, what’s not working and how can we improve it overall. In
this area WEDCO is building a pretty large new site which is going to have affordable housing
as well as a space for a commercial site possibly for a supermarket as well as an area for
musicians. But right now again we’re doing some planning as to what are the needs and interests
how can we support community members in making some changes in making the neighborhood
of Melrose healthier, happier and a brighter area. So again after some meetings this summer we
are doing surveys of community members and organizations including SoBRO as well down the
road. I’m here today to see if you guys will fill out the survey number one and number two if
you could help with distribution. We’re trying to get about a thousand people to complete the
survey we are now approximately about three hundred. We have the survey in print we can drop
it off anywhere to any organization or housing development to people who live or go to school in
Melrose and also we have it online in English and Spanish. We want to hear from everyone and
the idea is once we collect all this information we’re going to report back to the community. So
you will probably see me again about in February and I will let you know what we’ve found and
then we’re going to form sort of a leadership team with community members and organizations
to prioritize three to five projects in Melrose. Looking at health and wellness in housing and
Pg. 4other areas we hope to do some good work in the community over next several years but it has to
come from you guys first that’s the most important thing.

Ms. Christine Blanch said that I don’t know how many of you have knowledge that we have
passed legislation that the smoking age be increased to twenty-one. We do understand that our
children are still sold cigarettes. That it is illegal for vendors to sell cigarettes to minors and
must follow the Merchants Code. We work in terms of creating smoke-free initiatives. There
are certain rules applied but are not being enforced. We would like to create a smoke-free BronxPg. 2
because we have high levels of asthma and bronchitis. It’s really about keeping our community
healthy.
The Chairman called for the roll.
The roll was called and there were twenty-four members present constituting a quorum.
New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission
Ms. Emily Genser of the Urban Fellow, Policy and External Affairs Department said that a state
law was passed this past June 6, 2013 that authorizes DOT to issues 18,000 street hail permits
and 20 % of those permits must be restricted to wheelchair-accessible vehicles.
Out of the 18,000 permits we have three issuance periods the first year 6,000 next year 6,000 and
the following year 6,000. As of November 8th we have sold all 6,000 permits for the first
issuance period. Out of that 6,000 20% have to be for wheelchair-accessible vehicles. We have
sold 1,200 permits restricted for wheelchair-accessible vehicles. Currently there are 1,208
vehicles which we call “hack-up” and what we mean is that they are on the street they are
allowed to pick-up passengers and their vehicle markings. So there are over 1,000 that are
allowed to pick-up.
Some of the basics of the program is that drivers and vehicle owners who purchase this permit
will be allowed to pick-up street hails in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens (except the airports),
Staten Island, and northern Manhattan (north of West 110th Street and East 96th Street). They
can also continue to provide pre-arranged service and respond to dispatch call from an affiliated
car service. Boro Taxis cannot provide pre-arranged cannot provide pre-arranged service or
respond to dispatch calls below West 110th Street or East 96th Street in Manhattan unless they are
providing Access-A-Ride service.
All Boro Taxis are required to have certain markings and equipment:
 All must be painted Apple Green
 All must have a credit card reader, a taximeter, a GPS unit and a roof light
 All Boro Taxis are inspected twice a year
The benefits of Boro Taxis are set fares meaning that all street hail pick-ups must use the
metered fare that is also used in yellow taxis. It is easy to distinguish Boro Taxis because they
are Apple Green. GPS locators make it easier to recover lost property and credit cards allow
passengers to pay by debit or credit card. That 20% of all Boro Taxis must be wheelchair-
accessible.Pg. 3
So far in Community Board #1 there are three Boro Taxis endorsed bases which are American
Base No. 1 Inc., New Superior Radio GRP Corp., and Metro Luxury Inc.

End of Public Session
Chairman & District Managers Report
The District Manager introduced the City Agencies present that were going to discuss the status
of PS 31.
Mr. Ted Weinstein, Director of Bronx Planning for HPD said that this has been an issue for
awhile and I’m going to start off and just give you some of the background that brought us to the
point where we’re here tonight.Pg. 4
Everything that’s gone on this year has been very much interagency effort between the Deputy
Mayor’s Office, DCAS, Buildings and HPD. There have been many, many discussions,
meetings and calls to try to figure out what’s the best thing to do in this situation. So the
background you people basically know it was a school building that was built in the end of the
nineteenth century it is one of several that was built by C.B.J Synder. C.B.J Synder was very
well known for the buildings that he built. I believe that there are three other school buildings in
the Bronx that he designed and are still in use. The building lasted a long time up to now. It was
designated a City Landmark by the Landmarks Commission in the 1980’s and then unfortunately
it started deteriorating like anything else things do get old. Showed a picture of how the school
looked when it had become a landmark.
Eventually in the 1990’s it started to deteriorate significantly and it got to the point where the
feeling was that it just wasn’t a safe building any longer to have children in and have people
going in and out of every day. So finally the decision was made that it had to he closed down
and vacated. I think most of you know this but just to be clear the former PS 31 that
organization was moved to another location. So there is still in the Bronx a PS 31 that operates
someplace else. The building was officially vacated in 1997 there were attempts made to try to
stabilize it not very successful at the time.
About the middle of the last decade 2004, 2005, 2006 at that time there was an effort to try to see
what to do about the building EDC actually took the lead at that point the city’s Economic
Development Corporation and there was again a lot of inter-agency discussion about what might
be done whether it could be reopened. The SCA, School Construction Authority felt that the
amount of money that it would have taken to renovate it just wasn’t worth it the amount of
money they could use that to actually build a new building someplace so they gave up
jurisdiction. All city properties with exceptions general city-owned properties are under the
jurisdiction of DCAS, city Department of Citywide Administrative Services. One of the
exceptions would be if it is residential property its HPD’s obviously school buildings it could be
SCA or the Department of Education. But they gave it up and it went to DCAS. But there was
this time in the middle of the last decade where attempts were made and there were discussions
at that time about RFP’s but it just didn’t seem like it was working out it seemed like it would be
too expensive at that time and so the efforts at that point just came to a halt. One of the things
and this became somewhat relevant to what took place this year is the organization Artspace had
expressed some interest. We actually took them there to look at it because this is what they do. I
know that you haven’t had a chance really to meet with them but they are based in Minneapolis
and basically what they do is they take old buildings particularly school buildings and they
renovate them into residential housing preferentially for Artists. Right now they’re working in a
building in Manhattan PS 109 to be exactly that. So they had expressed interest in this building
several years back that’s why they came again this year to be involved because they had beenPg. 5
here before. So again the efforts came to a halt and nothing really happened until this year.
Two things really prompted the greater focus this year one was the hurricane which more
severely damaged it and the other was that early this year there was some interest shown by
some entities to see if it could be renovated. So given those two things the increase focus by the
city on the building because of the increased damage and then the interest shown that’s what
made the city agencies start talking once more again about where do we go we really need to
make a decision.
Mr. Timothy Lynch, Assistant Commissioner for New York City Department of Buildings said
that I’m a licensed structural engineer and I spend most of my time working with department
responding to emergency conditions, public safety issues, unsafe buildings, collapses and
structurally unstable buildings.
The former PS 31 has been on our portfolio in my unit for the last five years. The actual
building itself has had decades of problems with it. It didn’t arrive just fifteen years ago when
this campaign to repair it was undertaken. The actual repairs for former PS 31 date back
decades. It is an elegant looking building but in reality it was a hybrid type building it was very
early for the type of construction that it was. It looks classical but it was this hybrid structure
between steel, cast iron, terracotta all kinds of stuff that was just coming into use at the time new
types of schools. It looked monumental but the reality of it was that it really wasn’t put together
that well and there was distress in the structure at a very early age. Which is fine that can be
tackled and indeed fifteen years ago, sixteen years ago this School Construction Authority
undertook and enormous structural repair campaign. The building was in very bad shape and the
structural repair campaign got away from the General Contractor and the building became unsafe
fifteen years ago.
The amount of degradation brought us to a point where the General Contractor was unable
stabilize the building. The school building was vacated all the students had to be relocated and
the building was shored up with wood. So the entire south side which you can see is completely
opened to the elements. It’s been open to the elements for a decade and a half. The actual inside
structure the structure that’s holding up the building is in very poor shape it was never really a
robust building to start with. It’s structurally unstable and it’s been structurally unstable for
fifteen years.
Every two or three seasons the Building Department working with owner has to go in and do a
stabilization as elements of the building fall to the street. There has been a shed an unsightly
timber shed around this building for fifteen years everybody should be familiar with that. PiecesPg. 6
of the facade pieces of the building do drop unto the building unto the sidewalk shed. We have
been servicing this for thousand linear feet of shed outside that building for fifteen years. Pieces
of the facade have been dropping and endangering the public which we have been addressing on
an as needed basis on behalf of the owner.
It became quite bad in hurricane Sandy when the unstable building started to shed material on the
south side into the playground. The elements of the building started to drop into the playground.
The building is in a very bad state of deterioration we’ve been campaigning to get in the
basement fills up with water there has been all types you know of nuisance abatement. It’s not
habitable it’s really unsafe to walk around as well. I’ve done many tours of this building with
folks from the Bronx, interested groups and engineers but that’s the way we have it right now.
It’s really unstable it’s been unstable for quite some time. As a public safety issue it is not
acceptable to the Building Department for our engineers to have this huge piece of real estate
that is an endangerment to the public up in the Bronx and we’ve decided working with many
groups to campaign it to not campaign it to do this and do that it’s been unstable every time
we’ve looked at it unlike a wine it doesn’t get better with age this thing is just continuing to
degrade. We’ve issued an Emergency Dec. to take it down an Emergency Declaration to take it
down now and bring resolution to this unsafe structure. It’s been bad for many years and in
reality it should have been tackled a lot earlier than it has been now. But that’s where we are
we’ve issued an Emergency Dec on the orders right now. I personally on the subject matter have
been working on C.B.J Snyder schools there are four sister schools to this building and C.B.J
Snyder has about thirty-five landmark buildings. They are monumental enterprises to restore and
to repair and they end up sitting on people’s portfolios for decades. PS 31 is in an advanced
stage of structural unsalable. It’s really quite bad shape if we had a fire we would certainly lose
the south half of the building. We’ve had vagrants in the building and it’s been quite an effort
trying to keep them out. It is what it is we’ve secured the building we’ve boarded up we’ve
drained the basement there’s been a leak in there coming off the cellar for years as well. So
that’s the conditions where it is now. It’s structurally shored on the south side with timber,
timber sixteen years in there it’s all messed up on the structural side it can’t on its own without
the shoring right now.
The actual building itself is propped up by shores it’s been like that for a decade and it’s been
degrading to a point where we think it’s a terrible endangerment to the neighborhood. It’s highly
trafficked along there too because we see a lot of school kids and it’s got four public access ways
plus the playground to the side which is not where we really want to be. It is just unacceptable to
have the most endangered façade facing the playground. So that’s also an issue we did not like
at all being in a position that we had to tackle this thing again. In the interest of public safety we
have to pull the trigger and go for the demo on this thing. So our order stands as it is I amPg. 7
personally public safety is our highest ranking order on this issue in the interest of you know the
good citizens of the Bronx is our highest interest.
Mr. Ted Weinstein said that I will describe a little bit about the process what happened this year.
I know we were here in June and spoke and then I know Navardo was here in September at the
Full Board meeting. So what happened this year following hurricane Sandy DCAS asked the
Buildings Department to start taking a more aggressive look at the building that there was
obviously more damage something had to be decided. Then in April about the same time they
were completing a preliminary assessment DCAS and HPD received a request from SoBRO
saying that they would like to obtain the building and renovate it. We started to look at it and we
really started thinking you know something it’s really time to make a decision one way or the
other and we told SoBRO at the very, very beginning that first of all our general practice in
conveying city-owned properties is to go through a competitive process like a Request for
Proposals. We’ve been through the last several months reviewing proposals for the Bronxchester
the big land in back here and we hope to be able to make an announcement by next month about
the Development Team that has been selected for that and that is what we generally do with city-
owned property particularly in the last several years when we’re starting to run out of the
properties. So we told SoBRO that’s the first thing that we really have no basis to just selling or
giving that property PS 31 to them and we’re not going to get more housing out of it than if we
were to offer it lets say to somebody else which is really the idea of the competitive process like
an RFP. So we were excited about the idea we started saying you know what you know we have
been there again in the middle of the last decade the person who was then my Deputy
Commissioner and I had taken Artspace around to see it and he said lets’ see now if maybe it is
possible although the city decided way back that it really wasn’t let’s make one final decision
particularly given the current state as a result of the hurricane.
So we contacted Artspace because again they are the people that do this type of thing we wanted
to get their opinion and they came in and they looked and they were interested as well. So here
we had two proposals from SoBRO and Artspace and we said well let’s start taking a serious
look at it. We asked our Finance people to take a look at the numbers because things just don’t
happen something like this is going to cost millions and millions of dollars does it make sense is
it feasible is it really in the public interest to do this. We also then started to ask our architect
and engineers take a look at what’s being proposed does it make sense is it physically and
financially feasible and therefore in the public interest in trying to renovate this building into
affordable housing and that’s no small part of this because you just don’t say okay you’re going
to take a building that’s not housing that doesn’t have apartments and create apartments will they
be reasonable apartments will the building lend itself to becoming housing or not. These were
all the factors that we started taking to place.Pg. 8
As the months went by those efforts increased because again in consultation with the other
agencies we knew that the clock was running because we knew that there is a safety issue here.
At the beginning the city was excited about the idea of possibly doing this but the more that
everybody looked at it the more that our architects and engineers and they met with SoBRO and
Artspace. They met with their consultants and their engineers and contractors and the more that
everybody looked into it and the more that calculations were made and what would have to be
done. It’s not simply that okay we’re fine here we’re going to put in some new drywall or
something like that there is a lot involved in something like this. The more it starts to become
apparent that this isn’t just like taking some big vacant lot and saying okay we’re going to build
from scrap we’re going to build a nice building. This would be a very complicated a very
expensive endeavor without even knowing for sure ultimately where it would go. Sometimes
again let’s say you take a building that was built in the 1930’s a nice solid building that’s been
empty but in basic good condition those are the kind of things that our agency does all the time.
But here there are a lot of unknowns the project could start and then you start tearing things
down taking down the facade and then trying to figure out how to put it back and replace it these
are all complicated things that you might not even know where you’re heading toward at that
point. So after a lot of discussion a lot of research a lot of evaluation decision came got to the
point where decision made that really it isn’t physically and financially feasible it really isn’t in
the public interest to try to convert this building into residential housing. It just doesn’t make
sense. It would also take a very long time. These are things that just don’t happen overnight
either. Developers coming to us seeking money to build buildings and renovate buildings
they’ve got to get financing and various types of financing. The financing that’s being proposed
to renovate this building would include a lot of fund raising such as from Foundations and that’s
no sure thing. So there was just a lot of things about this that were unclear and what we did
know wasn’t on the positive side.
So eventually we come to the point where our engineers, our architects, our finance people
speaking to our Assistant Commissioners our Deputy Commissioners the Commissioner herself
and to City Hall the feeling was that this really just doesn’t make sense and it really is not in the
public interest to do this. So we let that be known and then people then started notifying some of
the other stakeholders I know the District Manager was notified. We promised that as soon as
the decision was made and people started being notified the Community Board via the District
Manager would be notified. Public Officials who been involved in the area some of whom went
to PS 31 and emotionally were very interested in seeing it renovated but realistically they
understood the condition that it’s in. Some of them actually went themselves and did the tours
within to see the inside and see what it’s like. Like we had said in the past we promised that we
would come back and once the decision was made explain that decision and these calls these
notifications have all just made like in the pastPg. 9
week or so. So we asked to be on the agenda for the next Housing-Land Use committee meeting
and so that’s why we’re here tonight to explain how that decision was made and how we came to
it and where we are now.
So this is the timeline that’s projected so last Friday the Department of Buildings issued an
Emergency Declaration which recommends the demolition of the building. We’re willing to
come back next week to your Full Board meeting to explain to the Full Board and then the
process will start. Because this is a landmark and because it’s not an immediate Emergency
Declaration there is a process that still has to go through. DCAS I believe has submitted an
application to the Landmarks Commission saying that based on the Declaration from the
Buildings Department and based on its history and the fact that efforts have been made looking
into the possibility of trying to salvage the building that they feel that the demolition is
warranted. The Landmarks Commission will hold a Public Hearing on that in and fact they
would like to hear from the Community Board about the Community Board’s position on this.
So they will be meeting on December 10th the Landmark Preservation Commission so we’re
asking for a vote from them.
In the meantime the abatement process one of the things I didn’t mention was asbestos there is a
lot of asbestos in there and that has to be handled a certain prescribed way to carefully remove it
and bring it someplace. You don’t just tear down the walls with asbestos and then throw it out
into a dumpster in the street it has to be handled in a very specific way and so that has to start to
be done. Eventually we presume that there will be a decision that demolition is warranted by
everybody and so Landmarks Preservation Commission hopefully will assemble and then issue a
report to that effect.
Even though HPD made a decision that it’s not warranted not feasible to renovate it’s not our
property it’s DCAS’s property but were the demolition agency for the city and so when the
Department of Buildings issues Declarations that recommend demolition that actually goes back
to HPD and we have a Demolition Unit that they contract out with Contractors to demolish
buildings that need to be demolished. This is sort of significant and noteworthy that very often
that could be somebody has an old garage next to their one-family house that’s falling apart that
it’s a threat a danger so the owner itself isn’t taking care of it and then HPD will send out a
Contractor to demolish it. We put out these types of Declarations all the time for all types of
buildings and structures and so that comes back to HPD to our Demolition Seal up Unit that
process is not fast either. I know somebody mentioned to me that they said that once the
decision was made the building was going to be torn down almost immediately it doesn’t work
that way.
What does have to happen is that HPD and its Contractor has to make sure for example Con EdPg. 10
that all the power is shut off because you can’t start tearing it down while there’s electricity
going through if there’s any other needed permits. Even the city can’t just go into a building and
start tearing it down you need permits from the Buildings Department. That’s part of the process
so there’s a lot of steps that have to take place but eventually that will lead to sometime early in
2014 February, March, April depends on the weather is a factor and unfortunately it’s worked
out timing wise that it’s now the bad weather is coming in that could delay things because you’re
not going to be doing this kind of work in the middle of a snowstorm but hopefully then by early
in the year so that the actual demolition can start and because of the nature of the building and
the size of the building that could take some time also that could take some number of months.
But hopefully then sometime in the first third of next year I guess the building should be gone
and of course there will be sidewalk sheds and bridges to protect the public from whatever is
going on.

Public Session
Think Positive World Global Initiative
Mr. David Giller, founder said that our vision is to accelerate positive change in communities
around the world. We spent a lot of time in Florida testing out a lot of our programs. We just
had a very successful pilot program for Think Positive Bronx and we worked with PS 55 over on
St Paul’s Place with amazing results with the children over there. We have a program called I’m
a Person it’s a self esteem program and much more than that it’s an anti-bullying program. It’s
based on what we call the ten daily fundamentals to greater well being which is posture,
breathing, exercise, pacing ourselves throughout the day, nutrition, positive environment, love,
kindness and empathy for others and a few more. It’s a very powerful program. The children at
PS 55 are literally stopped bullying. We had 700 student’s 220 sponsors and the children
became more respectful of one another, their teachers, parents and community. The results with
regard to attendance they had the highest in years anywhere from 92 to 96 percent. The number
of behavioral incidents was down over 200 percent in the course of 1 year. So for one week we
did I’m a Person. I’m a Person Week was created as a result of a song called I’m a Person it can
be referred to as everybody’s anthem. It’s a very important song which we are in the process of
translating into every language and getting out there across the world. I’m a Person program was
created around the song but it’s much more than a song and the results are indicative of that.
So what we are looking to do right now is we want to go into 100 schools in the Bronx and
around the city. But as many schools as possible in the Bronx. Our vision is to have 100 schools
to do the program and then to go to Yankee Stadium and have a walk-a-thon and rally forpositive change with the 100 schools present. So this is what our vision is we’ve gathered a lot
of support politically and with the clergy around the city especially in the Bronx. So we have a
lot of support and I’m here to ask for your support of this program. We’re looking to get 100
school Principals to give us a non binding letter of interest that they would like to do the program
so that we could take them to corporate sponsors and get the money to do it. Next year we’re
planning a bus tour to go to 12 states and 15 cities around the country to plant the seed of
positivity. This is a very comprehensive program that is really going to impact entire
communities.
New York City Police Department – 40th Police Precinct
Deputy Inspector McCormack said that right now the 40 we’re struggling big time in crime with
a spike in robberies, grand larcenies, burglaries. We just made a nice arrest with the burglaries
we had one suspect under surveillance for a long time he was doing commercial burglaries over
here on Third Avenue we got him the other day. We just indicted him which is fantastic. We
finally got him coming out of a place with burglary tools. We’re still struggling with the grand
larcenies of cell phones it was always the iPhone products but now we’re seeing this new Galaxy
phone that’s being targeted. They’re out there watching what kind of phone you have and taking
them. So we’re struggling on 138th Street in and around Mott Haven again so we’re putting a lot
of resources in that area.
The one great fantastic news that we have is that right now down over 50 percent in shootings.
The 41st just had two people shot so the hot summer is coming and we’re hoping to keep the
violence down. But I’m hoping again I came here with 72 shootings and my goal is to keep them
under 35 if I can cut it down to 50 percent in two years. It’s not secret we’re targeting the crews
and the guys doing it. We had the Mott Haven take down that had done 12 to 15 shootings, the
Betances and MMG kids of Moore Houses they did about 12 shootings and we had the Maria
Lopez buildings that were doing a lot of shootings. So we’re targeting the right people and
putting a couple of cases together right now for a little surprise for some people. Homicide is
down 50 percent. Unfortunately we had a woman killed by her son, one drug addict killed
another drug addict and the young 6 year old kid shot and killed at twelve o’clock in the
afternoon on 142nd Street over a girl. Two out of three are solved and hopefully we’re going to
get this third one solved as quickly as possible.

Chairman & District Manager’s Report
The District Manager introduced Mr. Alex Zablocki, Director of Community Relations for the
New York City Department of Homeless Services.
Mr. Alex Zablocki said that many of you know of our agency our mission is to provide shelter
services to those that are facing a housing crisis that’s open to anyone that comes to us they have
a right to shelter and we must provide that to them. We also besides being the largest shelter
system in the country run a very extensive network for homeless prevention. Something that
we’ve focused on even more so over the last year under the leadership of Commissioner Seth
Diamond whom you may have heard over the last few days is actually leaving the agency to go
work for the state so we will be welcoming in a new Commissioner in about two weeks. Our
Commissioner has met for the past almost three years now with Community Boards throughout
his tenure at the Budget Borough Consults. He’s spoken to Cedric directly I believe as well as
other members including the Bronx Borough President and Elected Officials across your
borough and of course across the city and has listened to your concerns and he’s also given
feedback as to what we do as an agency. I wanted to come tonight in order to present to you
what we do and what we’ve been doing in terms of homeless prevention what services are
available in this community, in the Bronx and our city and certainly get feedback on the work
we’re doing in this district.
As I mentioned Homeless Services operates a large homeless prevention network and their work
is run through the offices of Homebase. The office located here in this community is run by
BronxWorks. Homebase is opened to people facing a housing crisis possibly facing eviction.
Maybe behind in their rent but not evicted yet, can’t pay their utility bill possibly they are in
some disagreement with the landlord and facing a housing crisis because of that or maybe living
with Mom and Dad and there is some disagreement so they may be turning to the shelter system
in order to provide housing in the future Homebase is there to help them.
So Homebase has helped tens of thousands of families since it was created in 2006. Since then
everyone that has come to Homebase 90 percent of them have not entered the shelter system
which is good news. Last year using Federal stimulus dollars we started this campaign this was
one of target communities that we focused on across the city because we knew that there were
more households coming to us from this area and other areas in the Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn
and Manhattan than any other area. We targeted this campaign to those families that may have
been facing a housing crisis but might have not known that these services were available. Wespent about 1.2 million dollars on this campaign and in our Homebase office citywide we saw a
30 percent increase in the need for homeless prevention services. So it really shows not only the
great need for prevention services but also the great need for shelter services if you didn’t have
something like this in place. In addition to Homebase we also have three anti-eviction legal
services in the Bronx and in this community through Bronx Housing Court we actually have
providers and they work with Judges. So if someone didn’t get to Homebase, didn’t know
services were available or received an eviction notice and came to court we actually have
providers funded by the city to work directly with households so that we can prevent the eviction
in the courthouse keep people in their home and figure out if they may be eligible for some
subsidy like the Federal Eviction Prevention supplement a five-year subsidy for anyone who has
been evicted or maybe a one-shot deal from HRA or some other services that we can provide
that household so that they do not enter the shelter system. The less people that enter our system
the less shelters we need to build in our community and it’s certainly more cost effective to the
taxpayer. So prevention services are working in the city and it is something major cities across
the nation are replicating what we’re doing here with Homebase. We’ve also testified on this not
only in the City Council but it’s been a part of other discussions federally in Washington and
across our state and elsewhere about using this model across the city. So think of it as a one-stop
shop if you know of anyone that might be facing a housing crisis refer them to Homebase.
We also run the largest shelter system in the country again. Shelter in New York City is a right.
That means any single adult male or female that comes to us we must have a bed for them no
questions asked there is no eligibility. On the family side families with children and adult
families you also have a right to shelter but we look at your housing history and there is an
eligibility process to that. So anyone that has been evicted is homeless possibly coming off the
streets they lost their apartment can’t get help from Homebase and has to come to us they would
enter one of the intake points for whatever type of family or single adult they are. All families
with children enter one intake point in the city and that’s called Path located in Community
Board #1. We’re serving families there twenty-four hours a day seven days a week 365 days a
year. Any new applicants that come to us are placed in the shelter ten days we call conditionally
where we review their two-year housing history and see if they are eligible for services. Anyone
reapplying for services can also go back to Path. HRA is also located at Path the floating
hospital for any medical needs ACS the NOVA unit which is No Violence Again looking for any
domestic violence issues and we also have what’s called resource room at Path which helps
working with families that may have been ineligible or can be diverted from shelter where we
can either reconnect them with family or we can find them other housing outside of the shelter
system. Adult families are typically couples that are older say senior couple or mom with a child
over the age of twenty-one. Their intake point is on East 30th & First Avenue in Manhattan and
they also go through eligibility and have the same conditional placement. Now single adults
male go to one intake point the same place as adult families we can’t ask questions for singles so
they get a bed if they come to us there is no eligibility. For single females they would go to two
entry points one on the Bronx on Franklin Avenue and in Brooklyn on Williams Avenue again
there is not eligibility for them we must give them a bed when they come to us. So that means
that our agency must continually expand as more people come to us or contract if the census
goes down.About eighteen months ago the agency attempted to institute eligibility at the front door for
single adults in order to see if we could divert more single males and females at the front door
back into the community. We would have looked at one year housing history instead of two and
there were some people that we would not have looked at their housing history. However the
City Council sued us and we were prevented from instituting eligibility so for right now we must
continue providing services to anyone that comes to us on the single side. We also provide
twenty-four hour a day street services we have teams across the city in all five boroughs out
there seven days a week you are provided here by BronxWorks and they are doing an amazing
job.
It’s a great success that we’ve reduced the number of people living on the streets of our city by
two-thirds compared to Los Angeles there 13,000 living on the streets in New York City it is just
over 3,000. 412 families last year entered the shelter system from this Community Board. In
this Community Board there are six shelters five families with children shelters and one single
adult shelter. We have 250 shelters citywide we operate directly eleven of them the rest are
operated by contract providers BronxWorks, Help USA and Woman In Need. Out of the twelve
Community Boards in the Bronx two do not have shelters and out of the other Boards this Board
ranks number five. So there are five other Boards in the Bronx that have more shelters than this
Board.
Finally we serve everyone whether you’re a resident of the state, from a different country, citizen
or not we do not turn anyone away.

Public Session
Mayor’s Office
Mr. Nivardo Lopez, Bronx Borough Director/Citywide Latino Outreach said that I’m here today
to talk about an initiative that we started in the Mayor’s Office that specifically affects
Community Board 1. The Mayor today made an announcement regarding the food waste
challenge and that’s very briefly back in 2007 Plan YC one of the goals was to reduce the city’s
solid food waste by 75 percent. So today’s announcement about the food waste challenge is that
we have a 100 restaurants that have agreed to reduce their food waste by 50 percent and they are
going to engage in composting and other initiatives to sort of reduce the amount of waste that the
Department of Sanitation has to pickup and then send out to landfill. It is an initiative in order to
reduce the amount of waste we send to landfill and would also save the city millions of dollars
going forward.
We also announced today the new Community Garden initiative. The city has identified twenty
locations throughout New York City that are city owned lots vacant and not being used and we
want to transform into Community Gardens. The specific name of the initiative is the Gardens
for Health Communities. Last year the Mayor announced an initiative the Mayor’s Obesity
Taskforce Plan in January 2012 and in May the taskforce put out a report it was for twenty-six
initiatives that would reduce obesity in New York City. The most famous one as you all know
was the soda ban. But that was one of twenty-six initiatives we put out to combat obesity in New
York City that we feel is a rising threat to the health and well being of New Yorkers. Actually
obesity is the second leading cause of health problems in the city after smoking. Number fifteen
on the list was this Community Garden Program. We’ve identified twenty locations and two of
them are here in Community Board 1, one is located on Westchester Avenue, between St. Ann’s
& Eagle Avenues and the second is at 757 Melrose, between 157th & 156th. This program is
going to be administered by the Parks Department Green Thumb Program but what differentiates
these locations from other Community Gardens is that Green Thumb is going to solicit
applications from community group. They are going to select a group or groups depending on
the location to administer the garden and Green Thumb will provide the supplies in order totransform these lots into productive gardens. They are going to sort of supply raised beds, rain
water harvesting systems and also work with the community groups for participatory design and
workshops how to garden, what to garden and how to maintain the site properly. The application
for community gardens is online now you can receive it if you go to www.greenthumb.nyc.gov.
Fed Cap Employment Works
Mr. Warwick Williams, Partner Coordinator said that I’m with Fed Cap Employment Works and
we’re a division of Fed Cap and Fed Cap Rehabilitation Services. The organization was started
in 1935 by a group of disabled war veterans. They found out that they could not find
employment or a means to support themselves after being or serving in the war and the bottom
line is they developed an organization to help people that had challenges and barriers to
becoming self-sufficient. That has evolved into a larger organization we are throughout New
York City and what we do is work with veterans, people who have disabilities, youth and adults.
We help people to become self-sufficient through employment, education and vocational
training.
My particular program which is located in the Hunts Point area of the Bronx services Bronx and
Manhattan residents. We help people who have what I like to call court involvement find and
maintain long term meaningful employment. So when I say court involvement that’s what we
teach our particular clients our customers to say when they are out there looking for work.
Specifically it is people with criminal court convictions and the reason why I use court
involvement because it doesn’t have that same negative stigma that someone would get if they
said that I’m on parole or probation. How we get our clients jobs is rather simple but it is a
challenge. What we do is identify companies that are currently hiring they have opened position
or positions. Once we find a business or corporation that has an open position the next questions
we ask that particular business is will you work with someone who has court involvement?
When we go past the work court involvement to exactly what the court problem this person has
is only because the end user may say I was not told this person had issues. The bottom line is we
let the businesses know that these particular candidates may or may not have issues. In other
words when the candidate goes in front of that business I don’t say to that particular organization
this individual for example has an aggravated assault in 20004. All our clients do not have
criminal convictions overall in the company. We want the businesses to be receptive to the
people who are coming to their doors to gain employment. So we do not use the words criminal
convictions.
So the businesses know that we are bringing to the table individuals that are qualified and have
been trained to do specific jobs. We have culinary, security, maintenance, career design school
and do data imaging. But the bottom line is this any business if I were to walk down Third
Avenue right now and go into Forman Mills next door and I would ask that particular hiring
Manager do you have any open positions and if he says yes then the next questions is would you
work with some who has a background or a history if they say yes then those are the companies
that now become our best friends. Those are the only companies that we’re sending our clients
to because they have been vetted out to be receptive to this particular population. Once a
company has said yes this is where we start our work at we help the clients prepare theirprofessional documentation resumes, cover letter, thank you letters and letters of
recommendation. We also train our clients or educate our clients on how to answer interview
questions effectively there are roughly 15 to 16 interview questions that a company normally
asks. More importantly our particular population has to answer a very challenging question and
makes a lot of people ill at ease based on their scenario the criminal conviction question. The
point is this if a client knows going in the door how to answer those questions well he or she will
have what we like to call a successful interview.
New York Restoration Project
Ms. Janet Brouthton, Project Manager discussed the renovation being performed at the Willis
Avenue Community Garden on East 143rd Street. NYRP recently received funding to renovate
the space. There were 3 community input sessions held on the design. We now have a final
design. The existing and final design for the garden was shown to the Board.

Chairman & District Manager’s Report
The District Manager said that there would be a presentation by Ms. Lanny Alexander, Executive
Director of the New York City Loft Board.
Ms. Lanny Alexander, Executive Director said that the New York State Dwelling Law – the
Loft Law allows for New Yorkers to live in some of what were formerly commercial and
manufacturing loft spaces if certain requirements are met. Non-residential buildings used as
homes during a specific time periods may be designated as interim multiple dwellings or IMDs.
For Loft Law protection, a building must be registered as an IMD or its tenants may apply for
Loft Law protection. Eligibility for the Loft Law includes that the loft unit must have at least
one window facing a street, legal yard or courtyard; must be at least 550 square feet and not in a
basement or cellar; the building may not be in an industrial business zone (other than
Greenpoint/Williamsburg, North Brooklyn and certain Long Island City Industrial business zone
area; and as of June 21, 2010 the building may not have been used for certain activities that are
inherently incompatible with residential use.If you’re living in a building that is in a mixed use area and you don’t have a certificate of
occupancy what are you, you’re illegal. In a mixed use area the owner can renovate the building
and make it a class (A) apartment, doesn’t need the Loft Law. But if tenants bring the owner
into the Loft Law then he will have to renovate and bring it up to building code. Wouldn’t you
want to be covered by the Loft Law. But mostly this is for areas that are not mixed use.
By the way you have an IBZ in your area that is excluded from Loft Law coverage. You cannot
have loft tenants recognized in the IBZ. That is commercial manufacturing no Loft Law. Under
the 2010 amendment there were only three IBZ’s that were included as possibly being covered
under the Loft Law. The remaining IB Zs are excluded. So that area is not going to have Loft
Law coverage. But if you have an M zone somewhere not a mixed use and there’s a commercial
use there and people living there they are going to want to be covered.
The reason I am telling you this tonight is because in a couple of months all of the Loft Law
rules would have been published and enacted. That means there will be a statue of limitations a
time period within which tenants in your Community Board district will be able to apply for Loft
Law coverage. If they don’t know about it they can’t use it and that’s why I’m here. What we
want to see is that the tenants live in a safe environment and that the owners behave properly. So
we keep everybody on the straight and narrow that’s my job. But my job here tonight is to tell
you that I see signs as I go through the Bronx loft building call so and so. I don’t know what
kind of lofts they’re talking about. I don’t know what particular zoning it has, whether its mixed
use or not what I want to make sure is that those people who are living in the Bronx take
advantage of this law just like the people in Brooklyn and Manhattan are doing. So we want to
make sure that you spread the word to your constituents and say if you’re living in a building that
was zoned manufacturing and is use manufacturing or commercial let them know about the Loft
Law.

Public Session
State Senator Jose M. Serrano
State Senator Jose Serrano said that I just try as often as possible to come by all the Community
Boards I represent just to say hello and make sure that you know how to contact me and
everyone knows Angel Santana who is my representative here at the Board. Many of you I’ve
known for a very long time and it’s a pleasure to work with you all of these years. The
community continues to change and evolve and there are so many issues that continue to pop up
and I really do enjoy working with all of you.
So I won’t go into detail about my report you see all the issues there we’ve been working on gun
control. We’ve been working on issues that are important to immigrants and now my big push is
the minimum wage which I think is so critically important. One thing to keep in mind many of
the opponents of the minimum wage say quote, unquote that it is a job filler but to the contrary
businesses I believe would benefit so much from an increase in minimum wage because it would
increase the buying power in our neighborhoods, and community. It would be a direct economic
impact on our local merchants here. So I think it’s something that we will get done this year.
I’m hoping even though the Republicans are being very obstructionist on this issue I look
forward to getting it done.
Please free to call me reach out to me if there’s anything that I can be helpful with.New York City Police Department 40th Police Precinct
Deputy Inspector Christopher McCormack said that I’m just going to give you guys a heads up
to what has happened. Everyone knows that the other day on Tuesday a son killed his Mother
and chopped her up and put her body parts all over the district.

the maps citywide on flood plains and elevations.
I would tell everybody that you should put together a Go Bag and a list of people in your family
with contact information on it and a list of medicines for those that need it. The reason why I say
this is because for two years in a row September, October and November there have been storms.
I want the people in this community to be prepared I don’t want to see anyone lose their
valuables or more importantly their lives and I say this because we’re right on the Harlem River.The District Manager said that the Health-Human Services Committee along with NYU College

Salvation ArmyMr. Mike Burgos, Director of Family Shelters for the Salvation Army. The Salvation Army was
founded in 1865 they had their initial experience running private shelters beginning in 1891
starting in Greenwich Village.
Currently we have six shelters that we’re operating at this time. The first one is the Kingsboro
men shelter the Army has operated this shelter in Brooklyn since 1997 it has the capacity of 80
adults initially and was expanded by DHS in 2009 to 118 clients, again in 2010 to 126 clients,
and again in 2013 to 141 clients. This shelter serves homeless men and women who are mentally
ill and chemically addicted. We also run a shelter here in the Bronx the Franklin Women’s
Assessment Shelter designed to assess the needs of homeless women and develop plans to refer
them to appropriate transitional settings also any needed services like medical programs,
substance abuse treatment and programs in housing within twenty-one days. Franklin provides
medical services and psychiatric evaluations as part of its in-depth client assessment.
The Salvation Army has been operating shelters since 2000 initially Franklin was a 100 bed
shelter and in November of 2005 DHS increased the capacity to 200 beds. DHS just asked the
Salvation Army recently to provide shelter support for the population made by super storm
Sandy. Our next shelter is Northport Veteran Shelter located in the center of Northport, Long
Island with a capacity of 51 male and female adults serving veterans from Nassau and Suffolk
counties. Services offered to Northport veteran shelter include case management, money
management programs, recovery groups, employment training and other referrals for permanent
housing.
We have currently three family shelters that we’re operating two are located in Queens the first
one is Briarwood Family Shelter in Jamaica, Queens a 91 bed facility for families very similar to
the Jackson Shelter in the Bronx. We have another one similar to that in the Springfield area of
Queens and that house’s 82 beds for women and children. Recently it was a typical Tier II
Family Shelter but beginning in February of 2012 DHS asked us if this facility could be
transitioned to a next step shelter. A next step shelter is a more intense shelter for families who
are characterized as not compliant for families that have been in shelters 12 months plus and not
compliant in a number of areas can be referred to a next step shelter. We provide more intense
case management and case involvement. We also operate another Tier II Family Shelter in the
Bushwick area of Brooklyn, New York an 87 bed unit very similar to Briarwood.
I do want to say that we’re running three family shelters so we’ve created a centralized
management structure meaning that we have a team of Directors that actually function in all
three sites. I as the Executive Leader am overseeing all three shelters but we also have a
Director of Operations that provides directions, procedures and quality assurance to ensure that
we are operating under the guidelines of DHS and the State. We also have a Director of Social
Services providing leadership for a huge Social Service Team that we have at all three sites and
also ensuring that we are operating and running the shelter in the model that is prescribed by
DHS. We have a Director of Facilities responsible for the facility itself the infrastructure and
working with DHS to repair any discrepancies that may occur.
The Salvation Army offers a lot more than that we have 140 programs throughout New York
City they comprise daycare, after school programs, developmental disability services, emergencydisaster services, HIV services, hunger prevention services and a history of working with the
poorest of the poor. We look forward to developing relationships in the Bronx District No. 1.
Bronxworks
Mr. Ken Smalls said that he was the Development Director for Bronxworks the organization that
many of you have known previously as Citizens Advice Bureau. I want to talk briefly about
Bronxworks overall and a little bit in terms of the services that Bronxworks has provided at the
Jackson Avenue Family Residence since it opened in 1995. Also have with me Mr. Thomas
Lumpkin who is the Director of Security for the residence.
We have had a significant presence in Bronx Community Board 1 going back more than 20
years. We have a Senior Center in the Roberts Moore Houses that we been contracted with the
Department for the Aging going back to the early 1990’s. In addition Bronxworks has had a
Workforce Development Center located on the 149th Street HUB that has been in operation way
back to 1998. The Workforce Development Center last year engaged about 1600 persons and
helped about 600 people find employment. We became the sponsor of the Betances Community
Center as a result of getting a grant from the New York City Department of Youth and
Community Development in 2010 providing services for children, young adults, working age
adults as well as seniors. Those are some services that we have here in Community Board 1.
Bronxworks is the Bronx based organization that has responsibility for the Homeless Outreach
Team. We’ve had the contract to provide Homeless Outreach Team Services going back to
1995. Between 2005 and 2012 here in the Bronx there’s been a 71 percent decline in the number
of street homeless persons and the Bronxworks Homeless Outreach Team is largely responsible
for that decline. We’re also the organization that is responsible for two of the largest eviction
prevention programs here in the Bronx. The formerly eviction prevention subsidy program
which some of you may know as Jiggets and some of you may know as the Homeless Prevention
Program as a result of having this program over the last 20 years we have literally been able to
keep tens of thousands of families out of the shelter system and into permanent housing. A
similar program we’ve had now for about 5 years specifically targets families here in
Community Board 1 as well as Community Board 4 that program is called Home Base and last
year this program worked with 750 families and approximately 1700 people also keeping them in
permanent housing and out of the shelter system.
Bronxworks has had the contract to provide services at the Jackson Avenue Family Residence
since it opened in 1995. Wanda Cruz is the Director of the shelter there is also on site a Social
Service Director. In addition Bronxworks has worked for a number of years with the
organization Care for the Homeless to provide onsite medical care to the families who reside at
the residence. As part of our transition process we work with the Morris Heights Health Center
which has a location not too far from the shelter. We do provide additional Social Services on
site we have a number of Case Managers on site that work very closely with the families to help
them resolve whatever issues they may have. Of course with the shelter being a place that isdesigned to move people into permanent housing our major concern is to see to it that those who
are at the shelter not only find permanent housing but are able to stay in permanent housing. So
we place a very heavy emphasis to seeing to it that those who are in the shelter when they leave
that they have the appropriate benefits and supports to see to it that they and their family are able
to realize self-sufficiency and not return to the Jackson or any other shelter in the system. We
have educational and recreational services provided on site and we found our own money to
build a playground for the shelter.
